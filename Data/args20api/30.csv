S9f12e0e6-Af342659e	Adults, without violence related felonies, should have the right to carry a concealed firearm.	"To start out carrying a concealed handgun in public is permitted in all 50 states as of 2013, when Illinois became the last state to enact concealed carry legislation. Some states require gun owners to obtain permits while others have ""unrestricted carry"" and do not require permits. Proponents of concealed carry say that criminals are less likely to attack someone they believe to be armed. They cite the 2nd Amendment's ""right of the people to keep and bear arms,"" and argue that most adults who legally carry a concealed gun are law-abiding and do not misuse their firearms. Opponents of concealed carry argue that increased gun ownership leads to more gun crime and unintended gun injuries. They contend that concealed handguns increase the chances of arguments becoming lethal, and that society would be safer with fewer guns on the street, not more. The only state/district in the USA that prohibits carrying and concealing firearms (Washington DC) has more than double the highest violent crime rate in the US. This does not include American Samoa and the north Mariana islands. SOURCES:/ http://www.usacarry.com... https://www.census.gov..."	PRO	1
S9f12e0e6-Ab4a3568a	Adults, without violence related felonies, should have the right to carry a concealed firearm.	I see what you're saying, but even if they don't have violence related felonies, they could still do damage. They could use that concealed fire arm that they carry, to force someone to do something, to scare someone or even get carried away with that power. Sure criminals might be less likely to attack the person with the gun, if they knew it was there, and even if they don't know that it's there they might take it from the gun owner. And if the gun owner actually got to the point where he had to use it, most likely it would go wrong. Police take weeks, maybe even months to train with their guns, while gun owners usually train for a day or two. Also what would happen if that gun went off accidentally? Someone or some people could be seriously injured or worse killed. Leave the gun handling to the professionals. This is why I believe that Adults, without violence related felonies, should not have the right to carry a concealed firearm. Sources: http://concealedcampus.org...	CON	2
Sbe1c3672-A9c577c33	Right to carry arms	"I, being the pro,am going to affirm the resolution and prove why people should be allowed to carry arms. I will ask that voters cast their vote in this round based on who debates the resolution better and not based on your own personal decisions. Keep in mind that I have no strong views on either side, but want to practise my debating skills. Thanks! In this debate, I am going to prove to you why adult individuals should have the right to carry a concealed handgun. On to my case - I wish to offer 2 points in this round to show that the decision to make carrying arms in the US a legal right was a good one. Firstly, Criminals are less likely to attack someone that they believe might be armed. The deterrent effect of concealed carry benefits the individual carrying a handgun as well as the general public because criminals never know who is armed. With the right to carry arms in place, the general public can move around the country without having to worry about criminals, and areas that generally contain a lot of people who commit crimes. This is further proved by the fact that, according to a study by Dr. John Lott, ""shall-issue"" laws have reduced homicides by 8.5%, aggravated assaults by 7%, and robberies by 3%. Lott argued that if states that did not permit concealed handguns in 1992 had permitted them in 1977, 1570 murders, 60,000 aggravated assaults, and 12,000 robberies would have been prevented between 1977 and 1992. These figures may seem insignificant at first, but when you're part of one the 1,570 families who lost someone they loved, it suddenly matters a WHOLE lot more. Secondly, One of the arguments against giving the right to carry arms to adults is that the public isn't ready to handle the responsibility of a gun, and that they might take to shooting and use the tool made for self-defence to harm other innocent civilians, but, most of the adults who own concealed handguns are law abiding. This is proved by the fact that according to a report by engineering statistician William Sturdevant published on the Texas Concealed Handgun Association website, the general public is now 5.7 times less likely to be arrested for violent offenses, and 13.5 times less likely to be arrested for non-violent offenses, in comparison to before. This, therefore, refutes any argument about the public not being able to handle the responsibilities of a gun. I now give the (online)stage to my opponent, and wish him/her good luck."	PRO	3
S4d21044-A6059bd1b	Concealed carry laws help reduce violent crime	"I thank my opponent for hosting this debate. I will show that concealed carry laws do not reduce violent crime in any significant, measurable way. Many states have ""shall issue"" laws, mainly because it is considered a fundamental right. I am not against this. However, the idea that such laws actually reduce crime is an illusion. Although there may be a deterrent effect of concealed carry laws, there are also other effects that cause an increase of violent crime. Let me mention a few: Obviously, concealed weapons are used in crimes. Take for example road rage. Michael Dunn, a concealed weapon carrier, was convicted of first degree murder when he shot into an SUV with teenagers because of loud music. Nearby in my state Michigan, a father was shot in front of his family after a road rage confrontation with a concealed carry permit holder [4]. Murder by CCW holders are relatively rare, but they do happen. Another, in my opinion more important, factor is that concealed carry laws leads to more risky and confrontational behavior of the concealed weapon carrier. Studies have shown that carrying a weapon makes a person more paranoid [2]. Take for example the well publicized George Zimmermann case [3]. He followed Trayvon Martin which led to a violent confrontation. A violent crime was committed, although one may argue who the perpetrator was. It seems unlikely that Zimmermann would have followed Martin had he not been armed. The (false) sense of security of a concealed weapon may lead to more confrontational behavior that can lead to violent crime, but the concealed carrier, or by someone else. Almost all studies do not take this kind of behavior change into account. Criminals have several choices. Instead of being deterred, they could also react to a concealed carry law by arming themselves more, to have the upper hand in a possible confrontation. Such behavior would lead to more violent crime. This effect has also not been taken into account in all the studies that have been cited. In particular, deterrence theory will give only a lopsided picture, because it assumes that the criminal only has 2 choices, either commit a crime, or not. So now we have some reasons of why concealed carry laws may increase violent crime, and also one reason why it might reduce violent crime. So which effect is greater? The National Academy of Sciences, THE authority in science matters, reviewed the science on this question (including the work of John Lott) and found ""There is no credible evidence that ""right-to-carry"" laws, which allow qualified adults to carry concealed handguns, either decrease or increase violent crime."" [5] The Academy studied 253 scientific journal articles, 99 books and 43 government publications. [1] http://www.cnn.com... [2] Biggs, A. T., Brockmole, J.R., & Witt, J.K. (2014).

S4d21044-Aa1133949	Concealed carry laws help reduce violent crime	- Clarification - Many terms may be used in this debate. One of them may be the term ‘shall issue’ laws. Shall issue laws are a form of liberalized concealed carry law. They generally mean if you meet the criteria of the law—including but not limited to—being 21 years of age or not having a violent criminal record, you will obtain this law. If you pass training and pass all requirements, you obtain the law. This is in contrast to may issue, meaning if you pass all of the requirements, you still may not be licensed as you need a ‘good reason’. No issue is self-explanatory. Concealed carry is banned, and you will never be issued a concealed carry permit. BOP I would argue both sides should be given equal burden of proofs. Although I am affirmative, CON is now against the status quo. Nearly all states have passed shall issue laws, and a few (Alaska, Arizona, Wyoming, Arkansas, Vermont) have no restrictions [8]. Therefore, I have a burden to prove that concealed carry laws do reduce crime, and CON must prove they either have no discernable effect or increase crime. C1) Deterrence theory This will provide theoretical reasons as to why concealed carry laws would decrease crime. Deterrence theory began in the 1960s under the groundbreaking research by now deceased economist Gary Becker. His work in the field of criminology is almost unmatched. His theory is now known as deterrence theory. The theory holds criminals are rational actors and will act rationally towards incentives and punishments. Indeed, Becker finds many criminals are in crime solely for payment: money. But others see the emotional thrill overweighs the costs of punishment. Essentially, criminals react to different forgings. If there is increased threat to them, they back down and are less likely to commit criminal acts [1]. This applies to concealed carry in a fairly obvious manner. If citizens are able to arm themselves, this increases the cost to the criminal. Citizens may now react violently towards criminal actors, either ending in a failed attack or even death. Armed citizens also could increase the chances which criminals are caught. Therefore, concealed carry laws significantly increase the risk of committing various crimes. Based on Becker’s theory, we should see a decrease in violent crime if people are now allowed to arm themselves. And concealed carry holds more of a deterrent than open carry. Open carry can and does deter criminals. However, it also means if you are a criminal you know who to avoid. This means either you will attack at a different place, or merely murder the carrier and then harm the defenseless masses. Concealed carry means the criminal is unaware as to who is armed. The criminal does not know when a civilian has the capacity to end his life. The criminal does not know who to attack first. The criminal is the one who will be taken by surprise. Although open carry does reduce crime, concealed carry is one of the strongest deterrence methods a civilian can possess. C2) How firearms affect crime rates Firearms have two effects on crime. First, they can increase crime. They do this by arming criminals. This can empower them to commit more crime or make the severity of their crimes more severe. However, firearms can also reduce crime. Arming citizens will both deter crime but also reduce the impact of crime. Defensive gun uses, for example, would reduce the impact of the crime, even though the crime is still attempted. The question is which effect is more important. Overall, firearms have been demonstrated to have little effect on crime, and gun control is largely ineffective. Gun control primarily affects law abiding citizens, meaning they even have the potential to increase crime [2]. So why is this relevant? Obviously, laws which give firearms primarily to law abiding citizens will reduce crime. Concealed carry laws chiefly arm law abiding citizens. This means the second effect—the crime reducing effect—is amplified by concealed carry laws. C3) Empirical research on right to carry laws What does the empirical literature reveal to us as to how concealed carry laws affect crime rates? The research begins with two scholars, John Lott and David Mustard. Their study took into account every single country in the United States. Their study found concealed carry laws would save the economy 6.2 billion dollars each year due to reduced crime impacts. Murder fell 7.7%, rape fell 5.3%, aggravated assault fell 7.01%, and robbery fell 2.2% [3]. John Lott’s work received criticism—which I am sure my opponent will mention. Regardless, the study received much praise, including from award winning criminologist Gary Kleck. Lott’s study was the first to utilize the entire country. Before him, studies would focus on small non-geographically representative areas. They studies every shall issue law passed between 1977 and 1992. Lott’s study attempted to control for many factors other than merely changes in shall issue laws in order to obtain the true effects—previous research did not. The study was also the first to focus on all types of crime, whereas studies before focused only on homicide. Although Kleck remained fairly skeptical of the studies conclusions, he noted the study proved concealed carry laws did not increase crime. He also conceded the study was the best designed study of publication to date [4]. There has been a few literature reviews on the topic. A recent one by John Lott in the Maryland Law Review summarizes the recent literature. Little research was found as to whether or not concealed carry laws increase accidental death rates. Of the evidence currently in existence, there seems to be no relationship between concealed carry laws and accidental deaths or suicides. There have been a total of 29 studies published by economists and criminologists on the issue. Of those, 18 supported the idea concealed carry laws reduced crime, 10 claimed no effect, and only one found an increase in crime. There are 5 different methods which have concluded concealed carry laws reduce crime. Authors of different political views have contributed to the idea that concealed carry laws reduce violent crime. If you extend the meta-analysis to include non-refereed studies, there are 21 studies which claim concealed carry laws reduce crime, 11 which claim no effect, and 3 claiming an increase. 60% of the literature, therefore, supports my position. Of the ones which claim increased crime, they have been found to be severely flawed. Ironically, they accuse Lott’s work of having coding errors. However, it was on a paper which he was not an author, and the coding errors did not affect the results. The ironic part is that their work is now notorious for coding errors, including having the same county in the dataset multiple times. Scholars have failed to reproduce their work, meaning it is highly unlikely these laws increase crime. The research claiming no effect also often makes errors—such as truncation bias—and when the errors are accounted for, they also find no increase in crime. Lott concludes, “the consensus is the same: right-to-carry laws reduce violent crime.” [5][6]. Some research even indicated concealed carry laws reduce police deaths. Before a law, states have a slightly higher chance of police deaths via shooting. After shall issue laws are passed, there is a slightly lower chance of being murdered if you are a police officer. Allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms does not endanger police officers—in fact, it may even protect them [7]. Conclusion Research on general firearms tells us one thing: Guns can both increase and decrease crime. Concealed carry laws primarily arm citizens, indicating the decreasing crime effects would become amplified. This means there should be large decreases in crime after shall-issue laws are passed. Research on general crime also gives credence to the idea. Criminals are rational actors and respond to incentives and costs. Concealed carry laws increases the cost for criminals, meaning they would be more hesitant in attacking citizens who may be armed. And research on concealed carry laws themselves almost unanimously argue these laws reduce crime. Unless my opponent really refutes C3, he loses the debate. [1] http://www.nber.org...

S4d21044-A58080ac6	Concealed carry laws help reduce violent crime	"The brutalization hypothesis The brutalization hypothesis is what Con tells us: the deterrent effect will be overrided by brutalization. CCW holders will become more brutal, commit crimes, and increase crime. But this effect has not been observed. Con cites a few anecdotal examples of crime committed by concealed carry holders, but even he admits that these are ""rare"". So it is very unlikely that they could override the deterrent effect as well as any defensive uses by CCW holders. Indeed, in Florida ""Crime rates involving gun owners with carry permits have consistently been about 0.02% of all carry permit holders since Florida""s right-to-carry law started in 1988"" [1]. Indeed, the brutalization effect is simply too small in order to increase crime rates. Con also claims carrying a gun makes you paranoid. However, it begs the question as to whether or not the gun causes the paranoia or whether or not they are paranoid and that is why they get the gun. It also begs the question as to whether or not increased paranoia leads to violent crimes. Indeed, concealed carry holders are the most law abiding group of citizens [2]. So, the question is to what effect""if any""will concealed carry have on crime rates. Gun carrying may increase paranoia, but my opponent must first prove that it will significantly impact crime rates""which is probably doesn""t, as concealed carry holders are the most law-abiding demographic. If they carriers are paranoid, it may even have a crime reducing effect. They may be paranoid because they are worried about crime, but this may lead them to be less confrontational and go to bad neighborhoods as they wish to avoid crime. Further evidence that CCW laws likely do not cause an increase in crime is that in recent years, crime has continued to decrease despite large increases in the amount of concealed carry holders [3]. Con also claims criminals may arm themselves due to these laws. This is unlikely, as extensive background checks occur in order to obtain a permit [2]. And as noted, guns can increase crime via criminal armament, but also decrease crime if the law affects law abiding citizens. It obviously arms law-abiding citizens more, as almost never do they commit crimes [2]. My opponent offers conjecture, whereas I provide empirical evidence. 2. NAS report Con""s empirical case relies solely upon the NAS report, using an appeal to authority in order to claim he is correct. But it should be noted my opponents quotation says we have no proof it increases crime or keeps it the same either""they merely want more research. They do not say John Lott is wrong, but that more research is needed. Second, the panel had Steven Levitt as one of their authors, who is a liberal who criticized John Lott before the report. Third, criminologist James Q Wilson wrote an extensive dissenting opinion arguing John Lott was correct [4]. A new reassessment of the NAS report has replicated Lott""s and the NAS regressions on crime. What is interesting is that the NAS data actually strongly correlates with Lott""s conclusions. From the study, ""James Q. Wilson was perfectly justified to conclude that right-to-carry laws reduced murders, since the NRC""s own regressions "" showed a significant negative effect on crime."" [5] The fact is, the NAS paper is not strong evidence against our position, and other research should be cited on the Con side in order for him to win the debate. [1] http://www.gunfacts.info...

Sbe1c3672-A5d4d0559	Right to carry arms	"Being Side Con, I wish to counter my opponent""s claim that private citizens should be allowed to carry firearms. I concur with my opponent""s criterion for judging this debate and ask all voters to not consider any outside information not explicitly brought up in the debate or the sources. That being said, Side Con""s three contentions are as follows: 1. Concealed firearm use leads to lethal violent crime. 2. Concealed firearms easily find their way into the hands of convicted felons. 3. Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense. Contention 1: Concealed firearms lead to lethal violent crime. The NRA loves telling the public stories of heroic storeowners hiding guns in their desks, successfully taking down thieves and various other assailants with lethal or non-lethal blows. Concealed firearms are thus portrayed as saviors. The NRA, however, does not tell every story. Meet Philip Davis, an Alabama police officer on duty on December 3rd, 2009. Davis pulls over pharmacist Bart Johnson for speeding. As Davis gave Johnson his ticket, Johnson ""fired one shot"" (1) from a concealed firearm, killing Davis instantly. Johnson had ""obtained a concealed weapons permit in 2007,"" a permit he had renewed in 2009. Davis is one of 516 people killed by individuals with concealed weapons, weapons legally concealed (2). Looking at an even broader scale, we find an alarming amount of violence arising from handgun use. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, handguns were the weapons used in 70% to 80% of all homicides committed from 1993 to 2011 (3). Using the lower number, 70%, we can therefore estimate criminals killed 148,676 people with handguns. And this does not include non-lethal shootings, nor the violence of the past year. Considering the weapons themselves, we find a very dangerous prospect: handguns are exceedingly easy to use. This is not to say a knife or a baseball bat cannot be deadly, but a semi-automatic handgun has a greater range and ease of use than either. All one needs to do is pull back a safety and pull the trigger repeatedly. Furthermore, the clip size of handguns can lead to multiple deaths in mere seconds. An AR-24 Armalite 9mm pistol has a 15 magazine; assuming the gun-wielder is a poor marksman, needing two shots to kill someone, he/she could still take out 7 people (4). So how does this link to the resolution? Quite simply, as useful as concealed firearms seem for self-defense, they are definitely used for criminal, homicidal purposes. They are a threat to public safety. And though some lives have been saved by handguns, just as many, if not more, have been lost. Contention 2: Concealed firearms easily find their way into the hands of convicted felons. Most would not have a problem with law-abiding citizens owning a concealed handgun. Yet, often times, the handgun user is NOT a law-abiding citizen, but a convicted criminal regaining his/her gun rights. Several states, such as Washington and Cleveland, allow released felons to regain their gun rights as long as minimal requirements have been met. Since 1995, 3,300 convicted felons in Washington have regained their gun rights (5). 13% of these felons have engaged in further criminal activity with these firearms including first-degree murder, drive-by-shootings, and child rape. The process barring these individuals from acquiring firearms is atrocious. Aside from those felons incarcerated for first-degree murder and other such crimes, ""judges have no discretion to reject petitions"" (5) for criminals regaining their gun rights. The federal government can do little to stop this gun proliferation; due to the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the federal government must leave gun restoration policy to the states. And, as we've seen, many of them are not doing good jobs. Contention 3: Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense As this contention clashes directly with my opponent""s first contention, this suffices to rebut his argument. First, we must realize guns are rarely used for self-defense. The NRA claims guns have been used to stop approximately 2.5 million crimes a year; analysis by the National Crime Victimization survey actually finds handguns are used for self-defense a mere 67,470 a year. In 2010 alone, there were 8,275 firearms based homicides, as compared to 230 justifiable self-defense homicides (6). My opponent brings up an alleged deterrent effect, as ""criminals never know who is armed."" There are a few problems with this analysis. First off, an exposed firearm is far more intimidating than a concealed one. If anyone saw someone with a Glock strapped to his/her ankle, they would likely stay away. Second, this analysis assumes every criminal will make the logical step, assuming anyone might have a gun. This is far from likely. If a criminal is mentally ill, he is not likely to take this logical step. The same applies to a criminal addicted to malevolent substances, such as PCP. This also ignores criminal desperation; if a criminal needs the money to satisfy a drug addiction, or even to put bread on the table, he will disregard the possibility of any random person having a gun. Finally, my opponent cites the research of Dr. John Lott, a ""shall-issue"" law enthusiast whose research is often cited by pro-gun advocates. Yet there are flaws in Lott""s analysis as well. We must consider the possibility of a conflict of interest, as Lott""s research was funded by the Olin Foundation, a subsidiary of the Olin Corporation, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the country. Secondly, Lott based his theories on econometric data points, rather than psychological data taken from case studies, surveys, and experiments with criminals; the latter data is far more compelling. Even if we look at the study itself, a revised data set of Lott""s study indicated the effect of ""right-to-carry laws"" had no statistical significance (7) on violent crime. Thus, this change was due to factors beyond the controls established by Lott""s analysis. Finally, concealed handguns have limited stopping power and poor accuracy in the hands of an untrained marksman. The entry and exit wound on handguns is smaller than for other weapons. Most don""t have a scope.. Even gun advocate Chris Bird notes a handgun is ""the least effective fire-arm for self-defense"" (8). Since these weapons are so rarely used for self-defense, rarely deter criminals, and are poor self-defense items in the first place, right to carry laws are not the best way to promote public safety. With this in mind, I would like to refute my opponent""s other argument, his second contention; Pro Contention 2: The public isn't ready to handle gun responsibility. I will keep this refutation brief for sake of clash in other rounds, but the main issue with my opponent's argument is a false correlation. Not only does correlation not assume causation, but the statistics my opponent asserts may not even have to deal with gun responsibility. The statistics only suggest people are less likely to be arrested for violent crime. This does not mean people are ""better"" or ""more responsible."" Dozens of other factors come into play. The recent economic crisis (thus limiting funds to purchase guns), the possibility of increased law enforcement, or decreases in drug abuse could all be responsible for this trend. The confounding variables severely hamper the validity of these statistics. With that, I close the first round. Thank you, and good luck. 1. http://www.vpc.org... 2. http://www.vpc.org... 3. http://www.bjs.gov... 4. http://www.armalite.com... 5. http://www.nytimes.com... 6. http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com... 7. http://www.nap.edu... 8. http://www.nap.edu..."

Sbe1c3672-A48963fe5	Right to carry arms	"In this second Con speech, I will examine the arguments in Pro""s second speech, demonstrating why they are not as powerful as my opponent believes. I must note my opponent never defended his own arguments. This significant drop should be considered by the voters. All of the arguments put forth against his second contention, namely that of correlation v. causation, still apply. Now, let us examine his rebuttals to Side Con""s contentions in full. C1: Concealed firearm use leads to lethal violent crime. My opponent first clashes with my critique of NRA reports of self-defense using firearms. He correctly claims this point has nothing to do with Side Pro's argument. The purpose of said paragraph was giving context to the political environment, not to add a false source to side Pro - mere stylistic flair. That being said, Side Pro then produces evidence from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Apparently, there were no murder convictions for Texas permit holders in 1999. My opponent has selectively chosen this number. In that same year (1), CHL holders were found guilty of 4 charges of aggressive assault with a deadly weapon, 1 case of sexual assault, 53 cases of assault causing bodily injury, 15 cases of deadly conduct, 5 terrorism threats, and 34 cases of unlawful carrying of arms. Furthermore, my opponent only looked at statistics from 1999. Considering more recent statistics, namely 2011, there were not only murder convictions, but manslaughter, robbery, child sexual abuse, and multi-murder convictions for CHL holders. There were four murders by CHL holders in 2010 alone. A full swath of CHL holder crimes can be found here (2). My opponent also asserts ""Florida statistics show only 18 crimes involving firearms by license holders, out of 221,443 licenses issued between October 1987 and April 1994."" This claim only looks at a time period far prior to a more modern, nuanced view of gun proliferation in Florida. Namely, prior to 2005, Florida""s firearm-involved murder rate never topped 3.5 people per 100,000. Since 2005, the number of murders has been higher. In 2011, 70% of all Florida murders involved handguns. Equally alarming is this fact: though Florida has the most concealed gun permits of any state, it still has the 13th highest firearm-involved murder rate in the state (3). Deterrent? The numbers disagree. Later, in support of his first contention, my opponent brings up a quote by David Burnett: ""We have 153 documented cases across 26 states with at least 550 lives saved."" At first, this 550 seems 34 lives higher than the 516 killed by CHL holders. Pro seems to win, but the numbers don""t match up. Burnett""s research was not confined solely to concealed carry self-defense instances, but ALL self-defense instances in the 153 documented cases. Thus, comparing this number to the 516 is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Under this comparison, Pro""s self-defense number pales to the total number of ALL handgun murders, including concealed carry murders, a whopping 8,275 in 2010 alone. Burnett's figures for purely concealed carry safety measures are undoubtedly smaller. When the 516 concealed carry murders nearly equal the same number of total self-defense instances found in 26 states, we have a problem. Finally, my opponent claims my statistics involving all handgun deaths are invalid and irrelevant. I profoundly disagree. The resolution states we have a ""right to carry a concealed handgun"" (Pro 1). If that is the case, we must consider the possibility if every person in the US decided to take up that right; otherwise, we would be adopting the resolution without looking through all possibilities, a prospect my opponent fears. Thus, when we look at the total number of handgun murders, we see how the US population tends to use semi-automatic handguns. Sadly for Pro, criminals are the guns"" primary users, as outlined in my first speech. Thus, all points brought up against my 1C have been refuted. 2C: Concealed firearms easily find themselves into the hands of convicted felons. First, allow me to elaborate upon this point. Giving a gun to a convicted felon, especially one convicted of violent crime, is tantamount to giving a cocaine addict cocaine upon his becoming sober. It makes no logical sense, giving the criminal the ability to engage in crime yet again. My opponent correctly asserts I wish guns to prevent convicted felons from acquiring guns. However, he counters on two fronts. For one thing, he claims most will find illegal ways to regain guns. While illegal options are certainly viable, this does not make a legal option for them to obtain firearms any less immoral. Such an option still puts weapons in the hands of convicted felons, who, as my first speech demonstrates, do commit violent crimes. Since the legal option does not decrease the number of crimes these felons commit or the number of illegal arms purchased, it only serves as a detriment to the general public. My opponent""s second counter-argument is even more interesting. ""If all convicted felons were restricted from obtaining a gun, there would be around 1.8 MILLION people who committed small crimes but were not able to obtain guns legally. That""s almost the state population of Nebraska!!"" My response: why not? So what if 1.8 million people cannot legally own a gun? I thought the fewer guns you have, the fewer murders you have! After all, if Australia has shown us anything, limiting the number of guns available to the population has lowered the number of gun murders to mere triple digits (4) as opposed to the US""s quintuple digits (5)! Since my opponent has failed to demonstrate why preventing these felons from having their gun rights is wrong, this entire counterargument remains utterly unconvincing. Preventing 1.8 million convicted felons from acquiring guns is a huge boon to public safety. Thus, with both arguments countered, my 2C stands. 3C: Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense. My opponent counters this in two ways. First, he claims the deterrent effect of ""shall-issue laws"" is very much real, due to statistics in Florida gun violence. Sadly, my opponent utterly ignores the argument I previously put forth: correlation does NOT equal causation. Hundreds of factors "" economics, politics, racism, education "" affect the reduction in violent crime. Furthermore, the drop in violent crime occurred from 2007 to 2011. Since Florida""s ""shall-issue laws"" came into effect in 1987 (6), why didn""t this drop in crime happen earlier? Secondly, my opponent attacks a world I promoted in my 3C, where people must reveal their firearms on their person. My opponent believes people could be frightened of innocent civilians. This would be true, but this is not as important as the greater deterrent effect. For an instant, voters, put yourselves in the criminal""s shoes. Who would you rather rob? A. An older woman walking down the street who MIGHT have a gun. B. An older woman walking down the street who visibly HAS a gun. My opponent also claims this would also make the US a ""terrorist country."" This is false; having a firearm exposed does not make you a terrorist or the US a terrorist country. Soldiers and police officers often have highly visible firearms; they are not terrorists. Such a world is far from IDEAL (a world with NO guns), it certainly deters more crime than the world Pro supports. Unless side Pro can adequately respond to all these arguments, along with those not addressed earlier in the round, Side Con must win this debate.

Sbe1c3672-A3cfd5e72	Right to carry arms	"As Pro, I wish to start by contesting Con""s first argument "" Concealed firearms lead to lethal violent crime "" 1) My opponent starts his first argument by saying that the NRA loves to tell stories about concealed handguns to say they have saved lives. However, the information I give is not produced by the NRA, but by the Texas Department of Public Safety & Florida state records. The Texas Department of Public Safety released a study in 1999 that showed that in that year the rate of murder convictions for permit holders in Texas was zero percent. There were NONE. Florida statistics show only 18 crimes involving firearms by license holders, out of 221,443 licenses issued between October 1987 and April 1994. 2) My opponent then gives an example of a killing by a citizen with a concealed firearm, which is followed by the fact that 516 people have been killed this way. This may be true, but according to a study by criminologist Gary Kleck of Florida State University, there are approximately 2.5 million cases of people using firearms for self-defense in America each year. However, this study was disproved and it was shown that he was greatly exaggerating. I tell you this to confirm the authenticity of the information I am about to give you. Another study from the same period, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), estimated almost 70,000 defensive gun uses annually. ""We have 153 documented cases across 26 states with at least 550 lives saved"", says David Burnett, who tracks incidents of defensive gun use. This shows the difference between the lives saved and the lives lost are definitely in favor of saved. 3) My opponent then says that we have an alarming amount of deaths from handgun usage. This point says nothing against the negativities of concealed carry, those are figures related to handguns in general. Therefore his argument is invalid. Next, I wish to put forth my second point - Citizens should have the same advantages as the criminals who attack them. Since this point clashes with my opponent""s second point, I will rebut it in this way. According to my opponent""s argument, convicted felons are also allowed to regain gun rights, and therefore this becomes a danger to the rest of the population. So, ideally, my opponent wishes guns to be banned from convicted felons. 1)Firstly, most criminals would not bother to get a concealed carry gun permit. There are many ways for criminals to get guns without obtaining a permit. 2)Secondly, this idea for guns to be banned from all convicted felons can be put down another way - in the US, as of 2010, there were a little more than 2.3 million convicted felons. Out of those, 700,000 were for violent offenses. Out of these, 400,000 commit crimes for the second time. If all convicted felons were restricted from obtaining a gun, there would be around 1.8 MILLION people who committed small crimes but were not able to obtain guns legally. That""s almost the state population of Nebraska!! In my opponent""s third argument, he discredits the ""alleged"" deterrent effect and proceeds to advise that the guns should be exposed instead of concealed. There are 2 flaws in my opponent""s reasoning. Firstly, the ""alleged"" deterrent effect, as my opponent calls it, has reduced crime all over the country. For example, the report from ABC News shows that in Florida, where there are more concealed weapons permits than anywhere else in the country, violent crime has dropped to the lowest point in history. Firearm-related violent crimes in Florida have dropped by one-third in just four years, 2007 to 2011. I don""t think it can still be called the ""alleged"" deterrent effect. It is real, and it definitely works. My opponent""s second flaw is that if guns were allowed to be exposed, people wouldn't""t be warned of criminals coming their way, as he could be an innocent civilian as well. Also, think of the effect it would have on our nation. The United States of America is not a terrorist country, for people to be walking around with, and I quote my opponent, ""with a Glock strapped to his/her ankle"". The government considers all these effects before putting a law into place, and I think my opponent should too. With that, I close my argument for the second round."	PRO	9
S45d4a2d5-A6ced3097	Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime	"I thank my opponent for creating this debate. First off, my opponent offers a definition of right to carry: ""mean the ability to have a concealed firearm on said persons in public areas."" I concede to this definition and would like to have it now noted that the affirmation has to abide in this definition in evidence and arguements. Example of Campus allowing concealed carry, and then not allowing concealed carry. Board Chairman Patrick McConathy explained the board's decision to disarm all law abiding adults on campus by stating that the ""members of the CSU system board believe this is a reasonable, rational and responsible decision for our system."" The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators agreed, stating ""there is no credible statistical evidence demonstrating that laws allowing the carrying of concealed firearms reduce crime."" My opponent suggests that if, in referrence to the Columbine Shooting, people were armed there could have been a halt to the shootings. We actually do not know this. In an experiment by 20/20, selected students from a college were chosen to take part. The students, varying from age, fire-arm training, and ethnicity were given a pistol loaded with paintballs and told to sit in a lecture hall with other students listening to a class session. (Note, one at a time these students were tested). The subjects were told that they would need to use a gun to defend themselves, but not when. When the attackers barged through the door, none of the subjects could kill or even down the intruder before being shot and killed. This experiment suggests that even if people were armed at the Columbine Shooting, they could never recieve the training needed to act accordingly in a life or death situation. My opponent mentions earlier that I neglected that he stated, ""with correct instruction"". However, as I have shown, one can never fully prepare themselves in life or death cases such as this. Even then, you can't expect the instructee to pay full attention. Example, driver liscenses. Teenagers are required to take a test and go through training, but why do teenagers make up the most of the car crashes that are reported in the United States? Because you can not fully know what the intentions are of a person when they want to get something. My opponent provides this as evidence. ""Florida enacted a right to carry law in 1987, these are the statistics of crimes rates in Florida to the rest of United States from 1987 to 1997 Homicide rate dropped 36% in Florida and went down .4% as United states as a whole. Firearm Homicide rate dropped 37% and went up 15% as a nation. Handgun Homicide rate dropped 41 & and went up 24% as a nation. 1998 NRA Fact Card."" Viewed in January of 1999 on the National Rifle Association web site, http://www.nra.org...; I would like to ask first off, is this a concealed carry law? I can't affirm that because the source my opponent provided is blocked on my webbrowser. Second off, in order for this to work in favor of my opponents case, it must be assumed that every number in this piece of evidence is in direct correllation with the Right to Carry Law enacted by Florida in 1987. With that aside, notice these pieces of statistics that contradict my opponents case: ""Firearm Homicide rate dropped 37% and went up 15% as a nation. Handgun Homicide rate dropped 41 & and went up 24% as a nation."" As a result of the Right to Carry Law, Firearm Homicide went up 15% as a nation? Handgun Homicide up 24%? The increase of homicides in these areas, which relate to the resolution, show that because of this Law, homicides went up. The increase of homicides in 49 states, far outweighs the decrease in 1. ""If you believe that giving a gun to some one to carry might cause crime rates to go up then, from 1987 to 1999 221443 right to carry permits where given out, out of those 220000 plus people only 18 crimes where committed by these persons."" (Lott, John R. Jr. and Mustard, David B. ""Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns."" University of Chicago School of Law, 7/26/96.) I would like to note that there is a fallacy within this piece of evidence listed above. If this evidence came from the source posted after it, then it is not credible. The book was written in 7/26/96, so the year 1996. The evidence notes that it incorporates statistics from 1987 to 1999. Because this is an obvious contradiction, unless I am mistaken, this piece of evidence is not credible and can not be used. I will now state my opinion. It is the job of the government to protect our rights. To protect our natural rights. How is this justified if the government allows all of the nation to carry weapons? How safe will our society feel then? It is the obligation of the people to give up a portion of their freedom so that they can have the government protect their rights. Examples of this are the United States Navy, Army, Airforce, State Police, and County Police. By advocating for concealed weapon carry, one is saying that the government is not doing their job in protecting the rights of America. What would the need of a sheriff be, if every person in town carried a weapon. It would not turn our country into a safe haven. Likewise, concealed carry laws would create tension among everyone. My opponent advocates concealed carry. It can be the will of the negation to propose a better fitting solution. Since concealed carry is extremely unreasonable, I advocate for the allowing of weapons to be allowed in houses, but not concealed carry. I believe that in this respect, no one feels tension of being shot in public, because the guns are in the houses. I believe that this is a more suitable explanation of how it can reduce crime better than concealed carry. =Experiment= 20/20 provided another experiment. They sent one of their correspondents into a gun show, with no gun liscence and a set budget. Within a few hours, the man had purchased several firearms, without ever being asked for his liscence. This shows that if someone wanted a gun, they could get a gun. Concealed carry will inevitably create a negative effect and cause tension among people, it will also allow people with hurtful intentions to easily aquire a firearm. I understand that I have not posted any sources, aside from 20/20. That is because my computer has blocked every website that has to do with guns. I have disproved one of my opponents sources, which should hurt his credibility somewhat. For these reasons and many others, I still stand in firm negation of the resolution."	CON	10
Sbe1c3672-Abb6cc55f	Right to carry arms	"As my opponent forfeited the previous round, the final round of debate, it is my job to formally end this debate. Since this is the final speech of the round, I would like to condense all the issues in this debate into two central questions. 1. Do concealed handguns deter criminals from crime? 2. Do concealed handguns save more people than they kill? On Side Con, I proudly believe the answer to both questions is NO; Side Con has a clear COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE on both of these issues. With that in mind, let""s examine the first question: 1. Do concealed handguns deter criminals from crime? As my opponent brought up in his first speech, ""Criminals are less likely to attack someone that they believe might be armed."" The logic is simple: ""if anyone could have a gun, then I shouldn""t attack anyone for fear he/she might pull a gun on me."" The Instigator then defended this point with studies from Dr. John Lott. Yet, as we saw in my previous two speeches, my opponent""s logic does not hold up. First and foremost, Dr. John Lott""s studies have been found invalid due to a lack of statistical significance. The findings he had could have just as easily arisen from pure luck due to a large number of confounding variables in his study. The controversy behind the funding of his research is only a cherry on top. Furthermore, my opponent did not adequately respond to arguments put forth in the 1st and 2nd Con speech: openly shown firearms are a far more effective deterrent. Once again, whom would you rather rob? The old lady who might have a gun or the old lady who has a gun? The answer is clear. My opponent also ignores the psychological elements of crime, such as criminal desperation and drug addiction. Many won""t make the logical leaps my opponent assumes they will. The conclusion is simple. In a shall-issue law world, there will still be muggings, rapes, and murders. There are better, safer alternatives to this scenario my opponent failed to refute. With this in mind, we can safely say the answer to this first question is NO, favoring Side Con. 2. Do concealed handguns save more people than they kill? There has been a slight back-and-forth over this issue over the course of debate. Yet, looking over the previous two speeches, Con definitively emerged triumphant. The comparisons Side Pro made in Round 2 between the VPC and David Burnett were not ""apples-to-apples"" comparisons, as noted in Side Con""s Round 2 speech. To this day, individuals with legal concealed weapons permits kill citizens across the country. Such records are often incomplete, as not all crimes are reported. People such as Philip Davis have no chance to flee, giving the ease of use of a concealed handgun. My opponent claims ""citizens should have the same advantages as the criminals who attack them."" While, ideally, neither the criminal nor the average citizen should have a gun in the first place, a concealed weapons permit makes it far easier to kill a person with malicious intent than to defend oneself from an attacker. As discussed in Con""s Round 1 speech, the most common concealed handguns, namely the 9mm, are horrendous for self-defense. While they are rapid fire, the stopping power is minimal, especially when put in the hands of an untrained marksman. A criminal, on the other hand, is more likely to use the handgun as a threat, holding someone up for valuables. Or, if murder is the design, the criminal is far more likely to have practiced using the gun than the everyday citizen. These handguns are far more practical as murder weapons than self-defense. This point was not questioned at ALL by Side Pro. Side Pro also failed to properly refute Con""s second contention: convicted felons do regain their gun rights, and do kill again. In Washington ALONE, 429 felons have engaged in crime after regaining their gun rights, using their weapons as either leverage or as murder weapons. Even if denying these people of their gun rights would prevent practically the population of Nebraska from owning concealed handguns, this is still a step towards the safety of the American citizenry. If we look at the deaths and the nature of concealed firearms, we overwhelmingly find the answer to the second question is NO. Thus, who has the comparative advantage? Side Con. Side Pro may like the theory behind ""shall-issue"" laws, but, in practice, these laws have not markedly improved pubic safety. If anything, they make our world LESS safe. As Side Con has repeatedly shown you, voters, concealed firearms should be illegal for US private citizens. So, for the good of restricting gun proliferation, vote Con. For the safety of the American people, vote Con. For the family of Philip Davis, vote Con. Thank you."	CON	11
S45d4a2d5-A312da231	Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime	"Thank you for accepting this debate. I will start my this round by saying that obtaining a firearm is different in every state, it would be unwise to assume that the gun control laws are the same for every state. For instance, in Illinois you must be 18, to legally purchase a long gun (any gun with a barrel longer than 12 inches), and 21 to purchase a pistol. You must also have a FOID (Firearm Owner Identification) card, obtaining a FOID card requires an application to the IL state police where they perform a back ground check, after you have a FOID car you must wait 24 hours after purchasing a gun to pick it up. Logic would presume that this is not an easy way to obtain a firearm. Granted my opening statement was short and open to debate on the argument it would ensue, right to carry has nothing to do with obtaining firearms, that is not what is discussion is about. It is about whether or not right to carry reduces crim my opponent provided no evidence that people who own fire arms that carry them in on them would not reduce crime. Has I am now realizing this being my first debate I should have defined Right to carry, but I believe my opponent to mistaken in his definition, Right to carry mean the ability to have a concealed firearm on said persons in public areas. Housing firearms is merely owning firearms, and due to the fact that in 1993 49% of homes had at least one firearm in them (Study: ""Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun."" By Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (Northwestern University School of Law), 1995. Accessed at http://www.saf.org....) I do not believe that 13 year old are the main issue when it comes to Right to carry. My opponent also neglected the fact that I stated ""with correct instruction"", I do not have enough time to provide detailed information about gun safety this link should be detailed enough (http://www.nrahq.org...). As for the columbine school shooting, those firearms where obtained by adults and given to young adults who had the intent to cause arm to people, if some one is that determined to cause harm, will have a gun really stop them. Think of any public shooting, however sad they are, could each one have not been stopped if a trained person carried a firearm, could many of lives have not been saved? The argument could be made that couldn't the lives be saved if guns where band, and I would like the audience know that this is not the issue at hand. If my opponent would like to argue that I would be more than happy to right after this. My opponent asked for evidence that crime would actually be reduced well Florida enacted a right to carry law in 1987, these are the statistics of crimes rates in Florida to the rest of United States from 1987 to 1997 Homicide rate dropped 36% in Florida and went down .4% as United states as a whole.

S9f12e0e6-A9f4de430	Adults, without violence related felonies, should have the right to carry a concealed firearm.	There are an infinite amount of scenarios that could go wrong. Just because something can go wrong does not mean that it will. You can not say that something should not happen simply because it could go wrong, unless there is proof that it will go wrong more times than not, which is not the case. 30-34% (70-80 million people) of adult Americans in the USA admitted to owning and regularly carrying a gun at some point. 4,346 murders were committed with a legally owned firearm in 2010. .0054% of the murders were committed by legal gun owners That is not anywhere close to a problem. That is like saying gasoline should be controlled and only kept available to certain qualified people because there are arsonists that will uses the gasoline to start fires potentially killing people. Qualified citizens having guns is not just a right but the opposite of a problem. Taking away the right to keep and bear arms will only cause more crimes to be committed. People will start illegally importing guns at much more of a vast rate and continue selling them to everyone including murderers or people who should not own guns. Statistics show that when gun control is implemented violent crimes increase. Example: Washington DC Sources: http://gunvictimsaction.org... http://www.justfacts.com...	PRO	13
S45d4a2d5-A7f89ccd4	Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime	"I would like to begin by clarifying three issues within this debate, no matter how important they are. (1) If you believe that giving a gun to some one to carry might cause crime rates to go up then, from 1987 to 1999 221443 right to carry permits where given out, out of those 220000 plus people only 18 crimes where committed by these persons. (Lott, John R. Jr. and Mustard, David B. ""Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns."" University of Chicago School of Law, 7/26/96.) Posted by my opponent. At first notice this suggests that it is a statistic of the nation of the United States. But to clarify, it only deals with Florida, ""* 221,443 concealed carry licenses were issued in Florida between October of 1987 and April of 1994. During that time, Florida recorded 18 crimes committed by licensees with firearms. "" http://www.justfacts.com... Notice that it also seems that my opponent has altered the statistic, stating from 1987 to 1999. But when the actual evidence is looked at from its source you can see that it says 1987 to 1994. My opponent states that it could have possible been a human error, but we can't know for sure. (2) ""Also what my opponent either doesn't know who has not acknowledged yet is that by me arguing for conceal and carry in all 50 states I am really only arguing for conceal and carry to be legal in Illinois and Wisconsin, because those are the only two states in the entire United States that do not have some form of conceal carry."" My opponent must be referring to the map shown below in the link. http://www.wmsa.net... However, this map states that there are 65.7% of the US population lives in ""Right To Carry"" (Vermont, Alaska & 37 ""Shall Issue"") states, 28.1% in ""Right Restricted"" (9 ""May Issue"") states, and 6.3% in ""Right Denied"" (2) states. This means that 11 states may or can't issue right to carry laws. That means he is also arguing for these 11 states. I believe that my opponent has also not given examples of why these specific states would benefit. I have provided enough evidence to at least discredit my opponents source about Florida and shown that it can also be used both ways. (3) ""If a trained police officer barges into a room, knowing exactly where the ""test subjects"" where seating there would be little anyone could do. How do I know this, well if you watch the case study you see that the trained police officer goes into room gun drawn and goes after no one else but the ""test subject"". It would also be very hard to defend yourself if you where wearing baggy pants and do not have you firearm in a holster like logic would presume for just such situation, I forgot to mention the over sized white tee-shirt you are wearing."" My opponent has correctly identified the experiment I have cited. However, the test subject was not the first fired at; in fact, he had ample time to unholster his weapon and fire the weapon. The attacker was trained (for safety reasons of course) and fired first at the lecturer of the class, then took a while to spot the person in the crowd with the weapon. As for clothing, you can't expect every kid in the room with a concealed weapon to wear his shirt tucked in and have ""non-baggy"" pants. As for a side note, a couple of the test subjects actually missed the attacker when shooting and hit one of the people running out the door behind him. This shows that, just like a police officer, you need years of training to become accurate enough to shoot at someone that is standing in front of a crowd of people. So, after clarifying this aspect, it is safe to assume that this experiment accurately portrayed what would happen if concealed carry was allowed in colleges. =General Refutations to my Opponents Arguements= ((1)) My opponent mentions that I have not provided any evidence showing that teenage drivers are the leading factor of car accidents. Well here, ""Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. "" Along with more evidence to support this claim. http://www.rmiia.org... ((2)) As for the controversy over Florida. I did not specifically say that the statistic does not help your case. I implied that it could also be turned around and used for mine. He states that if everyone had Florida's same laws on concealed weapons, what would suggest that Homicide rates would continue to increase throughout the nation. However, my opponent has said that the laws of all states regarding concealed carry vary greatly. He condradicts himself and tries to create a theory that all states will have the same law, and therefore homicide rates will decrease, but as he has already stated, ""but it is very hard to tell difference between the to due to the fact that everystate has different firearm laws"" As a side note, I believe my spelling and grammar constitutes a point for me. Had to state that somewhere. ((3)) I have also shown that my opponent may have altered evidence, to which he replied, """"As for my ""falsified facts"", I would like to suggest the human error of typo"""". This is a very vague rebuttal to something to which he simply could of said, ""I made a mistake"". Instead he wishes to suggest that he did it, but does not take a stand. ((4)) I brought up my opinion of why concealed carry was wrong. My opinion no needed facts. I had expected to hear some of my opponents opinion. Instead he insists on copying and pasting evidence from other sites and draws blatant conclusions on them. He states, ""My opponent states that it is the job of the government to protect our rights, but what about our lives?"" I believe the natural rights of every citizen still stands to be the Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. So to answer your question, I meant all three of these when mentioning rights of citizens of a government. I would like to ask some rhetorical questions which will hopefully have an impact on the readers judging decision. ;) Is it not one of the foundations of our government to uphold and protect it's citizens rights? Is it not the job of the State police and County police to serve and protect us as a people? Don't these State police and County police have years of experience which allow them to become one of our protectors? Why should we then, pass on the job of a professional policeman, to each citizen's of the United States? Why allow the use of a life or death weapon, to be placed within a human's hands which is capable of destroying lives? The answer is, we shouldn't. Because I have provided thoughtful insight and evidence to support my side of the resolution, I urge a negative vote."	CON	14
S9f12e0e6-A79835184	Adults, without violence related felonies, should have the right to carry a concealed firearm.	Honestly you really can't compare gasoline to a firearm. For an arsonist it takes a longer time to kill someone, but for a murderer it's just hit and boom the person's seriously injured or dead. Plus to be an arsonist you have to place the gasoline, which plenty of people can see them while they do it. The fact that we can't prove that something will or will not happen, scares people. When people are scared or worried, we do what seems right and to people, banning firearms is the right thing to do. Washington DC is where the president lives, not everyone likes the president. Which can lead to higher violent crimes, people trying to kill the president, people just showing their hatred, and etc. The .0054% of murderers that were committed by legal gun owners, is a problem. People still have to watch their backs where ever they go, they have to wonder: Does that guy have a gun I can't see? Will he kill people? What if he does? It is a huge problem!	CON	15
S4e7c66b5-Af741a603	In order to solve school/campus shootings, we should allow more people to carry guns	"The dictionary define ""vigilante"" as ""a member of a self-appointed group of citizens who undertake law enforcement in their community without legal authority, typically because the legal agencies are thought to be inadequate"". My opponent states that he was not eluding to arming people with more guns, but someone trained.... see his comment: ""Who I do say should be in the room with a gun is a trained individual of either in law enforcement, or someone trained to handle the job. Either that or allowing an adult to be able to carry a concealed handgun."". Or maybe his comment at the end..........""or allowing an adult to be able to carry a concealed handgun"". For what purpose? To protect himself, or others. Vigilante as defined by the dictionary, is exactly applicable. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this debate. People feel the protection is inadequate and want to protect themselves and others in a way they see fit. To make this debate fun, I offer a well thought out article called"" Batman and the Problem With Vigilante Justice: A Love Story"" http://the-artifice.com...; Dont' all spiritual warriors have a little batman inside of them? After all, guns represent power. And Batman is POWERFul. Probem is, its a comic strip. The article contends that : ""Batman is a character that takes matters into his own hands. He does not wait for approval and effectively answers to no one. When a problem arises, he rises to the occasion and remedies the situation, often times to the chagrin of the local authorities. Lastly, and most importantly, Batman is problematic to the government because he gives the people back their power. The citizens of Gotham feel as if they have been completely stripped of all of their power, of their voice, to stand up against the injustices committed against them both by criminals and the government itself. Batman’s public display of vigilante justice provides an outlet for the public to understand that they do not have to hide in the shadows and feel as if they are perpetual victims of an impotent system that fails to protect them"". I offer to my opponent that there are many statistics about gun deaths, shootings, etc - none of which are more credicble than the next. So I will purposefully, not reply to his cited statiistics. We can go back and forth all day about who's stats are right. Isn't that what the people are doing now? It's getting us no where in terms of progressive solutions to move us forward. Everyone has natural fear. But our fear is growing daily, as each massacare and world political war stage becomes more and more violent. Kids, and teens, angry because they don't have a girlfriend (Oregon shooter ""I will die a virgin and without a girlfriend"", (http://www.dailymail.co.uk...). Children die, and adults respond with ""more guns!"". What the heck? These are reactions of emotional people driven by frustration and hate for something, someone, somewhere. No well-adjusted person is filled with rage and unaffected by the loss of human life (at least seemingly so by either failure to address it, or give it much relevance).

Once more, guns are there; but not the source for all deaths. Then my opponent quotes: ""It is much easier to view these as remote incidents if you have not been affected. I have not, personally, but numbers are increasing at alarming rates"". First off, I like to point out one thing voters that my opponent made a claim, without any evidence. If my opponent supported this claim with evidence, then he would have something; but does not. For the portion of crime increasing at alarming rates, I will agree its happening, but not because of guns; more so the Media. Haven't you noticed that any time a ""major"" incident has occured the media always puts an emphasis on the criminal instead of the victim. This activitates the effect of ""The Agents of Socialization"" that influences a criminal to do a similar crime, because of the criminal portrayed in the media. This gives the new criminal the thought process of ""Hey, I can get my fifteen minutes of fame for commiting a crime"". (2) In my opinion, if we were to put blame on the raising on crime rates; it wouldn't be the guns but more so the media. To even further extend on why guns cannot be the issue, I like to point to a fact about gun control laws. Stated in the book ""More Guns, Less Crime"", John R. Lott Jr. states: ""States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes. Thirty-one states now have such laws—called “shall-issue” laws. These laws allow adults the right to carry concealed handguns if they do not have a criminal record or a history of significant mental illness"" (3). Funny enough, the more gun control laws; the more chances of crime to ensue. This effect is what I call ""Reverse Psychology"". If we go with this statistic, it seems that the more free people are wih guns, the less amount of crime will happen. Then my opponent quotes: ""Vigilantes are noble. Full of passion to protect, and full of fire to ""right a wrong"". But they are not trained, and can cause more damage than good"". In the previous argument, I mentioned about having a trained individual being within the school just in case another incident happened like this again. My opponent makes the assumption that I was referring to a vigilante, which I like to point out is wrong. In my previous argument, I did not even mention anything about a vigilante being the individual in the room with a gun. Who I do say should be in the room with a gun is a trained individual of either in law enforcement, or someone trained to handle the job. Either that or allowing an adult to be able to carry a concealed handgun. Then my opponent states: ""Kids and college students are in danger and the first reaction is to worry about gun rights and the 2nd amendment"". Actually, yes; we should worry about the 2nd Amendement because we used guns to make this country. If we didn't, we would no longer be a country of democracy. This whole debate revolves the second amendement, and my opponent is claiming that we shouldn't focus on this? We should because if we are tring to protect victims of future shootings, the right to bare arms is a necessity for our survival. Have times changed, yes; but that doesn't mean we get rid of the second amendement completely. Do people get shot, yes they do; however, it wasn't the guns fault but the person holding the gun. Guns don't kill people, people kill people; guns are just a more convinient way of getting the job done, like throwing a rock on someones head.

S45d4a2d5-A8ea26f94	Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime	"I would like to thank-you my opponent for allowing me to debate with him or her, as this is my first serious debate. I would like to point out before I begin that it is the burden of the PRO to prove that ALL 50 fifty states should be allowed to carry a firearm and that by doing this, crime will effectively be reduce. Because my opponent has not provided any definitions for his or her debate it is safe to assume that the definitions I post in ROUND 1 will thereafter will referred to as the definitions of the debate. Definitions: 50 states: Implied by the PRO to be the United States of America. Right to carry a firearm: Commonly referred to as each individual allowed the right to carry or house a firearm. Firearm: A small arms weapon, such as a pistol or rifle. Crime: An action or an instance of negligence that is deemed injurious to the public welfare or morals or to the interests of the state and that is legally prohibited. I would like to begin by refuting my opponents case. (1)I believe that the right to carry, reduces crime rates and should be made legal in all 50 states, with limitations to who would be able to carry a firearm of U.S citizens above the age of 21 and no prior felonies, or crimes with a firearm. First off, this does not support the resolution in any way. There is no evidence backing up his position. However, this is just a brief roadmap of my opponents contention. I will point out that U.S. citizens could easily receive guns. Once the gun is bought, there is no concrete way of tracking the gun. Making it easy for lets say, a person above the age of 21 and no prior felonies, or crimes, to purchase firearms and supply other people. I will save my arguement about decreasing crime rate for later. (2)""I would also argue that with correct instructions firearms can be very safe and recreational activities."" The fact of the matter is, a knowledgable thirteen-year-old can find his or her parent's firearm and easily turn off the safety mechanism and inflict damage upon themself or others. As seen in the Columbia School Shooting, it is already too easy for children to get guns if they wanted. Now with every household in the 50 states carrying a firearm, as my opponent is advocating, it will be even easier. Because my opponent has provided a small paragraph of information I will stop here. It is key to remember that my opponent must effectively support the claim that ALL 50 states be allowed to carry firearms because it reduces crime. I have not posted any sources yet, as I am allowing my opponent to first and because I am running out of personal time for this. Thank you for this debate."	CON	18

S45d4a2d5-A771b0b62	Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime	"I would like to start this round by stating that there are a few things I would agree with my opponent. If a trained police officer barges into a room, knowing exactly where the ""test subjects"" where seating there would be little anyone could do. How do I know this, well if you watch the case study you see that the trained police officer goes into room gun drawn and goes after no one else but the ""test subject"". It would also be very hard to defend yourself if you where wearing baggy pants and do not have you firearm in a holster like logic would presume for just such situation, I forgot to mention the over sized white tee-shirt you are wearing. That case study stacked the odds in favor of the attackers, there was noting anyone could do in such a biased situation. My opponent compares teenage drivers to conceal and carry permit holders, this argument should be refuted because A. provides no evidence that teenagers have highest percent of car wreaks due to lack of paying attention, couldn't it be because they are the least experienced drivers? As for my opponent say my statistics on Florida do not help my case, explain to me how Florida in 1987 homicide rates dropping as a whole does not help my point? Yes they went up as a country but what if the rest of the country did not share the same laws that Florida did, how is it proven that the country as a whole homicide rates would drop. They certainly did not go up in Florida which is on of my opponent's arguments for what could happen. My opponent states that it is the job of the government to protect our rights, but what about our lives? They also state that by advocating conceal and carry it is saying that the government isn't doing there job. Well the Supreme Court states that ""It is well-settled fact of American law that the police have no legal duty to protect any individual citizen from crime, even if the citizen has received death threats and the police have negligently failed to provide protection."" The court case was ""TOWN OF CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO, PETITIONER v. JESSICA GONZALES"". So the Supreme Court as said that they have no legal obligation to protect the individual. So what do you do when cops just aren't around or the police believe that there is a greater cause to attend to than your life? Also what my opponent either doesn't know who has not acknowledged yet is that by me arguing for conceal and carry in all 50 states I am really only arguing for conceal and carry to be legal in Illinois and Wisconsin, because those are the only two states in the entire United States that do not have some form of conceal carry, so if he/she believes that having conceal and carry in Illinois and Wisconsin would create tension in the United States as a whole then that would be saying a lot, but if conceal and carry would create tension then would we not already be feeling it now? I have already stated that if someone wants to get a firearm they are able to get one, but yet again this has nothing to do with being able to carry a firearm. Finally if I was deranged enough to want to cause harm to innocent people with a firearm and I owned firearms in my house, how would not being able to carry them stop me. Do you really think that a minor felony is going to stop someone who wants to murder people? Actually having conceal and carry permits is one of the few ways that could stop me. As for my ""falsified facts"", I would like to suggest the human error of typo, until my opponent look up document I took this off of I don't see how he can call it false."	PRO	20

Possibly, but other things also create violence like video games and movies, but do we ban those? Guns are just an easy target to say that something causes violence, but in reality the necessity of guns is necessary. Why should we take away the 2nd Amendement, just because of a few incidents? In fact, we must use common sense that if we were to take away guns, do you think criminals will follow the rules. Because it is assumed that they won't, it is necessary to bring protection among people through the means of allowing people to bear arms. Personally, I prefer a trained concealed weapon, but would feel much safer with a trained individual with a gun in the room; than having nothing to the victim's aid."	PRO	23
Scab6587-Ac140f30b	Private Citizens should be armed in public	Introduction- a. I want to thank my opponent for this debate, and I hope all those reading it have enjoyed it as well. b. The Reductio ad Absurdum still stands as a conduct voter, and calling this out is not an attack on Con's person; it is a critique of his conduct. If calling out poor conduct wasn't acceptable than it wouldn't be a voting issue on the ballots. 2. Rebuttals- a. People kill people- i. It needs to be clarified that con never addresses that concealed handguns are legal in every state but Illinois. The irrational fear Con posits does not exist in the status quo, the only exception would be sensationalism resulting from the recent shootings in Colorado and Wisconsin. ii. The chart provided is skewed evidence. It only reflects the beliefs of Gallup's users who took the time to fill out a survey. The voters may not even be American! If this evidence is good, then asking a friend their opinion and using it as evidence fine too; we know that isn't true, don't accept the Gallup poll either. b. Guns are pretty scary i. When you negate a proposition on the grounds that something bad may happen, but have no real evidence that it will happen, you're appealing to fear. Not being wary of the consequences. I could just as easily assert that something bad may happen if you're not carrying a gun; you may get raped by some-one who weighs 200 pounds more than you and have no means to protect yourself. ii. If you accept the rape argument, I nullify all of Con's impacts. If not, than all of Con's hypothetical arguments are out the window as well. c Slippery slope fallacy i. The major premise is an assumption, the minor premise is irrelevant as ownership is guaranteed to all 18 year old American citizens who are not felons and the conclusion Isn't the case as I show several times that owning a concealed handgun is already legal in the status quo. ii. Even in this format, this point is a slippery slope fallacy. There isn't any clause within the minor premise to legitimize the argument, it's just refers to what could happen. 3. Rebuttals- a. Second Amendment Rights i. This attack is Reductio ad Absurdum, and here's why; Con could have easily argued that one does not need to carry a gun in public, but instead chocked my argument up to absurdity by comparing it to jumping off a cliff. Maintaining the constitutional right to bear arms is important, and to reject that premise without warrant is completely abusive. ii. The argument that when one doesn't practice their rights, they illegitimatize them still stands. As I've said prior there is a push for stronger gun control which naturally follows tragedies like the shootings in Colorado and Wisconsin. We can't give ground on our rights based on this sensationalist fear, and practicing the right to carry a weapon is a fantastic way to maintain them. b. Security i. I never dropped my argument on gun operation, an initial tenet of this argument in round one was the fact that gun safety classes are at an all time high. ii. Follow the initial link, read the article and you will see the author explicitly writes on gun ownership deterring crime and making communities safer. My opponent cannot put further burden on me to prove something I've already proven, especially since they never even made this argument until their previous speech. c. Legality i. If failing to attack my argument (and accordingly the concealed handgun evidence) by claiming it was redundant is legitimate, then there's not much I can say here is there. I hope the voters will use their common sense to understand this is not a legitimate refutation and vote pro. This second amendment argument served to focus on the urgency of maintaining and practicing rights, while this one served to preempt the kinds of arguments my opponent makes in his 'guns are pretty scary' argument. 5. Conclusions- a. Overall I ask for a Pro ballot for the following reasons: Backing, Consistency and Conduct.	PRO	24
Scab6587-A5a7b6977	Private Citizens should be armed in public	Introduction- a. I want to start by thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and for making such swift response! b. In this round I will do the following: I will first give a summary of the issues of debate thus far, I will refute my opponent's arguments and finally I will defend the attacks my opponent made against my case. 2. Summary of the debate thus far a. Silence is compliance; My opponent has accepted my framework and definitions, thus they are no longer issues of debate. b. Pro's current arguments are as follows: Second amendment rights, Security and Legality c. Con's current arguments are as follows: People kill people, guns are pretty scary and Slippery Slope of Ownership. 3. Refutations- a. People kill people i. Social contract theory will be in place regardless of whether or not you look at the world of the affirmative or the world of the negative[6]. Keeping this in mind, we understand that people are not going to randomly start killing others just because guns are now legal. ii. This argument makes the assumption that people are just out to kill one another; if you accept this premise then it will happen either way. This isn't a unique argument, and accordingly is a reason to vote Con. iii. Understanding that this argument is fundamentally flawed, we also understand that it's an appeal to fear[7]; a rejection of something because of a fear of what may happen. You must reject arguments which appeal to fear as they are emotional arguments without a true logical or empirical warrant. [6] bit.ly/2nxh2b [7] bit.ly/3pCqfE b. Guns are pretty scary i. This is an appeal to fear[7], plain and simple. Reject these emotional arguments. ii. Extend across my legality argument, in all but one state it is legal to carry a concealed handgun[5]; if you want to accept this argument, Con must defend that this fear exists in the status quo and is still a voting issue for Con. c. Slippery Slope of ownership i. Employing a slippery slope argument can be seen in basically every argumentative circle as a logical fallacy[8]. This is when one takes a logical syllogism that has no real warrant to it an posits it as a sincere argument. At the point there is no warrant aside from the claim, it's a fallacy. ii. I really wish I had more say here, but without a real warrant to refute I'm just going to keep saying the same thing. [8] bit.ly/ZKFKN 4. Refutations- a. Second amendment rights i. This argument served two purposes -- first, to preempt arguments of legality and second, to establish an urgency of protection of rights. The preempted purpose wasn't an issue this can be stricken from the flow, however the second argument of protecting rights is still an issue to vote on. ii. The argument of affirming rights by continuing to practice them wasn't refuted, but attacked with the logical fallacy Reductio ad Absurdum[9]. My opponent disregards my argument by comparing it to jumping off a cliff, but jumping off a cliff isn't a constitutional right that is an issue of debate here. The right to bear arms is. [9] bit.ly/3sO8a3 b. Security i. The attack here is an issue of my opponent rejecting my argument entirely under the warrant that it's irrelevant. Con claimed that my cross-application impact isn't a legitimate because the study wasn't conducted with concealed handguns; however this isn't the case as the study showed that when homes have guns the security they experience extends into their community as a deterrent for crime to happen[4]. ii. The link here is perfectly acceptable and shouldn't be rejected. c. Legality in the status quo i. Not understanding my argument isn't a sound refutation, there is not attack. ii. Extend the refutations on my second amendment argument. 5. Underview- For the most part logical fallacies don't occur by malicious nature, but by oversight and omission - Reduction ad Absurdum however is an unacceptable tactic and should not be accepted. Please let con know this through your conduct voter.	PRO	25
S4e7c66b5-A5913db5b	In order to solve school/campus shootings, we should allow more people to carry guns	"To begin, my opponent starts off his last argument about the one owning the gun being a vigilante. He defines vigilante as: ""A member of a self-appointed group of citizens who undertake law enforcement in their community without legal authority, typically because the legal agencies are thought to be inadequate"". Do I agree with this definition, yes; but does not apply to teachers or someone trained with a gun in the school. The definition clearly defines a vigilante taking ""Law Enforcement"" into their own hands, but this isn't the dealings about law enforcement; more so self defense. This makes my opponents definition of vigilante vague because it does not apply to what I am saying, and the definition itself can be very contradictory. Then my opponent, comedically, brings up his only source of evidence being a comic strip. First off, that isn't evidence to any argument just the use of an analogy. And my opponents comment even leans toward the Pro side, in which he stated: ""Dont' all spiritual warriors have a little batman inside of them? After all, guns represent power. And Batman is POWERFul. Probem is, its a comic strip"". My opponent admits that guns make people feel powerful, and if this is the case; why not help many innocent bistanduals feel powerful, instead of letting them get shot? If we follow this quote, we can make anyone powerful with a gun and will even out the playing field between the victim and criminal. Also, my opponent even admits that this evidence is not ""strong"", because he said ""Its a comic strip"". It is a comic strip, and the evidence is vague. Then my opponent states the following: ""I offer to my opponent that there are many statistics about gun deaths, shootings, etc - none of which are more credicble than the next. So I will purposefully, not reply to his cited statiistics. We can go back and forth all day about who's stats are right. Isn't that what the people are doing now? It's getting us no where in terms of progressive solutions to move us forward"". Voters, the reason I bring up this statement is because my opponent failed to post his evidence. He says that ""There are so much evidence to his argument"", yet he doesn't bring any up? How does this make sense? In a debate, the goal is to state your argument and see who with holds their argument based on evidence and ideas used. My opponent broke this rule of not using any evidence, and this statement should be dropped because its hard to assume if there is or isn't evidence in his argument. If there was, why not post it; otherwise it is a fail and leans towards the Pro side for this debate. Where I did provide evidence, and he has failed to Rebuttal against any of them. And my opponent states: ""It's getting us no where in terms of progressive solutions to move us forward"". In reality, we are trying to move forward by allowing teachers, or someone trained within the school, to get a gun. The standstill is people against teachers being armed, which is why were debating this. I asked my opponent earlier about any alternative solutions to handling a school shooting, and has failed to reply. Because of this, the only solution up to the table is arming teachers; which will progress society forward. To conclude the argument, this debate was lackluster within my opponent. He failed to bring any evidence, and provided no alternatives to how to handle school shootings. My opponents thought process seems is to let a shooter kill young children or adults, with allowing no fighting chance. How is this fair, when it can be prevented by arming someone within the school? For this reasoning, I urge the voters to vote Pro for this debate! And I thank my opponent for this debate."	PRO	26
Scab6587-A45b145fb	Private Citizens should be armed in public	Introduction- a. There are lots of drops, and unwarranted refutations from Con. I will point them out through-out my refutations. b. I stand by the conduct argument for the Reductio ad Aburdum fallacy. Even if my opponent can justify abusive logic (which he hasn't) it is still an unacceptable tactic which violates educational discourse. 2. Refutations- a. People Kill people i. My opponent makes no mention of my status quo argument, on how concealed handguns are legal in every state but Illinois; accordingly I still win this point as I show the horrible impacts Con asserts could happen, can already happen in the status quo, but don't. ii. Read the article my opponent links, you'll see there are some crucial flaws with his logic here. By his own admission it is very difficult, if not impossible to own a gun in Japan; in the U.S. this isn't the case. If you compare Japan's death rate because of guns to America's then it would of course seem like his argument is true, and having access to gun makes people blood thirsty; but that's just not the case. Japan's society is very different from America's[10], Japan's #1 cause of death is stroke, but that doesn't mean American handles stroke better, it means Japan's problems are different. [10] bit.ly/R4skyW b. Guns are pretty scary i. Concealed handguns are legal in all but one state in the United States[5]. If the negative impacts my opponent proposes would happen with affirmation really would happen, then we would already see these impacts in the status quo; the fact that we don't makes this an appeal to fear, not an argument considering the consequences. ii. The gallup survey my opponent uses isn't good evidence as the survey is voluntary response[11]. It isn't an accurate representation of the American public as anyone who has taken an intro stats course will tell you[12]. iii. What this means is that there is not warrant here which asks you to consider the consequences, it's an argument which claims 'bad things may happen so let's play it safe'. [11] bit.ly/RDnjPq [12] bit.ly/J5dYL3 c. Slippery Slope of ownership i. I maintain that this is a logical fallacy. My opponent's deduction consisted entirely of claims which had no warrant to back them up. If the argument were simply a logical syllogism[13] that would be different as I could refute that, but none of my opponent's minor premises had any warrants to them which would posit them as a legitimate argument. [13] http://bit.ly... 3. Refutations a. Second Amendment rights i. My opponent's initial argument doesn't refute the importance of maintaining constitutional rights, instead he compares defending one's right to jumping into the Grand Canyon just-because-you-can. The fact is, whether or not my opponent places any merit in the US constitution or not, it's a right guaranteed to US citizens for protection and defense, jumping into the Grand Canyon is not. ii. Because we see there is a purpose behind the second amendment (unlike jumping into the Grand Canyon), simply comparing it to jumping off a cliff is Reductio ad Absurdum; this is an unacceptable tactic as I have to spend time explaining debate decorum instead of actually debating. b. Security i. Perceived security isn't a false security whatsoever; if it makes a family feel safe it's a benefit. ii. My opponent doesn't respond to the point of guns making the community safer by deterring crime. c. Legality i. There's still. No. Argument. Here. Simply saying my opponent doesn't get the link doesn't mean that the link isn't there; this is a drop two times over. ii. I've extended the fact that concealed handguns are legal in every state but Illinois I don't even know how many times now; that argument comes from this point and was meant to preempt any appeals to fear (such as my opponent's first two contentions). This is a huge impact and it's just been brushed off. Underview- a. The Conduct argument stands. b. My opponent has made a lot of drops.	PRO	27

Scab6587-A61f22699	Private Citizens should be armed in public	"Introduction- Through the course of this debate I will offer several arguments to warrant a vote for the Pro, I encourage voters to examine them and weigh them under a standard of comparative advantage against con's arguments. At the end of the debate, the vote should go to the debater whose arguments are comparatively better than their opponent's. 2. Definitions- a. A ""Private Citizen"" will refer to any American above the age of 17, who has not been convicted of a felony charge. b. ""Should"" will mean 'a good idea'. c. ""Armed"" will refer to possession of a registered firearm. d. ""Public"" will refer to the any area which is open to any person to attend and inhabit. 3. Framework- a. Votes should be based solely on the things expressed in the debate section, no-where else. This includes prior debates and the comments section. b. Since there is an infinite amount of ground that could be covered on this subject, only things explicitly written in the round are grounds of debate. c. The scope of this debate is the United States 4. Second Amendment Rights- a. The right to bear arms is a fundamental liberty given in the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution[1]. therefore, arguments of legality are not legitimate. Instead this debate is one of whether or not it is a good idea for private citizens to be armed when entering public spheres. b. When citizens fail to practice their rights, they weaken its inherency and it loses power. We see that this is the case with the right to vote[2], and a similar link must be made with the right to bear arms. when we fail to uphold this right, we lose sight of its importance. c. We cannot limit our rights based on fear. We see a call for stronger gun control in the public opinion due to the shootings which have received so much media attention as of late, but let us not forget that those are sensational stories and far from the norm[3]. that's the reason they""ve received so much media attention in the first place, because this doesn""t happen every day; to assume as such and limit rights will only take use to the place that implementing the TSA after 9-11 did; a culture of fear which violates rights. [1] bit.ly/WlcqTM [2] cbsn.ws/GA5vcC [3] bit.ly/12k6NFO 5. Security- a. Homes with guns are safer than those without guns. Or at least they have a greater sense of community and make residents feel safer as Dr. Hemenway argued[4]. Hemenway""s study showed that more than half of gun owners cite protection as a reason for owning a fire-arm in the first place. Furthermore, that impact extends beyond their home and into the community. Families who own guns increase community safety by deterring criminals from committing crimes. b. Attendance of gun-safety classes is on the rise, and has only picked up steam since the recent shooting in Colorado and Wisconsin [5]. Referring to the prior argument of sensationalism, Patrick Egan, assistant professor of politics at New York University made a point to say that gun violence has been at an all-time time low for the past 40 years. Aside for those latching onto the sensationalism, most analysts agree that the solution is not to limit the rights of gun owners, but to increase education on gun safety. [4] bit.ly/XCNanr [5] usat.ly/U99JCq 6. Legality in the status quo- a. Despite the school shootings in Wisconsin, they became the 49th state to legalize owning a concealed handgun in November, making Illinois the only state to forbid the practice[5]. This argument can even be seen as an extension of my second amendment argument on how not practicing rights leads to a weakening of their legitimacy. Carrying a weapon is a right for American citizens, and must not be retracted based on principles of fear. 7. Underview- a. I look forward to a good debate, and hope all voters enjoy reading it. b. As it stands the Pro has fulfilled their burden, I remind voters to make their decision based on this debate""s content and not on personal opinions."	PRO	29
Sf7c81d18-Ae6df4cdf	Not all schools have police available to protect them.	All schools and schoolchildren need to be protected yet not all schools are anywhere near a source of protection. Arming some teachers is most urgent in areas police provision is scarce due to diminished funds. Places like Harrold county in Texas have a sheriff’s office situated 17 miles away, and unlike more urban areas they cannot afford to hire district police officers. With the law enforcement officers so far away a lot of children could be killed before there could be any possibility of response from any police of law enforcement agencies. Arming teachers in predominantly rural areas of the USA is therefore a logical and necessary step to protect schools that do not already have dedicated protection.[1] [1] McKinley, James C., ‘In Texas School, Teachers Carry Books and Guns’, The New York Times, 28 August 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/29texas.html?_r=2	PRO	30

The problem is that if those people who want to kill others shoot somebody, the person being shot does not have time to react. Even if they could, the fact that they don't want to kill others makes the gun really pointless. In the hands of somebody nice, guns are not really all that problematic, while in the hands of somebody bad they have the power to inflict a lot of terrible damage really quickly. So why would you be carrying a gun if you didn't intend to kill people, in public? Presumably to scare attackers off. But why would attackers be scared if they know you couldn't react and probably wouldn't use it even if you could? It so happens that there is a much better way of scaring attackers off, and that's making guns illegal in public. That way if somebody is carrying a gun in public, you know they're either an attacker or a police officer. When the fact that all the responsible law-abiding people aren't carrying guns, the bad guys are easy to spot. Guns are pretty scary There's nothing more freaky than having a gun pointed at you. You know in that instant your life is hanging on a trigger, even if it really isn't and you have nothing to worry about. My point is that average citizens of America should have the right to go to town and not feel unsafe or unsettled by the fact that everyone else has the ability to kill them in an instant. Let's talk about the outcomes here. People have to live in fear - they don't have the choice, as everyone has to go into a public space sometimes. Worse still, the alternative is that people become desensitized to guns and ignore the threat until it is too late. It's good that guns are scary, because they can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. Since guns have this power to make people feel unsafe, then that's good grounds to ban them unless there is some real advantage to their prevalence. Slippery slope of ownership If everyone else has a gun except for you, the best psychological defense you have is to buy yourself a gun. This is because guns are the object that are causing your emotional distress - if you feel you have a weapon too, then you feel that you can control the outcome a lot more if things do go bad. Of course, this isn't really the case. Holding a gun is incredibly unlikely to stop a bullet if one is fired at you. So the harm is that you create this big cycle where everyone feels they need a gun - even people who might normally not feel inclined to have a gun, or who might personally feel (perhaps because they know they are prone to getting a little violent) that they should not own a gun. And thus, simply making it legal to carry guns in public increases gun ownership rates. 2nd Amendment Just because it states in your constitution that you're allowed to bear arms does not mean it's a good idea. If your constitution were to explicitly state ""All Americans have the right to jump to their deaths in the Grand Canyon"", it wouldn't make that a good idea either. If it did say that my opponent would make the same arguments - ""jumping to your death in the Grand Canyon loses inherency and power when nobody's doing it!"" - ""we must not be limited by our fear of dying and exercise this right!"" Security This debate is not about whether you should have guns in private (which would include your house or wherever your family lives) but rather in public, making this study irrelevant. My opponent also notes many people know how to operate guns safely. Knowing how to operate them safely and actually using them safely are, however, two different things. Current Legality I have absolutely no idea how this extends my opponent's 2nd Amendment argument. It's exactly the same, because the other laws are all based on the 2nd amendment."	CON	31
Scab6587-A3f12b467	Private Citizens should be armed in public	"Here's some quick reasons why I won each point. People kill people I did attack the status quo point, in every round. People are killing people, and pro agreed. He can write it off as sensationalist, but it's still something to rationally fear, because nobody in this debate likes death. Pro claims my chart is skewed because the Gallup polls surveyed non-Americans - this is a lie. The Gallup poll is of American adults. Furthermore, you'll note that there's not just the Gallup poll, but two GSS polls that my opponent could not respond to. He never responded to my point about a skewed sample only being invalid externally and not internally either. Guns are pretty scary I would rather have a huge person attempt to rape me without a gun than with one, and it's not only for fear of my safety. It's for the fear of the gun. My safety will be compromised either way in that situation - if the rapist saw I had a gun, they'd shoot me first so there'd be no evidence - although if this is indeed a public place where I'm being raped, then the police will catch the gun-wielding rapist for having a gun before their rape. I'm appealing not to fear but to the bad outcomes of it, and pro never told you why those outcomes won't happen. Slippery slope of ownership The major premise is an assumption - that's inherent in the definition of ""premise"" - but I justified it in round one with another argument my opponent never responded to. The minor premise is not irrelevant as the debate is about not what people should be allowed to do, but what is a good idea for them to do. I'm not advocating banning guns in public in this debate. The conclusion is happening, as I've said often enough before. It's not fallacious as the outcome is certain, but even if it was uncertain that doesn't mean it's fallacious. It's the same reason why people buy guns despite the fact they may never be attacked. Second Amendment Rights I said right at the start that not everything that is a right is a good idea. My examples may have been a bit extreme, but they serve to illustrate that what the law says you are allowed to do isn't necessarily always what you should do. My opponent never told you why this refutation wasn't true, which he had to do because the causal link was missing from his case. My opponent made the claim that ""Maintaining the constitutional right to bear arms is important"", so he needs to prove it, not me - furthermore, I explained why this maintenance is a bad idea even if it was important. Security My opponent still fails to respond to my argument that gun safety classes are irrelevant. While the study he uses does say gun ownership deters crime etc, if you buy the article and read beyond the first page you'll find that it's quite explicitly talking about private arms, not arms in public. Pro makes no further responses to my false sense of security point. Legality Apparently my opponent is now claiming this argument is entirely pre-emptive - thus, it is a rebuttal point and not an argument. Pro never managed to distinguish or even properly define what made this argument unique. Conduct Even if it were true my argument were really bad, that does not qualify it as abusive. My opponent never showed you how this was relevant to the debate. We're here to debate - come up with stronger arguments, not stronger insults. It does nothing to undermine any of my arguments or bolster my opponents - were this not ad hominum, it would be a strawman. On a serious note I want to end by expressing my heartfelt condolences to all the families and friends of the victims of the tragic shootings we've been discussing. It pains me to think about this debate in all but the most abstract of terms, but the outcomes here have unspeakably dire (and tragic) consequences. Regardless of who wins this debate, I hope I have been able to spur some discussion on the issue. Now is the time to look at our views honestly, because something is wrong here. Let's change that."	CON	32
Sd518a392-A7fb6e4df	All firearms should be banned.	"My opponent made some fairly good points and pointed out many issues I failed to identify. He also pointed out that the 2.5 million times guns are used in self-defense is my only positive impact I managed to provide on guns. I noticed my opponent overwhelmingly cites other sources rather than my method of theorizing and analyzing. I will adjust my argument as such in this last round. 1. My opponent seems to be confused what the definition of ""self defense"" really is. In my own words, self defense is simply the prevention of bodily harm of oneself from a threat. Pro himself stated some instances of ""self defense"" that were rather absurd in how they were told, which I fully agree with. However, the scenarios would be great examples of self-defense only if the men who were scared off were actually threatening either of the people brandishing guns. We can't let plain stupidity like this be the reason that guns are prohibited if they ever are. Guns can be used by others to protect others as stated by Larry Elder: ""...Moore, legally permitted to carry a concealed weapon, pulled out his gun, and shot and killed the ex-husband. Ms. Cordoba survived the brutal attack and is recovering from her wounds."" (Elder) Larry Elder also criticizes how Dr. Kellerman, who stated the risk of homicide is greater with a gun in the home (which my opponent stated several times), failed to include some factors, which he identified, making his argument obsolete. ""The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence's website displays this oft-quoted ""fact"": ""The risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns."" Their website fails to mention that Dr. Arthur Kellermann, the ""expert"" who came up with that figure, later backpedaled after others discredited his studies for failing to follow standard scientific procedures. According to the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Kellermann now concedes, ""A gun can be used to scare away an intruder without a shot being fired,"" admitting that he failed to include such events in his original study. ""Simply keeping a gun in the home,"" Kellermann says, ""may deter some criminals who fear confronting an armed homeowner."" He adds, ""It is possible that reverse causation accounted for some of the association we observed between gun ownership and homicide – i.e., in a limited number of cases, people may have acquired a gun in response to a specific threat."" Police, with or without guns, cannot be there in time to protect someone from a crime. Whether the person is under attack by a family member, a friend, a neighbor, or lover is irrelevant. As stated: ""Police officers are armed precisely because guns are an effective means of protecting life and preventing violence. However, police can't always be there when a violent crime is in progress -- in fact, criminals plan it that way. Nor would it be desirable to grant police a monopoly over armed self-defence."" (Joly) My opponent stated that between 1976-2005, 14% of murders were ""stranger."" Using information from DisasterCenter about murders between those years, I have averaged and estimated the number of murder per year in the this time period to 23771. Again using math, my opponent states that a 20444 of those murders are from a non-stranger. I also acknowledge that self-defense is NOT included in the equation. While it is commonly believed guns are only used for taking lives, they are also used for hobbies, such as trap-shooting, target shooting, and hunting (which is necessary in order to survive for some people). According to UnitedJustice, 114 people, or 41610 people, die a year from car accidents. According to DrugWarFacts, every tobacco kills 435,000 people, and alcohol kills 85000. I am aware of the inconsistency of car deaths between UnitedJusice and DrugWarFacts, but the numbers are still higher than guns. Even though my opponent makes good points about domestic violence, he continually alienates gun deaths compared to many other things that kill a larger number of people. However, my actual argument toward the non-stranger murders remains the fact that the right to self defense should not be taken away. Pro emphasizes every situation as the participants in the altercations are blatantly having firearms during their argument, but as seen above Dr. Kellerman excluded many factors that he later identified. Even if people are murdered by familiar people, they are no different than a criminal, because ""battery"" as my opponent would say, would make the family member/friend/neighbor/etc. a criminal. It's quite sensible for a person with a disadvantage, such as a 120lb woman with a violent, 250lb pro-wrestler as a husband, to have some sort of self defense method, which may include a gun. In scenarios where a non-stranger blatantly attacks, breaks in, robs, etc. a victim, just because they are a family member does not make the idea of self defense with a gun obsolete. The fact stated by Pro that violent altercations that are made 7 times more dangerous by a gun is limited by the numbers it shows above. It should be left to the discretion of the people involved in any situations both my opponent and I have mentioned on what to do, what not to do, and how to do it. With or without guns, the altercations could still become deadly in a variety of cases including but not limited to blunt objects, physical size and strength, etc. My opponent's ideas as only a hope no one is killed or injured in the event a deadly altercation whether or not it involves a gun. 2. I have noticed that my opponent acknowledged many possibilities of what could happen in the aftermath of a gun bath. The next paragraph works in conjunction with my previous argument, and should be compared as such. My opponent states that 5.5% of the 7 billion people on Earth own a gun, which equates to 385 million people. My opponent states his points as if this many people will hand over their guns, and all who don't will be found and persecuted over a long period of time. What my opponent and I both neglected to mention was that many people are dedicated to their right to bear arms, such as the United States and the Bill of Rights, or Switzerland and their requirement to own a gun. The number of people with guns outnumbers the combined world military. It should be a safe assumption that the members of said military powers who observe their rights may break away and become renegade, providing an advantage with any stolen military equipment that could be commandeered, along with the overwhelming number of people who will not give up their weapons. The search and seizure of weapons, driving up of gun costs, and an overall long-term effort to disarm citizens, as my opponent had stated, would result in a disastrous and deadly wave of protest, which in turn could lead to rioting, which may eventually lead to a full-scale rebellion. Despite whether the governments or rebels are victorious, the effects would be devastating on the people and the economy of the world, which ultimately would cost many more lives than the gun ban was meant to save. An almost guaranteed assumption would be that gun owners will not go down without a fight. Illicit guns was a rather tricky topic to debate, since both my opponent and I are speculating ""what would happen."" Note that since I purely speculated about the economic results, and I did not cite sources for it. I wish my opponent luck in the last round, and the voting period.

Scab6587-Aeeaff8b3	Private Citizens should be armed in public	"In this round pro has done little more than intensify his personal attacks on me, rather than improve his argument. In fact this debate is really very simple. People Kill people Three times in his case, pro falls back on his argument of ""well if all your flawless logic is true, how come I'm not seeing it in the status quo?"" Let me deal with it once and for all now. These things ARE happening under the status quo. I provided a chart last round to show people fear guns more. BTW, even a biased sample can prove a trend if the sample size is significant because sampling bias does not affect internal validity, only external. Pro also agreeds guns are lethal. The evidence is there. Aside from this pro does nothing to refute around three paragraphs of analysis. In particular, he does not refute my claim that it's better to catch killers before they shoot their victims,. He does refute my Japan analogy in detail. The point is that if there are fewer guns in public spaces, there is less gun violence in public spaces, legitimising fear of guns. Not only is this empirically true, it's also not culturally dependant because there's no subjective factor - either attackers have guns or they don't. Guns are pretty scary What pro doesn't get is that it's actually a matter of 'bad things may happen, so let's be prepared in case they do (see previous point), and let's save people from having the confront the risk, or worse still, failing to confront it (this point)'. Even so, I fail to see the harm in ""playing it safe"". This is tantamount to an admission by pro that private citizens would be safer in public under my model. Slippery slope of ownership Here's the argument as a logical syllogism: 1- All people generally react to seeing psychological distresses by seeking to control them (ie buy their own gun) 2- Some people should not own guns 3- Therefore, some people who should not own guns will seek to control them if guns are seen (ie in public) Perhaps pro will finally rebut it. Legality Pro had the clear burden of proof in this debate. He raised two arguments, and then restated his first one and called it a third point. Apparently he thinks it's my burden to show how this point is different from his first one - in fact, my claim has always been that it isn't different, and if pro wants to tell you otherwise, then HE needs to tell you how. Not only that, but he also needs to rebut my analysis for why it isn't different from round two. He has failed to do so - it is him that has dropped this argument, not me. 2nd Amendment Pro's argument is this: if there is a right, and a purpose behind that right, it's always a good idea to exercise that right. Naturally this depends on the purpose. If the purpose of the hypothetical Grand Canyon law is mass suicide, that wouldn't make it a good idea. If pro could prove that the 2nd Amendment is a good idea, then perhaps the reason why it is a good idea might be a strong reason to be armed in public - but in and of themselves, rights and good ideas are different things. Having a right to an abortion does not mean everyone should have one, for example. Security He's dropped his sub-point about people knowing how to operate guns after I proved it was a strawman. His entire point now rests on a single study that did not, contrary to pro's misrepresentation, show any link between being armed in public and reduced crime rates, as the whole study was concerned with private gun ownership. He can't keep claiming I didn't respond when I've been trying to get across to him that his premise does not hold since round two. The other aspect of this argument based on the study - that families feel more secure if they have guns (also not relevant to public spaces by the way) - pro claims to be emotionally beneficial. He has not given any reasons why it isn't a false sense of security, and thus his entire case is a mere assertion. I've also already shown in my points why this is a harm, not a benefit. The resolution is negated."	CON	35
Sd518a392-Af9916c03	All firearms should be banned.	"2.5 million self-defense episodes with guns per year This is really the only positive benefit my opponent has demonstrated from guns. However, his own arguments prove why these numbers cannot possibly be true. If guns are so dramatically necessary as a deterrent against crimes, studies should show massive increases in violence in cities that ban or restrict gun ownership, like Chicago. However, these cities follow broader crime trends in the rest of the nation (crime is cyclical and empirically relates to trends in poverty/demographics). In addition, this 2.5 million number, widely touted by the pro-gun lobby, is preposterous. It is based on a survey done by Gary Kleck, asking people to self-report how often they used their guns in self-defense. According to The Times Online (UK), ""Of nearly 5,000 American adults polled, 1.326 percent -- or 66 -- were determined by Kleck to have relied on guns for personal protection against criminals in the previous year. The rest is basic math -- too basic, some statisticians argue. Take 1.326 percent of all U.S. adults not incarcerated, and you arrive at the conclusion that Americans use their guns 2.5 million times a year for defense."" [1] However, a similar survey that actually asked respondents to describe their ""self-defense"" episodes found that most of the episodes were actually ""hostile gun displays"" such as a gang flashing their guns at another gang (supposedly to ""deter a fight""). The Times Online continues: ""‘Who knows what `self-defense' means?' asked David Hemenway of Harvard University's Injury Control Center. For instance, a thug who shoots in a gang clash might argue he was just defending himself, Hemenway said. So Hemenway crafted surveys of his own. From interviews conducted in 1996 and 1999 involving about 4,500 total respondents, Hemenway found that most acknowledged acts of self-defense were ‘hostile gun displays' rather than ‘socially desirable' moves to halt a crime. Hemenway recently flipped through stories told by respondents describing their acts of self-defense. Here's one: `The police called. The alarm in my building went off so I went there to shut it off. Two men were outside my building, so from my car I shot at the ground near them.' Hemenway paused. ‘That's self-defense?' he asked. ‘Here's another,' the researcher said. ‘A 58-year-old male is watching TV with a holster strapped on him. He tells us, `I was watching a movie, and he (an acquaintance) interrupted me. I yelled that I was going to shoot him, and he ran to his car.' ‘I'm thinking, are these the best stories they can tell?' Hemenway said."" [2] So these 2.5 million self-defense episodes per year are actually extrapolated from a survey where 66 people claimed to have used their guns in self-defense, without providing the scenario for what they defined as ""self-defense."" Surveys that ask respondents to explain what they mean by self-defense find that the majority of the self-defense episodes were actually hostile gun displays. A gun ban would reduce homicides: My opponent takes issue with the widely acknowledged fact that you are more likely to be killed by someone you know than someone you do not. Not only does this make intuitive sense, since strangers are not as likely to have a strong motive for killing each other, but it is also backed up by all the data. The FBI crime statistics record all homicides with a category for ""relationship to the victim."" The overwhelming majority of murders are ""non-stranger"" murders. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, examining national data from between 1976-2005, in only 14% of all murders were the victim and the offender ""strangers."" The vast majority of murders were executed by a ""spouse, other family, boyfriend/girlfriend, or other acquaintance."" [3] The logical conclusion is that a gun ban makes it much less likely that a heated argument between a spouse, lover, or friend will turn into a deadly altercation. My opponent has no response to the Zimring (2003) evidence that assaults (threats/arguments) are 7 times more likely to turn deadly if a gun is involved. He also has no response to the Kellerman (1993) evidence that people are 2.7 times more likely to be murdered in a home with a firearm than one without a firearm. Kellerman excludes ""self-defense"" homicides from this calculation. Illicit guns: My opponent points out that when a gun ban occurs, many bullets and guns will still exist from previous legal production. I acknowledge that a gun ban would not result in the immediate disappearance of all guns. However, police routinely seize large black market gun shipments and destroy the guns in a furnace. As the world adopts such a standard with both guns and bullets, within 10-20 years, most non-military, non-police guns and bullets will have been destroyed, driving up the price to such an extent that criminals can no longer afford the weapons. My opponent takes issue with not all police having guns. This is fine. A gun ban would allow each country to choose what non-civilian exceptions to adopt. I merely described the system England currently employs. My opponent claims that there are anywhere between 12 and 36 billion guns worldwide (no citation). This is empirically false. According to the International Action Network on Small Arms, there are roughly 640 million guns worldwide, 40% of which are operated by government militaries. [4] Considering that there are roughly 7 billion people on the planet, and thus only 5.5% of them own a gun, a concerted long-term effort to disarm citizens, disrupt illegal drugs sales, and drive up the cost of guns (through harsher sentencing laws) should be effective. My opponent has no answer to my harsher sentencing laws argument, that if a ""gun enhancement"" meant an automatic life sentence if a gun was used in commission of a crime (regardless of the crime committed) much fewer people would commit such crimes. In addition, harsh sentences for gun smugglers would deter them from gun smuggling (Chaudri and Geanakoplos of Yale say they would likely turn to drug smuggling if gun smuggling became too difficult). My opponent says, ""Some manufacturers may even develop a way to once again effectively mass produce bullets and guns."" However, they would make easy targets for the military/police if they were mass-producing guns in a giant factory. My opponent then does some analysis that since drugs are illegal and still bought (despite prices being drive up), then the same must be true of guns. However, first, this disproves his own argument: if drug smuggling is more profitable than gun/bullet smuggling, people will engage in the former and not the latter. In addition, the demand for drugs is inelastic (addicts are willing to pay anything to get a ""fix"" and are not price sensitive). However, I cite 5 studies proving that the demand for guns is very price sensitive (elastic): McDowell (1983), Epstein (1999), Chaudhri and Geanakoplos (2006), Cook (2004), and Bice and Hemley (2002). In fact, Cook has shown that due to high local prices, ""Guns are quite scarce in some American cities, and scarcity reduces gun use in crime."" Lastly, empirical evidence shows that drug legalization could makes drugs up to 5 times cheaper, which shows you what a comparative ""illegality premium"" might look for guns and bullets. If guns and bullets were 5 times more expensive 10 years from now, their use would effectively stop, based on the price elasticity of the demand for guns calculated by Bice and Hemley. Much more expensive guns as well as a newly legitimate effort to disarm non-state groups would solve genocides like in Sudan and would solve insurgencies, like the Taliban in Afghanistan, saving up to 500,000 lives per year. My opponent has yet to show any sort of good impact for guns that could outweigh this benefit. [1] http://www.thehighroad.us... [2] Ibid [3"	PRO	36

Sd518a392-A51320ea3	All firearms should be banned.	"I thank my opponent for a fun and civil debate. I begin by refuting my opponent's arguments. My opponent's Kellerman indict is true of Kellerman's statistic that ""you are 22 times more likely to be shot by the gun in your own home than use the gun to shoot an intruder."" The same indict, however, does not apply to the statistic that ""people are 2.7 times more likely be killed in a home with a handgun than one without."" A methodology problem in one area of a study (the self-defense section) does not invalidate the entire study. My opponent points out that other things besides guns kill people. Firstly, two wrongs do not make a right. If the topic were: the U.S. should legalize private ownership of nuclear weapons, my opponent could point out that cars and tobacco have killed far more people than nukes have. That is not a good reason to legalize private ownership of nukes. In addition, applying a utilitarian framework: cars have more benefit than detriments in terms of ease of transportation and productivity gains in the commute to work. In addition, I refer you to an example my opponent used in a previous round: ""it is impossible to drown without water"" (arguing that guns are just a tool). However, the benefits of water (the ability for all of us to live, instead of dying from thirst) outweigh the harms of drowning. My opponent has yet to prove that the benefits from guns outweigh the harms (500,000 deaths per year). Self defense First, it needs clarifying that the Zimring (2003) evidence is saying that when the AGGRESSOR during an assault (threat/argument) has a gun, the victim is 7 times more likely to die. This turns my opponent's point against him. A 120-pound woman has a better chance against a 250-pound wrestler husband than she does against a 250-pound wrester husband who is pointing a gun at her head (note: men have much higher gun ownership rates and are also much more likely to be the aggressor in an altercation). My opponent points out that the aggressor could use other instruments, but remember the instrumentality effect of guns (guns are more deadly). Zimring actually finds that in many cases of single bullet wounds, the attacker regrets his or her action. An impulsive (and later regretted) knife slash is much less likely to result in death than an impulsive (and later regretted) finger pull on the trigger of a gun (because guns are much more lethal). Secondly, my opponent does not answer the crux of my argument: self defense as a justification for gun legality presumes that the two primary usages for guns are 1) self-defense and 2) criminals trying to kill/harm us. These assumptions are not true considering that 86% of homicides are committed by a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, family member, or acquaintance. Therefore, removing guns from the household make it less likely that someone close to us will accidentally or purposely shoot us during a heated argument. My opponent claims, ""An almost guaranteed assumption would be that gun owners will not go down without a fight."" According to Time Magazine in ""Locked & Loaded: The Secret World of Extreme Militias,"" the number of people who join private militias and would/could seriously defend their right to bear arms are a tiny fraction of gun owners. They would not fair well against U.S. military tanks, drones, and close air support. Our military's superior technology is what allowed us to easily take over Afghanistan and Iraq during the initial stages of the invasions. A few high-profile displays against extreme private militia groups (using all our military's firepower, if they refused to acquiesce) would quickly convince all gun owners to give up their weapons without a fight. Lastly, my opponent points out that: ""both my opponent and I are speculating"" when it comes to the black market. While my opponent's arguments in this area are actually pure speculation, I would rather term my analysis ""informed conjecture."" I base my predictions on 5 different studies showing that the demand for guns is elastic, meaning that when prices go up, people buy fewer guns. Cook even went to cities, like Chicago, where illegal guns are hard to buy and expensive, due to strong gun control laws, and found that due to higher prices, far fewer guns were used in crime. Because demand for guns is elastic but demand for drugs is inelastic, smugglers would find drug running much more profitable than gun-running, and the number of black market guns would quickly shrink. Round summary: When evaluating this round, you as the judge should remember that my opponent (the instigator) has the burden of proving that guns should be legal. You should weigh the round using a utilitarian framework: would banning all guns result in the greatest good done for the greatest number. My opponent has nothing on his side of debate at the end of the round, except one vague anecdotal example of a gun that was used in self-defense. With his ""2.5 million self-defenses"" number completely debunked, it is impossible for us to know, as far as this debate goes, how many legitimate self-defenses there are each year using guns. In fact, most of those 2.5 million ""self-defenses"" are actually a reason to vote for my side of the debate: upon further review, a majority of them were actually dangerous incidents, such as gang brandishing or aggressive threats using a gun (Hemenway). Without an exact number to weigh, my opponent cannot make a case against the 500,000 lives per year that could be saved by banning guns. My opponent agrees that most homicides are committed by people we know, not strangers. He also agrees with the Zimring (2003) evidence that when the aggressor has a gun, a verbal altercation is 7 times more likely to turn deadly. Therefore, my opponent agrees with the analysis of why having a gun in your house makes you more likely to die than not having a gun in the home: because when family/friends fight and the fights get extremely heated, it is much safer when there are no exceedingly deadly objects (like guns) nearby. A gun ban would prevent countless such homicides from occurring. In addition, my opponent agrees with my analysis that within 10-20 years, guns can be largely eliminated from the world. By passing gun enhancement laws, countries can dissuade criminals from using guns (automatic life in prison) and from selling illegal guns (automatic life in prison). Because fewer people would be willing to sell guns (especially since drugs would be more profitable and a lighter prison sentence), the number of illegal firearm dealers would decline immensely, shrinking supply. As gun shipments are captured/destroyed and legal factories are shut down, the global supply of guns/bullets will further diminish, drastically driving up the price of guns/bullets. Because purchasers of guns are price sensitive (according to 5 studies), when prices massively rise, people will choose to pursue other sorts of weaponry or forgo buying a weapon altogether. When the price of guns on the black market has soared to astronomical levels, non-state groups (like the Janjaweed in Sudan and the Taliban in Afghanistan) can be disarmed and will not be able to purchase new weapons. This will solve most global conflicts, saving up to 500,000 lives per year. At the end of the day, as long as I prove that at least 2 deaths could be prevented by a gun ban, that outweighs my opponent's one anecdotal example of a self-defense occurring with a gun. And remember, self-defense would not be necessary in a world where guns become too expensive for criminals to afford or in a world where criminals are too afraid to use guns, fearing life sentences from ""gun enhancement"" laws. In order to achieve a gun-free (except military/police) world, I urge you to affirm. I leave you with the immortal words of Chris Rock: ""if a bullet cost $5,000, there would be no more innocent bystanders."" Let's make this a reality."	PRO	38
Scab6587-Af72b0344	Private Citizens should be armed in public	"I thank my opponent for continuing his contentions, although I am disappointed at his claim of poor conduct. That's an attack on me and not my argument. I'd prefer if we stuck to the issues of the debate, which as it so happens was explicitly a part of my opponent's own framework. People kill people I will broadly agree (even though there are good studies showing the contrary) that just because people have guns they do not become more or less violent. That's not my point though. My point is that people with guns are more lethal, their victims less able to run away or fight back. The refutation that people will still attack each other either way, however, ignores my previous analysis that it's much easier (and safer) to catch attackers before they commit their crimes by preventing them from carrying a gun in public. They might still want to kill people, but then they'll be stopped by a police officer or even just random citizens because they'd be carrying a gun in public to do so. I'm the only side in this debate with a tenable model for stopping this gun violence, and that makes this a unique argument. I'll deal with ""appealing to fear"" in my next point, even though the death of people is more than just an emotional harm. Not everything pro may be afraid of is an appeal to fear either. When people die, the society and community loses a valued member, with all the benefits that this member provides - that's empirically bad. My opponent himself admitted that there are people out there who want to kill people when he said that such people are the exception not the norm, presupposing that such people must exist. This is why so few people die in countries like Japan from gun violence (http://goo.gl...) Guns are pretty scary If I had said ""I hate guns WAA WAA WAA!"" that would be an emotional argument fallacy. But when fear creates real, tangible harms to society - when it acts as a mechanism and not an outcome - then that's different. What my opponent doesn't get about the appeal to fear fallacy is that you actually need to be appealing to fear - I'm appealing to serious harms that so happen to be caused by fear. Harms like ignoring threats and wasted investment into public spaces because everyone is scared of going there. Just because something is emotional doesn't necessarily mean it's illogical. This fear does exist in the status quo, which is what I've been logically proving throughout this round and the last. The reason why this debate is even an issue is that US citizens fear guns so much they're owning them less and less (http://goo.gl...). Slippery slope of ownership My opponent claims I provided no warrant. Hello!? Psychological defenses? Really big harm of pressuring would-be criminals into buying guns? I'll bet my opponent took one look at my label and thought ""logical fallacy!"" without even reading my point. 2nd Amendment Aside from the fact my opponent's own source notes a reductio argument isn't necessarily fallacious, he still hasn't proven why putting something into the second amendment or any other law of your country as a right makes it a good idea. The point of my awesome analogy was to illustrate the missing causal link. So yes, I accept the right loses inherency and power (for example) but no, I don't accept this is a bad thing if it means lives can be saved in the process. Security The only difference in security found in the article my opponent links is perceived difference, not a real difference - people gain a false sense of security. I agree, as I proved this logically as part of my slippery slope of ownership point. I'm not sure that this makes it a good idea, and in fact I think it makes it a bad one. But moreover, even if I accept that ""public spaces are safer if there are more weapons in private spaces"" it does not follow that ""public spaces are safer if there are more weapons in public spaces"". Legality Pro still does not prove how this is different from his 2nd Amendment point. The resolution is negated."	CON	39
Sd518a392-A6edac51	All firearms should be banned.	"Weighing mechanism: As the instigator, my opponent has the burden of proof. When weighing the round, the judges should decide whether my opponent has proven that firearm legality has more benefits than detriments. As such, pretend he is actually affirming the resolution ""firearm ownership should be allowed."" He must win his case to win the round. Since the topic is non-U.S. specific and theoretical (""should"" not ""could""), Constitutionality arguments should be excluded. A firearm ban among the general populace would necessarily carve out exceptions for the military and certain special police units (like SWAT teams). Since this is a controversial topic, I implore my judges to set their personal beliefs aside and evaluate only who did the better debating, since debaters are often forced to defend positions they do not agree with. 1. Effect on homicide rates It is widely accepted that you are more likely to be raped by someone you know than by a stranger. The same applies to being killed by a firearm. Guns in the home are far more likely to kill a family member or friend than an intruder because as far as homicides go, you are far more likely to be killed by someone you know than by a stranger. According to an article in University of Chicago Law Review by Frank Zimring, a criminology expert at UC Berkeley, more than two-thirds of killings are caused by spouses, lovers, friends, or neighbors. [1] Zimring examines crime statistics in Chicago and breaks the numbers down by type of weapon, number of wounds, and location of the wounds. He finds that when the wound location was clearly intended to cause death, the use of a firearm instead of the next deadliest weapon (a knife) increased the chance of death of the victim by a factor of 5. This is called the ""instrumentality effect"" of guns. In a broader analysis in Guns in America, Zimring and Hawkins continue to debunk the myth that if guns were not widely available, people would just find another way to kill each other (the classic ""guns don't kill people, people do"" argument). They point out that ""if this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used would show a higher fatality rate"" due to the expected substitution effect. But no such trend exists. Guns simply facilitate certain killings that would otherwise not be possible. As an example, Zimring and Hawkins explain that since guns are both more deadly and more versatile (can be used from a distance), they are used almost exclusively in police killings. Lastly, Zimring/Hawkins cite another study proving the instrumentality effect of guns: comparing wounds in the same location, attacks with higher caliber guns were much more likely to result in death than attacks with lower caliber guns. [2] Without guns, altercations (usually between family members, neighbors, and friends) would be much less likely to result in a fatal injury. In addition, a study by Kellerman (1993) found that people were 2.7 times more likely to be murdered in a home with a firearm than in a home without one, further underscoring the predominance of family/friend murders among the homicide statistics. [3] For the same reason, a regression analysis done by Mark Duggan in ""More Guns, More Crime"" found that looking at time lag data, local increases in gun ownership are soon followed by localized increases in homicide rates. [4] To understand the next study, we must first explore an important legal distinction. A common misconception is that ""assault"" means an attack. However, in terms of the legal definition, ""battery"" means a violent attack and ""assault"" is a THREAT of bodily harm. Normally, an assault should result in nothing more than a heated argument, but the presence of a gun makes it much more likely than an assault will turn deadly. Zimring (2004) found that assaults (read: threats) were 7 times more likely to result in death if the aggressor possessed a firearm. [5] All of the above studies combine to show that a gun ban would result in fewer homicides. 2. Price elasticity A ban on all guns would necessarily drive up the price of purchasing a gun because legal producers have many advantages over illegal producers, such as the ability to operate large factories that enjoy economies of scale and mass production technology. For this reason, most guns on the black market actually come from legal sources. 90% of the guns used by the cartels in Mexico actually originated from legal dealers in the United States. [6] In addition, a study commissioned by Senator Chuck Schumer found that 9 out of 10 guns used in crime originated in the legal market, and in fact pinpointed 140 gun stores that were responsible for selling 20% of all the weapons that eventually ended up on the black market. [7] For all these reasons, a gun ban would drastically reduce the supply of guns and make the remaining guns much more expensive. In economics, there are goods where the demand is inelastic (people are not very sensitive to price) and where demand is elastic (people are very price sensitive and are likely to switch to another similar product [a substitute good] if the price rises). A number of scholars have measured demand for guns and found that the demand is elastic, meaning when price goes up significantly, people either stop buying guns or shift to another related product (a knife, axe, pepper spray). McDowell (1983): ""gun demand is income elastic""; Epstein (1999): ""the demand for guns is elastic""; Chaudhri and Geanakoplos (2006): ""elasticity of demand for guns is very high."" [8] ""Philip Cook, a Professor of Economics from Duke University, noted . . . ‘Criminals' demand for guns is elastic, . . . and to decrease gun violence, we must make guns a liability for criminals, rather than the best, most cost-efficient weapon available.'"" [9] Lastly, Bice and Hemley (2002) find that: ""The demand for handguns is elastic; a 1 percent increase in the price of handguns lowers the quantity demanded by 2-3 percent."" [10] By this calculation, a roughly 50% increase in gun prices would effectively eliminate demand. In addition, a gun ban would make bullets significantly more expensive because bullets could no longer be mass-produced in large factories. ""Bullet control"" can be even more effective than ""gun control."" In the immortal words of Chris Rock, ""if a bullet cost $5,000, there would be no more innocent bystanders."" Although cottage industries can produce small numbers of guns, they cannot possibly create large numbers of bullets. With a gun ban, bullet prices could soar to the point where Chris Rock's vision is realized, where bullets are no longer affordable, even though guns might be. Bullet bans have empirically been more effective than gun bans, such as the ban on civilian ownership of armor piercing bullets. Countries would start adding ""gun enhancement"" laws to their books, as well. The laws would state that dealing illegal guns would be punished by life in prison, and using a gun in a crime (like robbery) could change the sentence from a 5-year sentence to life in prison. This would deter gun use in a world where guns are banned. Lastly, depriving non-state groups of guns (by making guns and bullets too expensive) would solve militia problems, such as in Sudan and would solve insurgencies, such as the Taliban. 500,000 people are killed worldwide each year by guns.

Sd518a392-A4cd53a44	All firearms should be banned.	"I've been in the NRA for about 4 years now, and many times I have been faced with the statement, ""Guns should be banned because..."" Now, I don't specifically blame Democrats/liberals on the issue supporting gun control, I simply look down on anyone who blatantly screams out ""GUNS SHOULD BE BANNED."" I've actually taken time to research some facts and statistics, but I'm not too big on those. We can all agree that facts and statistics can and are changed accordingly in favor of whoever is advocating or protesting the weapons. I've heard and seen various numbers or statements, most of which I've been unable to resolve through research. There's just way too much tampering with numbers, because we can agree that neither gun advocates nor anti-gun advocates want to lose their arguments. Though, true numbers exist. The only effective way I've found is comparing the statistics or facts to other statistics and facts from different sources, and if they are consistent, then I consider it evidence that they are true. However, my personally preferred way to disprove theories about why guns should be banned, is making the people who make those theories think outside the box. I look forward to arguing the simple point why firearms should or shouldn't be banned. I stand as being against the banning of firearms. I will allow my opponent to state the initial contentions."	CON	41
Sd518a392-A633c87f3	All firearms should be banned.	"Thank you, bluesteel, for accepting the debate. 1. My opponent stated that ""Guns in the home are far more likely to kill a family member or friend than an intruder..."" He stated that ""two-thirds"" of killings are caused by spouses, lovers, neighbors, or friends. What I found was that the information by Frank Zimring was rather outdated, dating back to 1967. What pro failed to understand was that Chicago is known to have some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, requiring a Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) that includes extensive background checks and processing that takes anywhere from 3-12 weeks for any type of firearm. Pro also failed to state the exact number of the ""two-thirds"" of the killings occur with, and the type of firearms the murders occur with. He is also implying that because a majority of murders in Illinois (a state with some of the highest crime in the nation) happens between people who know each other such as family, friends, or neighbors, then it must be a problem in states where the problem is less prevalent. Pro also states that guns ""facilitate killings that would otherwise not be possible,"" as well as ""guns are used exclusively in police killings."" While both statements are true, the fact that ""guns are used to facilitate killings that would otherwise not be possible"" can also be applied to countless every-day objects. It is impossible to drown without water, it is impossible to get run over without a car, and is impossible to suffocate if there is no oxygen the same way no one can be shot if there are no guns. The point I am trying to prove is that there are many potential dangers in the world, and guns are being targeted simply because they are ""scary."" While the fact that ""guns are used exclusively in police killings"" may be true, Pro stated earlier in his proposal that ""a firearm ban among the general populace would carve out exceptions for the military and special police units (like SWAT TEAMS)."" This leads me to assume that the police are outmatched by civilians and criminals alike, which rather degrades their degree of training. However, this also displays hows police would be obsolete in protecting the citizens from crime when guns are banned, because guns will still exist in the hands of criminals under the black market, assuming it is criminals (not LAW-ABIDING citizens) who kill them. Even if a gun ban were to happen, there are 90 million in-counting gun owners It is quite obvious that higher caliber guns are deadlier than lower-caliber guns, but Pro failed to be specific on what types of guns he was referring to. It is only assumed that ""higher-caliber"" guns refers to weapons such as hunting rifles or shotguns, and ""lower-caliber"" refers to handguns. However, Pro failed to state any facts or statistics that proves this point. While altercations may be more likely to result in fatal injury, the fact that guns are used between 1.8 million to 2.5 million times a year in self defense (which may include many deadly altercations) overrides this theory, because it is simply stupid to endanger that number of people in order to make family arguments less deadly. It is simply absurd when Pro states that ""gun ownership is followed by increased homicide rates."" What Pro failed to understand was that homicide is the murder of a human being by another human being, and that it includes both self-defense and murder. Pro also failed to do was explain which concept is more prevalent in ""increased homicide."" However, the balance tips in favor of self-defense seeing as the 2.5 million times guns are used to save lives remains consistent. 2. Although the ""bullet control"" would indeed be effective, the inflation may not be as prevalent as theorized. For example, illegal drugs such as marijuana and meth are constantly being imported and produced into the U.S. People manage to smuggle and deal them at prices even average teenagers could afford. The marijuana is grown and the meth is created in labs secretly in houses, in underground hideouts, or countless other methods in hiding. The same would happen with bullets and guns. When American firearm/ammunition companies (such as Winchester or Remington) or foreign companies (such as H&K, Glock, or Wolf Ammunition Industries) as well as countless more are shut down due to the ammuntion/gun bans, their products simply won't disappear. Especially in an economy crisis like the one in the United States, many employees will be looking for alternative ways to manufacture and sell their products. Worldwide, there are billions of guns (I've found inconsistent numbers between 12-36 billion), which most likely means there exists ammunition at an exponentially higher number. Even with bans and legislations, those guns and ammo will not simply disappear. They will continue to circulate in the same fashion they were before, but since they are illegal, it will be under a massive black market. A good example of illicit trading is the Bakaara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, where fully-automatic AK-47's, as well as rocket propelled grenades (RPG's), mortars, and other arms are sold. Some manufacturers may even develop a way to once again effectively mass produce bullets and guns like they did before they were banned. There are, in fact, methods for reusing already-fried ammunition (called reloading) as well as availability of other materials needed. Even though the price and demand may rise, it will not be so exponential that not even a common criminal can obtain it. A box of 9mm (a common handgun round) that contains 50 rounds is between $10-15 USD depending on the quality and brand. If it is outlawed, the inflation may slowly go towards $60-70, maybe more, but if teenagers, criminals, or average people can buy marijuana for up to the same amount of money for a bowl (it is surprising how many people are willing to pay that much), I don't see much of a problem of them buying ammunition. Not to mention 50 rounds is far more than enough to rob at least a dozen houses. Eventually, this rising inflation would rise to people using these outlawed products against each other to claim each other's money and products as inflation slowly rises, the same concept as the ""now I got the money AND the weed"" situation. To sum everything up, over a period of time, a gun ban would cause a disaster in underground dealing, as well as creating more criminals who don't want to give up their guns, and as a result, keep them illegally. Authorities would be at more danger as well, as they are attempting to confiscate deadly weapons that could readily be used against them in the event of a raid or other confiscation method. As a brief summary of my findings, the heated arguments between families, friends, neighbors, or loved ones should be at their own discretion, and not blamed on guns. Even though fatalities occur from these situations, the 2.5 million times a year guns save lives far outweighs these events. I have also theorized that crime would evolve into a network of manufacturing and selling illegal guns and ammo, and would inflation would eventually lead to the industry falling into disaster, presenting a danger to civilians, criminals, and authorities alike.
