S174daab8-Afb9d49bd	Medical Marijuana	"====== Rebuttal ====== [QUOTE] 1) Beneficial in health. As noted by my own opponent, medical marijuana can help alleviate symptoms of pain, discomfort, and lack of appetite caused by many common disease, including AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, etc. This can go uncontested, as my opponent has already agreed that medical marijuana has these properties. Of course, there are even more benefits of marijuana, such as a prevention of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and its progression. (1)(2) A legalization of medical marijuana would aid those who are in pain from said diseases and symptoms. [/QUOTE] The main chemical used in ""medical marijuana"" that helps to manage disease is Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. While THC can be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases, the parts of the cannabis plant used to make ""medical marijuana"" contain only 3% THC. In order to intake this measly amount of THC, the patient must also assume the numerous harms of taking marijuana itself, including the intake over 400 hazardous chemicals and numerous psychological and physiological hazards. Not only that but the few good things that marijuana brings to the medical industry have already been isolated and incorporated into a FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug called Marinol. Marinol preserves the benefits of THC while lessening or eliminating the harms brought about by Marijuana consumption. Medical professionals have noticed the notable effects of certain narcotics in the suppression of pain. Does that mean that they legalize opium or heroin? Obviously no because pharmacists can isolate the positive effects of pain suppression and reduce the rather negative effects of extreme addiction and potential for homicidal rage. Why, then, legalize medical marijuana, when the aforementioned pharmaceutical drugs are superior in every regard to marijuana? [QUOTE] 2) Reduce number of those in prison. The current amount of arrests of marijuana-related crimes totals over 700,000 thousand a year, and that was back in 2005! (3) Of these, a whopping 88% were just for simple possession, while the rest were only for sale or manufacture. (3) These inmates who have done nothing morally wrong or reprehensible are now spending years and years in prison, just for possessing or growing marijuana. 3) Help cut our spending. We currently spend more than 15.5 billion dollars a year on marijuana arrests. (4) If legalized and taxed, not only would we eliminate that spending, but we would also have a major source of revenue that would help pull us out of this recession, as marijuana is our best cash crop, pulling in $35 billion dollars per year. (5)(6) [/QUOTE] Instead of sending those people to prison, we could just make them pay a citation and the citation would depend on how much marijuana the person possesses. This would also help the recession while keeping marijuana illegal. [QUOTE] 4) Little to no side effects. Marijuana causes a very small amount of, if at all, side effects, which are negligible at best. (7)(8) 5) It doesn't make any sense to render it illegal. And that's the crux of the matter, isn't it? It is not overly harmful, if at all, and it doesn't have any second-hand smoke effects. There is simply no logical/moral reason to keep it illegal. No one should have a right to tell you what you can and cannot ingest. You don't violate the rights of others in any way, shape or form, so why should it be illegal? There is not convincing argument as to why. [/QUOTE] This is obviously false. Depending on the user Marijuana usually causes the user to become hungry, lazy, paranoid, etc... Marijuana could cause obesity from hunger and that's if the user can get food. If the user can't get food in time, they will die of starvation. Marijuana could cause people to be lazy and therefore if marijuana was legal, The recession would actually be worse. Marijuana could cause people to be paranoid and lose trust in others causing them to go insane and crime rate may possibly go up and thus, this would do harm to others. ======= Arguments ======= 1)People say that marijuana can make the user ""happy."" Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Honestly, ""happiness"" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine, and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. If I had a bad day at work, would I be justified in using harmful drugs as an escapism? The use of medical marijuana as a means to achieve happiness by escaping from life's problems is neither a just reason for assuming that societal harms achieved by legalizing marijuana, nor does it even fall under the concept of medical marijuana in the first place. 2)What we must see is that current treatment options are far superior to the suggested use of medical marijuana, and any minuscule benefits are far outweighed by the harms of making marijuana easily available. 3)It's obvious that the legalization of medical marijuana has been abused on a widespread basis. Taking the action suggested by Pro provides little to no benefit to those actually sick, while simultaneously harming society as a whole. 4) Marinol is a better alternative to medical marijuana. ===== Sources ===== http://www.homedrugtestingkit.com... http://www.drugs.com... http://www.justice.gov..."

Sd7c339a6-A8f5e1583	Should Medical Marijuana Be Legal	"I believe that medical marijuana should be legal. Marijuana is customarily known as a street drug, but in recent years it has gained its credibility as a medication to treat chronic pain and sooth side effects of chemotherapy for cancer. Already 72% of doctors support medical marijuana. Cancer patients had positive feedback when they tried medical marijuana. They said things like ""It made me feel like I had an appetite for the first time in probably six months"". For the people who benefit from medical marijuana should not be criminalized. Current remedies for pain like Vicodin and Percocet are far more addictive and dangerous. In states where medical marijuana is legalized, doctors have seen a decline in opioid abuse. Making sure people actually need marijuana for medical use and are using it solely for that is where there is a valuable argument. Regulations and government involvement would need to be necessary as with any drug. This also opens up a new industry that could be profitable. There are many ways to consume marijuana than to just smoke it, which is safer to for your lungs. It is unfair to compare the legalization of the medical and recreational use of marijuana, it is a different debate as a whole. The legalization of medical marijuana could steer away from the abuse of opioids and give patients a new way of treatment that has been proven to be effective. It could also change the perception of the drug from a street drug to a medication."	PRO	2
S174daab8-A323e5869	Medical Marijuana	======== Introduction ======== I will be arguing that Medical Marijuana should be illegal while my opponent will argue that medical marijuana should be and/or remain legal. For the purposes of this debate, medical marijuana will stand as Marijuana used to help manage, suppress, or reverse symptoms from medical disorders, such as but not necessarily limited to AIDS, cancer, chronic pain, glaucoma, etc. If my opponent feels that there is something I haven't made clear then tell me during the first round of this debate and I will be more than happy to clarify as best as I can. I want to thank my opponent in advance for accepting this debate. I will let my opponent start his argument first. ====== Definition ====== Marijuana: The female leaves of the Cannabis plant as used to create a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs. Medical: Relating to the study or practice of medicine.	CON	3
Sd267a8f4-A787674b5	Medical Marijuana	"If marijuana is less toxic than many of the drugs that physicians prescribe every day, then why should it not be legalized for medical purposes? Although cannabis has been smoked widely in Western countries for more than four decades, there have been no reported cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana. Professor Lester Grinspoon, MD, from the Harvard Medical School, comments ""I suspect that a day's breathing in any city with poor air quality poses more of a threat than inhaling a day's dose -- which for many ailments is just a portion of a joint -- of marijuana."" Every drug has side effects, and most have potential risks. However, no other drug can do exactly what medical marijuana would do for a patient. Therefore, it should be legalized in order to benefit those suffering from illnesses such as AIDS and cancer."	PRO	4
S174daab8-Ac17b9757	Medical Marijuana	"Thanks to my opponent for his rebuttal. REBUTTALS TO REBUTTALS ------------ 1) //The main chemical used in ""medical marijuana"" that helps to manage disease is Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. While THC can be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases, the parts of the cannabis plant used to make ""medical marijuana"" contain only 3% THC. In order to intake this measly amount of THC, the patient must also assume the numerous harms of taking marijuana itself, including the intake over 400 hazardous chemicals and numerous psychological and physiological hazards.// And that is the user's choice. None of these other 'hazardous' chemicals have ever been proved to be harmful whatsoever. I ask my opponent to source his claims to relevant studies. 2) //Not only that but the few good things that marijuana brings to the medical industry have already been isolated and incorporated into a FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug called Marinol. Marinol preserves the benefits of THC while lessening or eliminating the harms brought about by Marijuana consumption.// There are some very serious problems with my opponent's arguments. (S)He has refused to show how studies contradict his statement. In 1980, when Marinol was released, there were six State-sponsored studies running alongside the distribution of the drug. All of the studies had conclusive evidence, namely the thousands of patients who participated in the studies, that naturally grown marijuana was safer, and more effective than Marinol. (1) One study had a subject accuse his/her doctor of trying to poison him. This patient was one of the experimental trials for Marinol, not marijuana. Might I also add that tobacco and alcohol, while infinitely more harmful to the user than marijuana, are still legal? Why should marijuana be illegal, when it actually provides benefits to the user? 3) //Medical professionals have noticed the notable effects of certain narcotics in the suppression of pain. Does that mean that they legalize opium or heroin? No, they don't. However, as noted in my fifth and sixth arguments, which you tried to hide away, I noted that it was the user's choice, and that the government should have no say in what you can and cannot consume. If you want to eat very greasy food, go right ahead. If you want to smoke marijuana or inject yourself with heroin, go ahead. And if you want to consume rat poison for breakfast, who am I to stop you? 4) //Obviously no because pharmacists can isolate the positive effects of pain suppression and reduce the rather negative effects of extreme addiction and potential for homicidal rage.// Your point? Opium and heroin ought to be legal for the simple reason that it is not the government's role to tell you what to consume. If it is harmful, then the consequences are upon you, and you alone. 5) //Instead of sending those people to prison, we could just make them pay a citation and the citation would depend on how much marijuana the person possesses. This would also help the recession while keeping marijuana illegal.// This wouldn't be a proper replacement for marijuana at all. The criminals would only get harder to catch, and the citations wouldn't be as nearly as good a revenue as it would should marijuana be legalized and taxed. 6) //This is obviously false. Depending on the user Marijuana usually causes the user to become hungry, lazy, paranoid, etc...// Cite sources. Marijuana -may- cause the user to have those symptoms. Anyways, just because marijuana makes you hungry, lazy, or paranoid, this makes the drug so bad it needs to be illegal? That's just inane. And stupid. 7) //Marijuana could cause obesity from hunger and that's if the user can get food. If the user can't get food in time, they will die of starvation.// So, because marijuana may cause someone to be hungry, they will automatically become obese. This assumes that the user smokes marijuana 24/7, and becomes hungry while using it. And then you randomly say, '..IF the user can get food.' What does that even mean? That smoking marijuana will cause you to either become obese, or suddenly become unable to purchase food? That's just foolish. What's with the last statement, anyways? If ANYONE can't consume edible food within a certain amount of time, they will die. That's just common sense, and applies to everything, really. 8) //Marijuana could cause people to be lazy and therefore if marijuana was legal, The recession would actually be worse.// Let's put your argument into a syllogism. P1: Marijuana may make you lazy (not evidenced). P2: If someone consumes marijuana, they WILL be lazy. (False.) Conclusion: Consuming marijuana will make the recession worse. (Non-sequitur, and just a point blank wtf.) Obviously, I need not say anything else. 9) //Marijuana could cause people to be paranoid and lose trust in others// Okay.. //causing them to go insane// Losing trust makes you go insane. What? //and crime rate may possibly go up and Going insane ups the crime rate. Why? //thus, this would do harm to others.// More crime= More harm to others. Somehow. All of this argument is a big non-sequitur chain of fail. Voters, take note that my opponent dropped contention 6. REBUTTALS TO ARGUMENT ------------------------------- 1) //People say that marijuana can make the user ""happy."" Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Not negative. Even if it is, it is the user's choice to use said drug. //Honestly, ""happiness"" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine,// Have you ever heard of an anti-depressant? //and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. If I had a bad day at work, would I be justified in using harmful drugs as an escapism?// Of course! If you have the facts available to you on what the drug does, then you can consume it no matter what! The government ought not control what you ingest.// //The use of medical marijuana as a means to achieve happiness by escaping from life's problems is neither a just reason for assuming that societal harms achieved by legalizing marijuana, This argument doesn't even make sense. It's missing lots and lots of words to make it work. //nor does it even fall under the concept of medical marijuana in the first place.// The use you are describing is called an anti-depressant. Marijuana is an anti-depressant. Look at that, it does fall under the concept of medical marijuana. 2) //What we must see is that current treatment options are far superior to the suggested use of medical marijuana, and any minuscule benefits are far outweighed by the harms of making marijuana easily available.// Disproved that one a while ago. Anyways, legalizing marijuana will lower crime rates. 3) //It's obvious that the legalization of medical marijuana has been abused on a widespread basis. // How? //Taking the action suggested by Pro provides little to no benefit to those actually sick,/ Yes, it does. Multiple studies demonstrating that it does. //while simultaneously harming society as a whole.// How? Show me. It is beneficial in health, helps the economy, and lowers crime rate. 4) //Marinol is a better alternative to medical marijuana.// I call bullsh!t.(1)(2) Thanks to my opponent, and now I turn the debate over to him.

Sd267acd4-Ae95c4062	Medical Marijuana	"Medical Marijuana should be legal in all states because trying to only provide it to clients and not a regular citizen creates more problems in society. A majority of marijuana users find themselves abusing it more than using it as a prescription. It is nearly impossible to keep it only for clients, so why make the job harder for the police departments and try to arrest anyone who carries marijuana. Marijuana is not a serious drug and does not make anyone become violent, yet this generation acts as though it is a crime to enjoy your own free time and relaxing to a natural plant that grows from this earth. What one person is doing to de-stress should not bother anyone else. Although it is rare to hear about someone using medical marijuana for it's main purpose (easing of pain/illness). In 2010, researchers at Harvard Medical School suggested that that some of the drug's benefits may actually be from reduced anxiety, which would improve the smoker's mood. Although some may say that medical marijuana does more harm than it does good, there is plenty of evidence to counteract this. In addition to Medical Marijuana helping to prevent seizures, it can also help to stop cancer cells from spreading. According to an article written by Kevin Loria and Jennifer Welsh, ""Cannabinoids like the active ingredients in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as THC), control seizures by binding to the brain cells responsible for controlling excitability and regulating relaxation."" Loria and Welsh go on to claim that ""CBD may also help prevent cancer from spreading, researchers at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reported in 2007."""	PRO	6
Sd267a970-A809c0365	Medical Marijuana	"Medical Marijuana Medical Marijuana helps cure cancer so why stop it. Im not saying that marijuana is a good thing in this world, but it helps cure the ill. there is some types of marijuana that are good and some types that are bad. Marijuana has been around for centuries and helped cured lots of people through that period of time.Cancer kills people so why stop that? Medical marijuana can help with alot of types of cancer. There was over 658,000 arrest alone for having the usage of marijuana, that would cost the court a lot of time and money, so why spend more money when the united states is already in debt. There is a lot of people in this world that should use medical marijuana for their sickness/illness. Marijuana is a lot safer than alcohol. that not to say that it is completely risk free, it much less addictive and does not cause nearly as much physical damage. Some people do become psychologically dependent on marijuana, and it doesn't mean that its a cure for substance abuse problems. But, from a harm reduction standpoint, it can help. Marijuana can be used to treat and prevent the eye disease known as """"glaucoma"""" which increases pressure in the eye, damaging the eyeball, causing loss of vision. Some people would agree with my claim, and some people wouldnt. For example people would say that more people get arrested, then get treated with marijuana on glaucoma. It helps with cancer, so why stop, Do you want people to die?"	PRO	7

Sd267ad12-A1fab2ee8	Medical Marijuana	Should medical marijuana be legal or no?	CON	9
Sd267ad12-Aedf30aa6	Medical Marijuana	Marijuana should be legal for medical purposes, because it has been shown to be an effective pain reliever, and is less harmful to the liver than most other prescription painkillers. Especially in the case of those who are terminally ill, the negative effects of the drug are insignificant when compared to the improved quality of life it provides to suffering patients. It can likewise reduce the anxiety of the patient during severe medical procedures, and again this is further the case in terminal patients. Severe anxiety has been shown to have immediate detrimental affects on the body, and can complicate some medical procedures. Having yet another option that a doctor may, but need not necessarily prescribe or utilize, only adds more options for the medical system to serve patients. This is not to say that it necessarily should be available for the general public, but certainly for medical usage, as prescribed by licensed doctors, it has a utility that outweighs any possible negatives in many situations.

I hope you can either rein in the argument and assert yourself with logic, or roll with the punches and see where it takes us! I am against ""Medical Marijuana"" being legalized because it physically doesn't exist. There is no such thing other than a human conjuration of meaning. What is being depicted as marijuana is in fact Cannabis, or Hemp. A google search for the scientific name of Medical Marijuana, (Ie. the name of the person who discovered the fauna/flora), and you will discover it is something completely different, something that has been slapped onto another flora and passed of as real. Marijuana itself is part of a slur campaign from the nicotine and cotton industry to destroy Hemp, they renamed Cannabis to Marijuana to confuse people who had used it for generations into thinking some new dangerous 'drug' had been discovered - and successfully throttled any competition to their respective fields. Other indications of this being a slur is in its 'street' name ""Weed"". That itself conjures up a disgusting image when heard, an unwanted product.

REBUTTALS TO REBUTTALS -------------------------------- //Yes, it is the user's choice and it is also a choice that most users regret later. Not all users regret it but the majority of users do and the majority is a bigger number than the minority.// Unwarranted and sourceless claim. My opponent has not provided proof of this statement! Furthermore, even if the user regrets it, that is his or her fault. //I know this from experience so I guess I will use myself as a source. I use to smoke marijuana with some friends about a couple of years ago and it was amazing at first however, I quit because I realized how it was affecting me. My reaction time was slower, I was craving food constantly. I would eat about $60.00 worth of food a day. I didn't use marijuana that much at first but then the addiction started to get worse and worse. I was constantly craving it and I would be stoned at least 15 hours a day if not longer and not only me, but my friends as well.// Personal experience means nothing in a debate, as you basically ask the voter to trust you without any substantial evidence as to why. Furthermore, marijuana is NOT addictive. (1) Also, if your friends smoked it, then it is their fault, and not yours. //I gave sources in my last round....// Just citing sources doesn't prove anything unless they are used in conjunction with the relevant topic at hand. You gave sources, yes, but you didn't show that your claim, 'Marinol is better than medical marijuana,' was contradicted by many studies, as I did. //I didn't try to hide anything, you talk about how people should have choices, it was my choice not to respond to your sixth argument during the last round but I did respond to your fifth argument.// So you basically admit to dropping the argument. That's always fun. Now that my argument went uncontested, the resolution is refuted, unless you have provided a refutation later in this round. //My opponent is technically saying that if you have kids and/or pets that depend on you and you decide to get really drunk, smoke marijuana, and/or inject heroin and you beat, rape, and/or kill your kids and/or pets, it's alright because it's your choice. Stuff like this WON'T ALWAYS happen but it's bad enough without marijuana and other drugs being legal whereas being legal will probably make it worse. It's better to be safe than sorry.// Straw-man. I have noted very specifically in that if it harms the user and only the user, then they can do whatever they wish to their bodies. Not once have I stated that it was morally correct to beat, rape, and kill others. I have said that marijuana is not morally reprehensible because it does not infringe upon the rights of others. It only harms the user. //My point is that it's not only harmful to you, but also to other people and pets around you.// No, your point is a strong straw-man. Anything that indirectly results from your actions while under the influence of marijuana is your fault, not the drugs'. //The government isn't telling you that you can't,// Yes they are, that is what a government does. The laws they make dictate what you can and cannot do. //they are telling you that it's against the law. No, they are telling you that you SHOULDN'T do whatever action under PENALTY OF LAW. //You still have the ability, so technically you still can even though you shouldn't.// The 'shouldn't' is contained within the 'can'. When a government passes a law, they basically say that you can not, and therefore should not, do something under penalty of law. //Exactly, which is why tobacco and alcohol should also be illegal!// 'Kay. //I already gave some reasons in my last round// Which I debased. //however, I will give a few more in this round. Marinol is taken orally, thereby eliminating exposure to other chemicals found in marijuana.// I debunked that claim, view my round 2. Marinol is, in comparison to medical marijuana, an inferior drug. //Once it reaches peak levels in the blood, Marinol stays fairly steady and lasts twice as long as marijuana therefore medical marijuana wouldn't be needed.// View my round 2, which you seem to have glossed over, really. //I don't want my taxes to go to drugs.// The taxes do not 'go to drugs' as you put it. When they are illegal, they go to drug cartels to do whatever with it, likely to grow more pot and thus sell more to the consumer. When it is legal, however, it can go to the government to do infinitely more rewarding things. //This would actually make users have less money because of taxes.// When on the black market, things are higher in value because they are illegal. When they are legal, however, they increase in supply, and thus decrease in value. That's how a black market works. Now, if prices for marijuana went down, they'd have even more money in comparison to before, even given the taxes imposed. //The government would get richer while the pot heads would get poorer.// False. //True, however marijuana speeds up the process where you get hungry more often where you have to spend more money on food and marijuana.// Back to wild claims, eh? Well, as much as I'd have loved for you to source them, you didn't, and I'm just going to debunk this anyways. Marijuana does not speed up any digestive tract processes, as far as I'm aware of. The only thing you can possibly be talking about are hunger pangs, one of the main things marijuana is praised for, because it helps anorexics, patients who undergo chemotherapy, and glaucoma patients get their hunger back so they do not have to be fed through a tube. Anyways, even if you do get hungry while under the influence of marijuana, which is a side effect not seen in many, the cravings do not automatically make you go in a rabid food devouring spree, much to my opponent's dismay. It does not turn you into any sort of wild beast fraught with feelings of starvation. If you do get hungry while under the influence of marijuana, the worst case scenario would you be eating that entire turkey dinner you had planned for Thanksgiving. Drats. //Voters, take note that my opponent was talking about how we should have choices and I chose to drop it during that round but it got responded indirectly in this round.// Not really. And any attempt at doing so was utterly thrashed, if I do say so myself. //I think it's ridiculous that my opponent pointed this out because if you took the time to read the previous posts from the other rounds you would know this.// Nope, because of the simple fact you didn't actual mention it up until this round. Anyways, I again thank my opponent for this debate. The voters however, I apologize to, as no new arguments were made, and the same points made time and again. I am deeply sorry.

S174daab8-Aa46f3e9	Medical Marijuana	====================================================== Rebuttals to Rebuttals to Rebuttals and Rebuttals to Rebuttals to my arguments ====================================================== [QUOTE] And that is the user's choice. None of these other 'hazardous' chemicals have ever been proved to be harmful whatsoever. I ask my opponent to source his claims to relevant studies. [/QUOTE] Yes, it is the user's choice and it is also a choice that most users regret later. Not all users regret it but the majority of users do and the majority is a bigger number than the minority. I know this from experience so I guess I will use myself as a source. I use to smoke marijuana with some friends about a couple of years ago and it was amazing at first however, I quit because I realized how it was affecting me. My reaction time was slower, I was craving food constantly. I would eat about $60.00 worth of food a day. I didn't use marijuana that much at first but then the addiction started to get worse and worse. I was constantly craving it and I would be stoned at least 15 hours a day if not longer and not only me, but my friends as well. [QUOTE] There are some very serious problems with my opponent's arguments. (S)He has refused to show how studies contradict his statement. [/QUOTE] I gave sources in my last round.... [QUOTE] No, they don't. However, as noted in my fifth and sixth arguments, which you tried to hide away [/QUOTE] I didn't try to hide anything, you talk about how people should have choices, it was my choice not to respond to your sixth argument during the last round but I did respond to your fifth argument. [QUOTE] I noted that it was the user's choice, and that the government should have no say in what you can and cannot consume. If you want to eat very greasy food, go right ahead. If you want to smoke marijuana or inject yourself with heroin, go ahead. And if you want to consume rat poison for breakfast, who am I to stop you? Your point? Opium and heroin ought to be legal for the simple reason that it is not the government's role to tell you what to consume. If it is harmful, then the consequences are upon you, and you alone. legalizing marijuana will lower crime rates. [/QUOTE] My opponent is technically saying that if you have kids and/or pets that depend on you and you decide to get really drunk, smoke marijuana, and/or inject heroin and you beat, rape, and/or kill your kids and/or pets, it's alright because it's your choice. Stuff like this WON'T ALWAYS happen but it's bad enough without marijuana and other drugs being legal whereas being legal will probably make it worse. It's better to be safe than sorry. My point is that it's not only harmful to you, but also to other people and pets around you. The government isn't telling you that you can't, they are telling you that it's against the law. You still have the ability, so technically you still can even though you shouldn't. [QUOTE] Might I also add that tobacco and alcohol, while infinitely more harmful to the user than marijuana, are still legal? [/QUOTE Exactly, which is why tobacco and alcohol should also be illegal! [QUOTE] Why should marijuana be illegal, when it actually provides benefits to the user? [/QUOTE] I already gave some reasons in my last round however, I will give a few more in this round. Marinol is taken orally, thereby eliminating exposure to other chemicals found in marijuana. Once it reaches peak levels in the blood, Marinol stays fairly steady and lasts twice as long as marijuana therefore medical marijuana wouldn't be needed. [QUOTE] This wouldn't be a proper replacement for marijuana at all. The criminals would only get harder to catch, and the citations wouldn't be as nearly as good a revenue as it would should marijuana be legalized and taxed. [/QUOTE] I don't want my taxes to go to drugs. This would actually make users have less money because of taxes. The government would get richer while the pot heads would get poorer. [QUOTE] If ANYONE can't consume edible food within a certain amount of time, they will die. That's just common sense, and applies to everything, really. [/QUOTE True, however marijuana speeds up the process where you get hungry more often where you have to spend more money on food and marijuana. [QUOTE] Voters, take note that my opponent dropped contention 6. [/QUOTE] Voters, take note that my opponent was talking about how we should have choices and I chose to drop it during that round but it got responded indirectly in this round. I think it's ridiculous that my opponent pointed this out because if you took the time to read the previous posts from the other rounds you would know this. Voters, please read over and analyze the debate before making your decision to vote. I'm not going to vote for myself unless my opponent votes for himself. If he votes for himself, I will vote for myself to make it fair. I await my opponent's final response wish both of us luck. ======== SOURCES ======== Myself Common Sense http://dying.about.com...

Sd267a8f4-Af0060f12	Medical Marijuana	Although cannabis has been used to treat those sicknesses and problems, it was out lawed for a reason. Medical cannabis has been linked to cardiovascular problems and strokes almost as many times it has been proven as an effective treatment. In Sweden, 50,000 people were tested and proven to have a more likely chance of developing schizophrenia is they have smoked. Also people with schizophrenia were more drawn to marijuana than others.

Sd267a970-A2b2b054f	Medical Marijuana	"Thank you for this debate... Rebuttal I: Cures Cancer / Health Benefits: This is the most commonly thrown around myth of them all... behind, perhaps, the myth that it's not addictive, but Pro acknowledges that it's addictive. In reality, there is no evidence that Marijuana cures cancer. It has been shown to slow down the progression of some cancers, while speeding up, if not just plain creating, new ones. Most studies that claim benefits from Marijuana also list off issues with the drug that often outweigh those aforementioned benefits, including the very study most Marijuana-activists get their cancer myth from (1). Source one requires an account to view, the account is free to create. The viewer and Pro can use the username ""Debate.Org"" with password ""Debate"" to enter, however. Other issues with Pro's argument is that it makes the assumption that Marijuana is the holy grail of drugs, and without it, we've no other option. In reality, there is a list of medicine and options for just about everything Marijuana can do. Without Marijuana, we will still be able to accomplish everything Pro wants. In reality, Marijuana, known for the dangerous and highly addictive chemical THC, is the poorest possible option for many the issues Pro mentions. To pick Marijuana over most any other option would be in poor taste and illogical. Pro brings up Glaucoma... This case doesn't stand to the real world, however. Marijuana may ""help"" Glaucoma, but it's not because it affects the disease. It actually only helps by lowering eye pressure. This only helps because it negates the effects of the Disease. HOWEVER; as Glaucoma.com says, smoking the drug only affects eye pressure for up to 4 hours. It would take around 6-8 joints a day to keep the issue fixed (2). This becomes an issue because the drug prevents the user from doing certain tasks like operating machines, or driving. One would give up his whole life just to do what he could have done with Eye Drops and Pills, as the Glaucoma Foundation's website claims (3). [1] medscape.com/viewarticle/411952 [2] http://www.glaucoma.org... [3] https://www.glaucomafoundation.org... [] Rebuttal II: Law Enforcement of Marijuana: It is true that it takes a number of resources to enforce bans on Marijuana. What Pro fails to understand about legalization, however, is that it's also expensive. The cost to manage the kinds of regulations required to properly and safely legalize the drug would be vast. Possibly far above the income from taxes. However, if instead of prison time, the police fined offenders, there would be less costs. Pro's claim is a reason for Reform, not Legalization. Some would say we'd save money by ending the War on Drugs, but this isn't true. Most drugs would still be illegal, and the War is expensive only because it includes a much larger War on Cartels. Cartels didn't come about to sell drugs, they came about to sell anything that's illegal. If Marijuana is legalized, they still can't sell it legally... 60,000 people have died between 2006-2012 (10,000 people a year) at the hands of cartels, and that doesn't include terrorism and damages (4). Cartels would still be hunted down, and the war would continue. Cartels, knowing they can't become legal, would simply find new revenues, or stronger forms of Marijuana, thus filling the market with a worse version of what we have now. Cartels can't be legalized, so illegal trading will continue, and the War oon Drugs/Cartels will go on. I figured this would be a good topic to bring up. Also, legalize wouldn't help free the people in prison... Ex Post Facto works in both directions. [4] http://www.cnn.com... [] Argument I: Health Risks: Pro has listed some health benefits that I've shown to be wrong. Now it's time to discuss the health risks. Studies claim that it only takes 3 joints a day to have the same health risk of 20 cigarettes (note: remember the 6 - 8 joints a day it takes to treat Glaucoma)(5). This makes smoking Marijuana a major health concern, not a benefit. Consider that giving someone a prescription of just 1 joint a day is the equivalent of having them smoke 7 cigarettes a day, it's a horrible method of treatment, especially when it doesn't actually cure anything. Other studies associate it with the spread and start of numerous other cancers. One study from the European Respiratory Journal reports that one joint a year increases the odds of lung cancer by 8%... Compared to only 7% for an entire pack of cigarettes a year (6). Cannabis, unlike most forms of treatment, is a smoking product, meaning it will produce secondhand smoke. One risks their children getting over 40 - 50 cigarettes worth of secondhand smoke each day just to do to Glaucoma was a pill could have done. Other issues Marijuana is associated with includes schizophrenia, as is supported by over 30 independent studies (7). Another site also links the drug to paranoia (8). These side effects are critical issues that make medical use of the drug highly irresponsible. The only benefit the drug truly has is ensuring a larger range of customers for doctors, and nothing else. The secondhand smoke from this drug alone would be disastrous, and would be an immediate threat to everyone around it. Even for recreational use, the threat to innocent people who have never touched marijuana would be extreme. Secondhand Smoke from cigarettes alone kills nearly 42,000 with heart disease and 3400 with lung cancer each year. Each year, it also causes asthma and asthma-related issues in an astounding 1,000,000+ children, or to be put it into perspective, 12.2% of all children within a whole generation (assuming the total number of unique children within an 18 year generation is 140 million [73 million current children + 4 million additions each year for 18 years.) Cigarettes also lead to between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in babies each year. ALL of these are among non-smokers a lone. The costs of managing secondhand smoke is up to $10 bn a year (9). This is only for smoking Cigarettes... At 7 cigarettes worth per joint, Marijuana legalization for recreational use could likely be insanely dangerous to people who don't even smoke the product. Addiction is also an issue. With an addiction rate of 10 - 30%, and a severe addiction rate of 9% (10). A lot of people will claim it's okay since it's not as addictive as Cigarettes. This is faulty logic, as determining if something is bad isn't based on how bad other things are. [5] http://news.bbc.co.uk... [6] http://erj.ersjournals.com... [7] http://www.schizophrenia.com...

Sc416873d-A14b77a0f	Medical marijuana should be legal	"I apologise to my opponent for the delay in getting this up, and for the abbreviated nature of this argument. Recently, my country legalised medicinal cannabis use (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Since then, we haven't had any significant cases of abuse. Our insurance costs have not skyrocketed, and niether have our taxes. We are not a destination for drug tourism, and we have not undermined our anti-cannabis stance in wider society. When people take medicinal cannabis, their doctors first assess their condition. The doctor's ""do no harm"" mantra prohibits them from proscribing anything that is significantly harmful for the patient. Obviously, most if not all medicines have side effects, but we allow doctors to assess what will work best for the patient because they - not the government - are the ones who know the medicine best. Ultimately we leave the decision down to the patient when a range of options are available for the same reason. To presume that some government buraeucrats have a better understanding of each patient's individual condition (if you will excuse my RoyLatham-esque expression), and thus what treatments should be available, is to undermine the entire healthcare system. Healthcare is a personal thing. Our right to life confers a responsibility for it, and our responsibility for our life empowers us to choose what medicine we take. We make exceptions in various circumstances - for young children, for instance, and for mentally impaired people who cannot understand what is involved with these decisions - but in general the rule is that illness does not rob us of our general autonomy, but rather extends it. It allows us access to public facilities, such as hospitals, just as it opens up access to prescription drugs, for the simple reason that we cannot make a choice when certain choices are prohibited. As a principle, we feel it is entirely consistant with the role of the healthcare system to legalise cannabis. You can't make a full medical choice when certain medical options, endorsed by many scientists globally, are not available to you. For instance, cannabis causes pain relief. It would be a mistake to assume that cannabis is not the right pain reliever for anybody. That's why the choice must be available, in these kinds of difficult medical situations, not narrowed down to a few government-approved alternatives. I personally do not believe there is any evidence cannabis cures anything, or has any helpful effect beyond suppression of symptoms (such as pain). However, since doctors will not have the prescribed the medicine in any situation where it would be harmful, the cannabis would never be used when it is harmful to the patient's health. Since a person who's in hospital all the time undergoing chemo is not exactly going to be drug driving or doing property crime, there's no harm to the public either. Furthermore, research on cannabis is still ongoing. Perhaps it has some helpful effect that science has not yet isolated. It must be the patient, informed by the advice of their medical professional, who makes that decision, not me, because I have no responsibility for their health. My contention is that it should be on the basis of harms to the patient, not the benefits to the patient, that medicine is administered. We already accept the principal that the relative value of benefits must be decided by the patient because we allow patients to refuse treatment. Since cannabis has no real harms when administered in the right way under proper, doctor-specified and recommended conditions, as and when appropriate, there is nothing wrong with medicinal cannabis legalisation. We do not ban the use of placebos if patients want to take them voluntarily. Patients can, if they so wish, hug a teddy bear instead of undergoing chemotherapy and pray to God to remove the desease. These are examples of placebos, and they confer no benefits, nor do they have any particular harms. Cannabis can, under most circumstances, fall in the same category. In the remainder of circumstances, doctors will intervene. As can be shown with countries where it has been legalised, such as New Zealand, this does not translate into a broader problem for society. If you don't accept medicinal marijuana, then as a principle, you deny patient autonomy. You limit the scope of healthcare. But what is of greater value than human life? Even if cannabis has few, if any, beneficial effects, that is no grounds for banning it as a choice. That is why we need to legalise cannabis for medicinal use."	PRO	24

Sd267a8f4-A9b8ba18a	Medical Marijuana	Until its prohibition in 1937, extract of Cannabis sativa (marijuana) was one of the top three most prescribed medicines in the US. The active compounds in marijuana are similar to a class of molecules in our bodies called endocannabinoids. Both bind to receptors in the brain and throughout the body called cannabinoid receptors. This system influences our immune system, protects nerve cells from premature death, and influences mood, memory, appetite, sleep and movement. With cancer patients, it relieves nausea resulting from chemotherapy. For patients with AIDS, it increases the appetite for people suffering from severe weight loss. Also, cannabis is proven more effective than opiates in treating long-term chronic pain.	PRO	28
S2bdac55a-Af9835cec	Marijuana Legislation should not pass.	Medical marijuana as well as recreational use of marijuana should not be legalized in the United States. I do not live elsewhere so i wont include any other countries. Medical marijuana may have certain benefits, but they are not benefits that out do any other type of medication allotted. Marijuana is a drug. It fogs up your brain and changes your perceptional views of reality; as well as your five sense. Cocaine is also a drug. Cocaine has some benefits. It wakes you up. So should cocaine be legalized in a sense that all professionals are using it to stay awake for work; like energy drinks? I personally don't think so. Medically speaking individuals will begin to find any reason and sore to take the drug. To even have fun and enjoy. That's a little strange if you have a traditional mindset. The world should not go down the wrong path. Marijuana will usually make a user eventually lazy, paranoid, and slow. It is proven that it slows your ability to learn. Recreational use, is a big no no. Recreational use makes it look acceptable to children and young adults. Would you like to walk around and just smell marijuana all the time, lets be honest some people may not think its that pleasant. Would you like to go into work where your coworkers are high? Or out to eat and the couple is high behind you? If many people were stoners it would be a major downfall to society. But in the end it would just weed out the people whom don't fall into social pressure and choices. Children don't need to be exposed to such drugs and them to be embellished and shown as something beneficial. People used to say it was a gate way drug. Looks like society itself will enter the gate lol. Many people whom smoke marijuana are usually the people who want it legalized. Those who haven't experienced the drug may have different opinions. Someone who has smoked in the past. (No longer a user) Am happy to have stopped. In doing so life changes, and it becomes more brighter, and honestly more yourself (and cleaner). There are different choices people can take to ease their pain than taking illegal drugs. HOWEVER (a whole other piece of mind) There is a chance medical marijuana could benefit certain people. But these specific people who get seizures, and have life threatening issues, that only cannabis should treat should have special access to the governmental system in which they specifically receive medical marijuana. Only to those who have had excessive testing. People are trying to get certified because they have a scratch or slight back pain, that is not what the drug is for. Other opinions are welcomed!	CON	29

S59d2039e-Ac49ae3ac	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is still a schedule 1 drug despite overwhelming evidence that it has no place being listed that way. According to the DEA, the definition of a schedule 1 drug is as follows: Schedule I Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Some examples of Schedule I drugs are: heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and peyote (1) The DEA has made the claim that marijuana is as dangerous a drug as heroin and LSD without providing any proof whatsoever that it should be listed as a schedule 1 drug. 25 states have legalized medical marijuana which is a direct contradiction to the definition of schedule 1 drugs. These states have recognized that marijuana does indeed have legitimate medical use (2) 4 states have went so far as to legalize it for recreational use. When you look at the drugs in the schedule 1 category it is true that 99% of them have no legitimate medical use as of right now. This is simply not the case for marijuana. According to WEBMD, It is used to treat conditions such as: Muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis Nausea from cancer chemotherapy Poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness, such as HIV, or nerve pain Seizure disorders Crohn's disease (3) Cancer is becoming one of the more common diseases in which patients are being prescribed marijuana. There has been little to no evidence to support the claim that marijuana is anywhere near as dangerous as drugs like heroin or even alcohol which is completely legal. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes whether it be from drunk drivers, diseases, or from alcohol poisoning. (4) ""Alcohol-Related Deaths: Nearly 88,0009 people (approximately 62,000 men and 26,000 women9) die from alcohol-related causes annually, making alcohol the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States.10 In 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths (31 percent of overall driving fatalities).11"" I challenge Con to provide some reliable evidence that marijuana has claimed anywhere near as many lives. Despite the devastating loss of life directly linked to alcohol consumption it is still legal in every state. Alcohol was once prohibited in the 1920's but it was quickly legalized again due to the devastating failure of the prohibition. In 1920 the 18th amendment was ratified to the US constitution that banned the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol until Congress adopted the 21st amendment to counter it (5). 2. Prohibition does not work: The prohibition was a complete failure and only managed to push the demand for alcohol underground. Bootleggars became the only suppliers and they made enormous profits from their illegal operations. Today they would be drug dealers, supplying an overwhelming demand for something deemed too dangerous for the public by the government. It is simply impossible to keep marijuana out of the hands of the public when the demand is so high. This is a plant that can be grown very efficiently in nearly any environment and many people now take their nurseries indoors. This makes detecting these people extremely difficult which becomes a burden on the taxpayers. Marijuana is far easier to grow than alcohol was to produce. According to NORML.org: Marijuana remains the third most popular recreational drug of choice in the United States despite 60 years of criminal prohibition. According to government figures, nearly 70 million Americans have smoked marijuana at some time in their lives. Of these, 18 million have smoked marijuana within the last year, and ten million are regular marijuana smokers. The vast majority of these individuals are otherwise law-abiding citizens who work hard, raise families, and contribute to their communities. They are not part of the crime problem and should not be treated as criminals. (6) The fact of the matter is when something is prohibited, those that wish to obtain it will find a way to do so. The prohibition has done far more harm than good. It's created tens of thousands of criminals whom would otherwise be law-abiding citizens. This in turn creates a burden on law enforcement, the legal system, the prison system, and especially the taxpayers. It is becoming more and more common to see members of law enforcement speaking out against the prohibition of marijuana because it simply does not work. Furthermore it only helps to create the dangerous criminal element that aims to make a profit. Many of these dealers will defend their operation violently. Many people that are opposed to legalization state concerns about marijuana being easier for children to obtain were it legal. Lets look at this concern from a logical position. How many dealers sell alcohol? The answer is none but why is that? It's because dealers are not going to sell something that is perfectly legal and sold in every gas station and liquor store in the country. They would not make any profit from selling a legal substance and they would also likely be arrested for selling without a license. So they would not make a profit and they would go to jail. It would make virtually no sense at all to sell alcohol illegally. Any teen can travel within 5 miles of their residence to obtain marijuana, it is the most common illegal drug today. What's more, drug dealers do sell marijuana because it is illegal. There is an underground market for it and I can assure you that drug dealers are not going to card a 16 year old trying to purchase pot."	PRO	37

I have no problem doing some more research as you requested, but I hope you can respect that I feel there are better ways to handle medical problems than using marijuana. So, with this topic established, how do you feel about legalizing marijuana for recreational use? The way I see it, doing so would greatly endanger communities."	CON	38
S71dd53dc-Ad6a3a5d4	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"Con opens the final round beginning with the contention that some people say that marijuana helps autism, and as such it should be legalized for those parents who want to test it out. I'd like to point out that this doesn't refute any of my arguments (which I will relay once more later on in my rebuttal). Further, marijuana is already legal for this purpose in the form of medical marijuana. And, there are special licenses that doctors can obtain to do medical experiments, so this is irrelevant. So now onto his rebuttal of my 5 arguments... 1. I have no idea what Con's ""rebuttal"" is trying to state. What I said was that the resolution in question was regarding children, i.e. those 18 and under. Extend my arguments until Pro refutes them. 2. Con says that he's not trying to get autistic children to break their parents rules; however, he states this after a round in which he wrote, ""We need to do the next best thing and provide autistic children with an alternate source of marijuana which they can consume, sell, cut for profit."" Because we can assume that the parents of autistic children would not want this for their kids, we must assume that Con believes the autistic children should be able to go against their parents. 3. My point here was that there are alternatives to marijuana that we should be encouraging for those who use it for medical purposes. He said that science doesn't need pin point accuracy. Uh... okay? My point hasn't been negated. 4. Con says that the legal status of marijuana doesn't matter; however, the resolution didn't say anything about changing the law or assuming that the laws were different (or that they should be different). 5. Con still maintains that an all-autistic gang is the best option; however, fails to mention why. I believe such a thing would not only be unethical but unfeasible. Moreover, he still didn't refute any argument from my 5th point. So basically, extend all of my arguments until I get a sufficient rebuttal :)"	PRO	39
S59d1fc3b-Af17ed1aa	Marijuana should be legalized	"I never said that everyone lives in boxes outside. Also, that is very offensive. I understand what you are saying about it helping the economy and what not but it just isn't right. Marijuana is a drug and it is harmful to the body.

I just feel that if the government approves drugs like marijuana, people will think it is alright to use other drugs that are illegal, such as cocaine and acid. I also want to make not of a few things: I not once said it was my ""job"" to tell other people what they can do for fun or even for medical reasons. It makes perfect sense that you are from Colorado because the other states are clearly against it. I was just stating my opinion.

Sd9e09240-A1d95e386	Marijuana Legalization	Marijuana has been in use as a food, medicine, and for textile use since at least 6,000BC. The early American settlers planted hemp for it's various uses. In the 1800's, pharmacies in America began selling cannabis based medicines, and hashish. The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act was the first regulation passed on marijuana in the US. Between 1915-1927, several states banned the 'non-medical use' of marijuana. In 1936, the propaganda film 'Reefer Madness' was released to scare youth out of using marijuana, and is filled with many falsehoods that are still widely believed today. A year later, marijuana was further regulated to the point of prohibition through the Marihuana Tax Act. Then, in 1972, the Nixon appointed Shafer Commission recommends the re-legalization of marijuana. In what can be seen as the start of a conservative right wing led effort to contradict science with self-righteous reasoning, the Nixon administration ignored it's own commission's recommendations. Then in 1975, the FDA briefly established it's Compassionate Use Program for medical marijuana, which now boasts only 7 patients. I present this brief history of marijuana, and the following: the prohibition of marijuana is based on ignorance, self-righteousness, and the lack of common sense legislation. My stance is that marijuana should be legal in modest quantities to responsible adults. I present the following definitions: Marijuana- the dried leaves and flowering tops of the pistillate hemp plant that yield THC and are smoked in cigarettes for their intoxicating effect (http://www.merriam-webster.com...); cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis, mainly. Legal- conforming to or permitted by law or established rules (http://www.merriam-webster.com...) Because I am the affirmative of a commonly negative position (marijuana is commonly viewed as a drug, drugs are commonly viewed as bad), it is difficult to argue my position without hearing the offensive. I will allow my opponent to present his argument, and I will structure my responses around his arguments. Thank you, and good luck.	PRO	41
S68c97443-A550913b8	Marijuana should be legal for adults. (Debate sponsored by King La Ding Enterprises).	After further reading the questions posted by little con, it has occurred to me I should add some more description, and that I will do. Here's what is stopping kids from accessing marijuana, age laws, I specifically did say adult. As for the next question, there is no reason to stop sellers from faking illnesses as legalization of recreational marijuana is also part of the debate. Nothing is stopping people from growing and selling this as long as they abide by normal safety regulation, why not, it should be a legal, regulated, and taxed industry. However like any product to be sold legally it would have to go through any regulations put in place. If patients have it for medical purposes, nothing is stopping them from smoking it if they are adults, same as cigarettes or alcohol. Driving while on marijuana would still be illegal obviously, I should have specified that. And sure if a patient is in a hospital and they smoked it for medical purposes they could be put in a certain insulated room or whatever doesn't seem like a big deal. And what do you mean where would all this money come from, the U.S government can afford medical marijuana, how much does it cost 100 million? That's peanuts to the U.S government who spends trillions yearly, and billions on fu(king pork barrel projects alone. And yeah it would be available for public use, I included recreational marijuana too. And the negatives outweigh the positives in leaps and bounds, but I'll get there next round. And this argument you make that tries to say everyone will think medical marijuana is the new drug that fixes all problems that every existed ever makes no sense, that's such a grandiose claim that you provided no evidence for, it hardly even makes sense. Look little con many many drugs affect male fertility it isn't a new thing, yes marijuana can affect fertility when used frequently, but antibiotics, blood pressure medication, and exposure to lead and mercury all also lead to potential fertility problems among others, so this isn't a new thing, or a valid argument, that's just a side effect of many many needed drugs. You asked if I think that if medical marijuana is federally legalized if i think that would cause everyone everywhere in the country to drop all medical research, again no I don't this is such a grandiose claim that it needs some sort of evidence to prove, and no medical research will still keep going even if marijuana is released that's obvious. And you asked where the government is going to get millions for additional research grants into medical marijuana, as well as some potential costs of ambulance services. How about millions of dollars is like fu(king peanuts for the U.S government, they can throw that in the trash and be fine. But since you wan't I'll propose a plan, the U.S spent over 4 billion dollars in taxes on pork barrel projects in 2016, since pork barrel projects are nothing but nepotism, we will cut pork barrel projects for the purpose of funding medical marijuana research.I'll start outlining the real pros with legalizing medical and recreational marijuana in the following rounds, little con can start with the negatives first if he wants.

S71dd53dc-A70d2fd79	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"I'll just go right ahead and start making my arguments; I don't have to wait for Con to begin :) 1. For legal purposes, I am in favor of marijuana legalization (buying) for those over the age of 18. Autistic ""children"" do not fit within these parameters. 2. Similarly, children presumably live with their parents. Therefore, they must typically abide by their parents rules (especially since they have a mental deficiency). As such, if their parents have decided for any number of reasons (including medical or practical as well as moral) that they don't want their autistic children smoking pot, then said children should not be allowed to. 3. Parents with autistic children have been known to give their kids pot for two reasons: to increase appetite, and for social purposes (such as calming anxiety). However, there are healthier alternatives to increasing appetite and calming anxiety, including medical options (other medications) and non-drug induced ways, including meditation, therapy, etc. Additionally, because being autistic involves other complications and medications that may interfere or have a bigger negative affect on people with autism (including the paranoia aspect of marijuana, and the schizophrenic tendencies that tend to emerge after some people smoke), then it's preferable to seek other options. 4. Although the law isn't always a good indicator of what ""should"" be permissible or legal, the fact remains that recreational marijuana is outlawed in all 50 states. As such, for parents to condone their children consuming illegal drugs would be irresponsible in regard to their impressionable children. 5. Con's only argument has been that there is a low representation of autistic kids in gangs (which is a good thing), and as such they should be given access to buy, sell, and use. However, Con has not yet offered any contentions in favor of these ideals. He has the burden of establishing why this would overall be the best idea. If his points will be based on legalities, I'm prepared to combat it. If the perks he plans to mention are medical, he must show that it's the most useful, practical and overall best medical decision in terms of the problems and effects. If the supposed benefits are economic, then his points should only be considered if I can't offer viable and preferable alternatives. So with that said, I challenge my opponent to put his game face on and come back at me in R2. Good luck, Nails -- this should be fun:)"	PRO	43
S59d1fcd6-A331f1476	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is a gateway No addictive properties? A high is an addictive property. ""According to NIDA, marijuana is the most commonly abused illicit drug in the U.S."" [1] "" It is estimated that 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it."" [2] ""Some drugs are very physically and psychologically addictive and have obvious, terrible withdrawal symptoms. These are easy to identify, such as heroin, barbiturates or alcohol. Others like marijuana are psychologically addictive, and the withdrawal includes psychological symptoms like anxiety, mood swings and depression."" [1] Marijuana is indeed addictive. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects No negative health effects? really? ""In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug. This may be due to increased heart rate as well as the effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias."" [3] ""Marijuana smoke is an irritant to the lungs, and frequent marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems experienced by tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. "" [3] "" High doses of marijuana can produce a temporary psychotic reaction (involving hallucinations and paranoia) in some users, and using marijuana can worsen the course of illness in patients with schizophrenia."" [3] ""Marijuana use during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of neurobehavioral problems in babies."" [3] There are many negative health effects, to claim there are none is just incorrect. Further, to keep saying that is less harmful than alcohol and that is legal is implying I want to keep alcohol legal, which I clearly stated I don't, so it has no influence. ""Someone smoking marijuana in their home isn't going to affect someone outside the home."" You don't know that. Smoke will leave that house and can go over to neighbor's house or you could have third hand smoke. Yes, marijuana might have some medical qualities, but the is about legalizing marijuana as a whole not just medical marijuana. 3. Use of Marijuana is immoral It is true they mention cigarettes, and don't mention marijuana, but you missed the point. You have to look at why third hand smoke is a problem. ""Chemicals that are left over after smoking land on any surface in an area where smoking has taken place. Studies have found that of chemicals in third-hand smoke, 11 are carcinogens (substances capable of causing cancer.)"" [4] It is the chemicals, and carcinogens left over from smoking. Further, ""Smoke from tobacco and cannabis contains many of the same carcinogens and tumor promoters"" [5] Concluding, third hand smoke from marijuana will be just as bad. The butterfly effect is mostly associated with weather prediction, and closely associated with Chaos theory. [6] 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it I just named 19 drugs that have decreased in use in the last 3 years, and only 3 drugs increased. Further, the major decrease in marijuana use shows it is still effective. ""You claim that Portugal has had an increase in crimes but provided no evidence other than your claim."" You mean when I said ""Portugal crime rate has not changed much and actually shows an increase of reported crimes. [5]"" There is a source there, it was published by the EU tracking crime in multiple countries including Portugal. 5. Drug related arrest benefit society I am not sure which one was suppose to refute any claim I made here like the correlation between Incarceration rate and crime rate. 6. Legalization of marijuana will lead to the legalization of other drugs Really? Look at your arguments for legalizing it. X should be legal because we could tax it and make money. ""What people put in their own body is none of anyone's business"" That drug prohibition does not work. X is less harmful than alcohol.

S86fcaef8-Acee5206f	Legalization of Marijuana	I do not agree with you in the slightest. I get it, some people abuse this substance, but it isn't just a drug, it's a healer in a way. There is many people that consider caffeine a drug, yet lots of people do it each day and aren't judged for it, so why should something that can ease your pain not be legalized? Marijuana is not something that I would personally do, not because it's illegal, but because I just don't feel like it and I don't want to. There is some drug problems in the United States, and they aren't going away any time soon. Marijuana isn't bad for your body, as it is a medical substance. Doctors wouldn't prescribe something that they don't know will help or not, they prescribe it because they do know that it will help with your mind and also whatever condition you have. I've had marijuana in my life my whole life, a few times for personal use, and my mom. She did marijuana for her cancer, and now she is completely fine, mostly because marijuana made her not worried about it. For once she wasn't worried about dying from something that she thought would kill her. So yes, it should be legalized, not just in the United States, but the whole world in my opinion.	PRO	45
S815a0edb-Ade89c24f	legalization of marijuana	"I accept your challenge and look forward to an intellectual debate. Since you didn't type much in the first round, I will use this round only for preliminary arguments. First of all, you seem to think that marijuana is a harmless drug. This is definitely not the case. Even though it cannot cause death by overdose, it could indirectly cause death. The state of being high, much like being drunk, could make one lose control of one's own actions. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse even said that ""Marijuana is the illicit drug most frequently found in the blood of drivers who have been involved in accidents, including fatal ones."" Second, marijuana is extremely addictive, with severe mental and physical side effects. According to Dr. Drew Pinsky, a doctor that works with addicts, ""I've been treating cannabis addiction for 20 years. When people are addicted to cannabis, cocaine and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis."" Besides the addiction, marijuana isn't good for mental heath. A Northwestern University study found that ""Marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory and that chronic marijuana abuse may lead to brain changes resembling schizophrenia."" Third, do we really want children to be exposed to this stuff? In Amsterdam, where marijuana is legalized, citizens are rightly alarmed that students and children are exposed to it. If marijuana is presented to young people as harmless, they are so much more likely to become addicted. What's there to be gained by addiction? Addiction controls lives so that their time, money, and well-being are wasted, with no gain to users at all besides temporary ""pleasure"" that alters your thinking state. Finally, marijuana itself is not the only reason that it should not be legalized. Marijuana is usually a gateway drug to other, much more dangerous drugs. Although marijuana could be defended as relatively harmless, most other drugs can't, and legalizing marijuana is the first step to legalizing more dangerous drugs. That's why it's my opinion that marijuana should absolutely not be used, or legalized, for any reasons other than medical purposes."	CON	46
S2a5141f4-Afc1a003	Recreational Marijuana Should Be Legal	Thank you for accepting this debate, I look forward to your opposition. My first point stems off of economic impact. Taxation off of marijuana could bring billions into each state's economy. The legalisation of this substance would also make many different medical disorders easier to treat without a prescription, reducing the cost of the everyday person, and decreasing corporate profits. This would consequently result in lower healthcare costs. (http://taxfoundation.org...) My second point is that of decreasing prison population. Marijuana illegalisation has been an excuse to lock up minorities for the last 50 years. Prison numbers and demographics prove this. If we want equality, we need this substance legalised.

S86da9e6a-A250ddc9c	Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.	"(Dont worry about the delayed response, no harm done :) ) Ok lets get to it then 1) ""Prohibition does not stop consumers from consuming it."" Prohibition of Marijuana does control consumption of it because it severely limits ACCESS to it. People who are addicted to Marijuana will go to extreme costs and pay even more to have access to the drug, but legalizing it would mean everyone would have constant access to it and then millions of more people would increase the number of those addicted to the drug and the side effects it causes..... 2) ""If used correctly Marijuana can be an alternative to many medicines"". Now let me state that this is very true but there are 2 problems. The first is that it must be used correctly, If Marijuana were to be used for medical purposes it would have to be prescribed by a licensed doctor to only one individual who has a disease or ailment that Marijuana can alleviate. After that the prescription only can allow that single person access to a very limited amount of Marijuana so that it could improve his/her health without triggering an addiction. legalizing marijuana for all would cause many many people to abuse it and become addicted to it which would cause more health problems then it would solve since Marijuana only causes ailments to subside by causing a euphoria in the person using it. The second is that this argument is a good argument for the legalization of MEDICAL Marijuana (which i do support) but this debate is about the legalization of Marijuana as a drug. Legalizing it as a drug would make it available to millions of Americans who would most likely abuse the drug or suffer side effects from using it..... Marijuana is safer than tobacco and alcohol, this is true but your comparing it to two of the most harmful substances in the world. Marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco but Marijuana contains hundreds of chemicals that have been proven to be carcinogenic (cause cancer) http://www.abovetheinfluence.com... Marijuana also causes an enormous number of teenage addictions, in fact addictions to Marijuana are greater than addictions to all the other illegal narcotics COMBINED The dangerous aspect about Marijuana is that it directly causes very few deaths compared to other substances (both legal and illegal) but it causes many many other problems that could lead directly to death Marijuana plays a role in 15% of teenage car deaths, 1 in 6 teenage marijuana users become addicted, Marijuana deteriorates memory, attention, and learning skills which can cause people still in school to flunk People who have used the drug feel less physically and mentally healthy It can worsen psychotic symptoms in people which may cause extreme paranoia http://www.drugabuse.gov... http://www.abovetheinfluence.com... http://www.well.com... http://www.teengrowth.com... I agree that Marijuana is not as lethal (keyword lethal) as tobacco or alcohol, but i do believe that Marijuana should still remain illegal because it causes many harmful side effects that can harm people and play a factor (just a factor) in their deaths as well.....

S59d1fcd6-A1cdeeb10	Marijuana should be legalized	"I thank my opponent for giving good opening arguments. I will now give my opening arguments. 1. Marijuana is a Gateway According to a study by the Yale University School of Medicine marijuana is linked with an increased likelihood of prescription drug abuse. [1] The US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also have written that ""Among lifetime marijuana users reporting their onset after age 20, an estimated 1.1 percent used heroin, 16.4 percent used cocaine, and 20.6 percent used any psychotherapeutics nonmedically in their lifetime. Among persons who had never used marijuana, less than 1 percent had ever used cocaine or heroin, but 5.1 percent had used psychotherapeutics nonmedically."" [2] ""One study found that youth (12 to 17 years old) who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than kids who do not use pot, and that 60% of the kids who smoke pot before the age of 15 move on to cocaine."" [3] This shows there is a strong correlation between marijuana use and harder drugs, but this doesn't mean causation; however, ""Because a tolerance builds up, marijuana can lead users to consume stronger drugs to achieve the same high. When the effects start to wear off, the person may turn to more potent drugs to rid himself of the unwanted conditions that caused him to take marijuana in the first place."" [3] This does prove causation; therefore, marijuana is a gateway to other drugs and should remain illegal. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects Some of the short term effects include distorted perception, loss of coordination, trouble with thinking and problem-solving, and increased heart rate. [4] Some of these effects like distorted perception, and loss of coordination will lead to increased accidents harming more citizens. ""A study by the French National Institute for Transport and Safety Research published in theBritish Medical Journal found that seven percent of drivers involved in a fatal highway crash used marijuana. The researchers estimated that at least 2.5 percent of the 10,748 fatal crashes studied were directly caused by the use of marijuana."" [5] ""In Australia, a study found that cannabis intoxication was responsible for 4.3% of driver fatalities."" [6] The government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning it no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. [7] The government also protects its citizens with immunization mandates, fluoridation of water, iodization of salt, pollution restrictions, and banning of hard drugs. The long term effects include lung problems, Cancer, weak immune system, birth problems. ""Smoking marijuana, even infrequently, can cause burning and stinging of the mouth and throat, and cause heavy coughing. Scientists have found that regular marijuana smokers can experience the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers do"" [4] Also, ""Long-time joint smokers often suffer from bronchitis, an inflammation of the respiratory tract."" [8] Second, it can cause cancer ""Because marijuana smoke contains three times the amount of tar found in tobacco smoke and 50 percent more carcinogens, it would seem logical to deduce that there is an increased risk of lung cancer for marijuana smokers. However, researchers have not been able to definitively prove such a link because their studies have not been able to adjust for tobacco smoking and other factors that might also increase the risk."" [4] ""Marijuana smoke contains 50% to 70% more cancer-causing substances than tobacco smoke. One major research study reported that a single cannabis joint could cause as much damage to the lungs as up to five regular cigarettes smoked one after another."" [8] Further, it effects the immune system ""Research indicates that THC impairs the body's immune system from fighting disease, which can cause a wide variety of health problems. One study found that marijuana actually inhibited the disease-preventing actions of key immune cells. Another study found that THC increased the risk of developing bacterial infections and tumors."" [4] Finally, it causes birth problems ""Several studies have found that children born to mothers who used marijuana during pregnancy exhibit some problems with neurological development."" [4] 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral Under the two major schools of ethics, Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics, both consider it immoral. Utilitarianism is ""The ethical theory proposed by Jeremy Bentham and James Mill that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people."" [9] As a Utilitarian would say ""paternalistic intervention may preserve worthwhile lives."" [10] Kant uses what he called the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative is ""In the ethical system of Immanuel Kant, an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire."" [11] In Kantian ethics you must think if everyone had to do this action all the time. Smoking of marijuana would impair normal functioning and every had to smoke marijuana then the world would be a world in which no one would want to live; therefore, it is immoral and should not be legalized. It could also be said by a person who follows kant ethics ""when people act irrationally, they are not acting autonomously."" [10] 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it Developing brains and bodies can be dealt serious blows by the use of marijuana. [12] Anytime you make something legal, you increase the accessibility to children. When something is legalized more people consume it, and when more people have it, it increase the likelihood of children getting it simply because there is more of it. All too often kids and teenagers get their hands on alcohol or cigarettes. [13] We shouldn't let the same thing happen with marijuana. How many kids can get access to cigarette or alcohol, a lot more than can get access to marijuana. So, legalization would only give kids more access to it not less like some claim.

S59d1f83c-A7e084050	Marijuana should be legalized	"I would like to thank my opponent for such an enlightening debate. Now before I begin with my final argument, I would like to make something explicitly clear; sources justify statements . What I mean by this is that anyone can say anything, about anything. Literally, I can tell you that men can transform into bats and go the speed of light. You wouldn't believe this, of course, unless I backed it up with a source: an article describing it happening, a science report on the transformation process, etc. So when someone states something, it's necessary to validate it with a source. My opponent's sources are mostly misinterpreted, as I stated in my last round, and even in his most recent round, the sources were either absent or misrepresented. On a debate that dictates the usage of facts, the reader's must weigh out the sides of the debate based on source usage, among other things. Seeing as my opponent has ultimately failed to use sources objectively (rather, he lies about what the source says), sources should be forfeited to me. This is not me berating my opponent's intelligence or comprehension whatsoever, but it's me clearing up a vital part of this debate. Now, I would like to move on to defending my case, then attacking my opponent's, and finishing off with a conclusion. Economic Benefit My opponent tries stating that marijuana won't create revenue. This is wrong, for I have shown that my estimates target those who already smoke marijuana, and shows the tax money that will come out of it. No business costs more than it makes, for otherwise they would go under, so the idea that it would cost more to legalize marijuana then the billions we currently spend on the ""war on marijuana"" is absurd. Our monetary output for this ""war"" would all turn back around and comes back to us, while we make tax money on the marijuana sales. Marijuana would most likely be taxed as a luxery good, and would probably have a death tax on it (things that harm someone have higher taxes, though marijuana harms nobody, the government would probably still put this tax on it). His amsterdam example doesn't cover anything about marijuana costs, nor is it relevant for it's a completely different culture, with a different economy. Foreign countries provided too many variables when dealing with law based debate. My opponent then tries stating that the marijuana industry already employs tons of people, but it isn't reported....to this, I ask why it isn't reported? Such a statement is completely unsupported. The number is low, and is directed solely at medical marijuana. If cannabis were legalized for recreational usage as well, we would see this employment skyrocket, for even as my opponent stated, things are used more when they are legalized. He then tries arguing that people won't have money for food....this is kind of ridiculous. It's assumed that people will not spend all their money on marijuana, just as people don't usually spend all their money on cigarrettes or booze, though both of those are much more addictive then marijuana. There is no correlation between marijuana purchases and lack of food....and the same goes for marijuana usage and sick days, and marijuana usage and unemployment. People will still have money for other things....if someone want's a TV, they will still go out and buy it, and the same goes for food, gas, books, and so on. Businesses will not suffer to great lengths because of the marijuana industry. Personal Autonomy You can't refute the freedom that is embodied within every man and woman through the constitution. The government has no say in what you do to yourself, because you are you, and you can do what you want with your body. It's for this exact reason that poisons like alcohol and tobacco are legal. Even junkfood causes more issues then marijuana! ""...obligations as citizens, one of which is not to put ourselves into excessive amounts of danger..."" It's this exact thought that causes my opponent's argument to self-refute, so to speak. There are plenty of things that are legal by the government that cause EXCESSIVE damage to an individual, and to third parties. The government can't pick and choose which ones to make businesses out of, and which ones to keep illegal. Seeing as something very detrimental, such as alcohol, is sold widespread, it contradicts what my opponent is saying. Health benefits My opponent misunderstands the nature of marijuana. It contains multiple cannabinoids. THC is the most active, but all of them combined is what gives patients the medicinal effects, and what gives users the high. It's also what prevents cancer. You need the whole thing. Since my opponent has not proven that it is harmful, we can all see no problem with marijuana being legalized. On pharmacy drugs, we must look at the options. Almost any over-the-counter drug can and will be ABUSED, that's just the world we live in. Marijuana CANNOT BE ABUSED. Zero people have died from marijuana, while if you went and bought a bottle of benedril and took the whole thing, you could die. This leads one to believe that it is harmful even in smaller doses, though it's just not as noticeable. Self Medicating: It lowers immune systems in those with immune deficiencies through the smoke. This can be eliminated with cooking marijuana into foods, which my opponent hasn't refuted. Thus, marijuana is still beneficial. Individual harms My opponent simply states 30,000 is far too low of a number......I HAVE ALREADY PROVEN MARIJUANA TO NOT HAVE CAUSED A SINGLE DEATH EVER. 1 in 10 cannabis users UNDER THE AGE OF 15 develop schizophrenia after 11 years. Marijuana would not be administered to young ones, obviously there would be an age limit. ON addiction: ANYTHING can be considered mentally addictive; computers, food, running, even DDO! (shocking, I know!). That doesn't warrant it to be illegal. On withdraw, marijuana also achieved a 1, so I don't see how it is addictive at all, if someone can smoke it for years, and stop suddenly with no ill effects. There is no correlation that proves marijuana students will suffere in their education. I would post my source from previous rounds, drugwarfacts, but I will refrain for the structure of this debate limits it. IF the reader's are curious, however, by all means go click the link and look for education....the results show their to be no general decline in intelligence. I did say that the gateway effect was nonsense, though I will elaborate on it. Let's take an example. A man enjoys smoking marijuana, though it's illegal. He has a drug dealer, who he really isn't friends with, but he sells him pot, so it's all good. That drug dealer starts pushing harder drugs on him, with false premises such as ""It's great stuff, really helps your hair come in!"" and all kinds of ridiculous salesman tactics. If it were legalized, that eliminates the creepy drug dealer. Everyone would be going to the clean, government regulated shops that sell solely marijuana (and probably snacks). The numbers my opponent used, as stated, were far too small to make a conclusive decision. Conclusion My opponent's last couple points, on marijuana users stealing money and destroying property, are not substantiated. Anyone can steal money and ruin property. There is no link to cannabis, just as there is no link to peanut butter and theft when someone steals money and goes and buys peanut butter with it. That's just people stealing. And lobbying and corruption seeps into every industry, even the kiwi one. It's just a matter of time. My contentions regarding the economic benefit, personal autonomy, and health benefits still stand, for my opponent hasn't refuted them. All the readers should give me sources, for my opponent INTENTIONALLY misrepresented them, and has yet to acknowledge his error. I want to thank everyone"	PRO	51
S71dd53dc-A4d8ec949	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"Unfirtunately, PRo Has yet to incorporate any marijuana reeferences into her arguments. Boo hoo, it's water under the bridge, and I'm still having A-bomb debating this. ========= My Contention ========= --""I'd like to point out that this doesn't refute any of my arguments (which I will relay once more later on in my rebuttal)."" It wasn't a reefutation. It was a contention fir my case. I made reefutations below that. --""Further, marijuana is already legal for this purpose in the form of medical marijuana."" Correct me if I'm just blowing hot air here, but medical marijuana is currently legal only for reducing harsh suffering or other medical uses, [1] and only in a fu states at that [2]. It is not currently legal for experimentation on autistic children. If it is, that's fine stuff. Let's kee-p it that way. --""And, there are special licenses that doctors can obtain to do medical experiments, so this is irrelevant."" I'm not trying to bash PRo's trustworthiness, but hopefully she will be able to post a source of this in the next round to show the exact nature of these 'special licenses.' A Google search sparked up very few results. Of the sources I zoomed through, all seemed to talk only of medical marijuana, and only for those 18 or older and only for relief of harsh suffering. [3] [4] [5] It wouldn't really blow my roof to find that there were 'special licenses,' but it is a moot point. This is nothing more than a joint conflation of what is with what ought to be, and in the most loco way. Hopefully PRo will elaborate on why the fact that marijuana is currently legal means that for some reason we should ban it. In the words of theLwerd, ""basically, extend all of my arguments until I get a sufficient rebuttal"" ======= Her Points ======= 1. --""Extend my arguments until Pro refutes them."" To be estra clear, this is the entire text of her original argument 1: --""For legal purposes, I am in favor of marijuana legalization (buying) for those over the age of 18. Autistic ""children"" do not fit within these parameters."" She's telling you to extend her opinion that people over 18 should be allowed to do drugs. By all means do; it isn't relevant at all to this debate because, as she points out, ""Autistic 'children' do not fit within these parameters."" === === 2. ""Con says that he's not trying to get autistic children to break their parents rules; however, he states this after a round in which he wrote, 'We need to do the next best thing and provide autistic children with an alternate source of marijuana which they can consume, sell, cut for profit.'"" A) I also stated that in the same round in which I said, ""Despite the incredible logic behind my original argument, I won't be pursuing it further."" My opponent is attacking an argument that I'm not even arguing and ignoring my current position. Though I don't have my logical fallacies down pat, I believe this would be a strawman argument. B) There is nothing about that quote that sticks out in the way PRo sess it does. It does not say 'autistic children Can consume drugs without their parents' permission.' It in no way impllies that these kids are disobeying parents' orders. C) Extend the uncontested argument I made last speech: ""Given the probable physical and mental condition of those children eligible for this study, I highly doubt any would be able to lay hands on a stash of pot, let alone hide their habit from their parents."" === === 3. PRo again said there are primo alternatives. A) She hasn't verified this claim with any proof yeht. B) I'm fairly certin this is incorrect. There are no cures of autism that I know of. Anyway, that wasn't even the key point of my argument. We shouldn't be feeling confident of our current scientific knowledge, since we are still wet behind the ears when it comes to the study of marijuana. Again, I do not advocate this for the proven health benefits, but to prove health benefits. === === 4. I specifically am arguing that we kick the old laws regarding marijuana use for autistic cheeodren. Suppose the resolution were: Gay marriage should be allowed. Would you ever argue that it shouldn't be allowed because gay people would be breaking the law? Same kind of thing here. The reason MJ is not allowed is that illygal. Thus making it allowed (even if I hadn't explicitly stated it) would most probably come in the form of making it legal. === === 5. I think an all-autistic gang would be a stellar idea. However, I already admitted: ""Despite the incredible logic behind my original argument, I won't be pursuing it further."" PRo is beating a dead horse here. [1] http://medicalmarijuanaguide.com...

S86da9e6a-A60d728a7	Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. First, I would like to apologize for my delayed response, but some things came up that hindered my time to argue. Now, let's begin, shall we? I will argue that marijuana should be legal in the united states because: (1.)Legal prohibition does not stop consumers from consuming marijuana, and it does not stop traffickers from producing and selling it. (2.) If used correctly, marijuana is a great alternative to many medicines. (3.) Marijuana is a lot safer than tobacco and alcohol. My first point, prohibition does not stop users from consuming marijuana, but quite the contrary. Actually, prohibition makes purchasing marijuana for children a lot easier, because a dealer doesn't care if you are 12 or 22, as long as you have money. today, the United States consumes marijuana at a rate some three times that of Europe, although in most European countries, marijuana is legal. (Source: Hakim, Peter, ""Rethinking US Drug Policy,"") For my second point, that If used correctly, marijuana is a great alternative to many medicines that may cause liver failure, overdose, and even death, I cite a dispensary in Denver. They are ""...careful to avoid that stoner vibe..."" and they call ""...marijuana 'medicine' and his customers are 'patients.'"" these places are state ordained, and are noted to be a safer treatment to many diseases, and the people that they see are teachers, lawyers, doctors and retirees, who have afflictions like cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain. They are state oriented medical users, and have the right to use it. my last, (and probably most predominant point) is that Marijuana is a lot safer than tobacco and alcohol. To argue this, please look at some statistics for me. Each year in the United States, approximately 440,000 persons die of a cigarette smoking-attributable illness, resulting in 5.6 million years of potential life lost, $75 billion in direct medical costs, and $82 billion in lost productivity. Alcohol abuse kills some 75,000 Americans each year and shortens the lives of these people by an average of 30 years, a U.S. government study suggests. Excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States after tobacco use and poor eating and exercise habits. Now, what we are all waiting for: Hoe many deaths from marijuana? 0. Not a single case of death ever recorded in the United States that was caused by marijuana. This concludes my arguments, again, I apologize for my delayed response. http://www.gazette.com... http://www.cdc.gov... Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.msnbc.msn.com... Hakim, Peter, ""Rethinking US Drug Policy,"" also, I would like to link you to a youtube video, it is an interview with a medical marijuana patient. www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8_5Ebsjk8I That is all.

S86da9e6a-A6f519bfe	Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.	Marijuana is addictive even if it only causes addiction in a small proportion of people. The Pro said that Marijuana is not addictive whatsoever, I proved him wrong. Im not implying the government has to tell people how to live, dont be stupid. I am saying how some people really dont give a dam about what they do to their bodies and would thus do harm to themselves if drugs such as heroin or marijuana were legalized. Number of Americans who get medical pot from the government = 4, just 4 http://www.cbsnews.com... Marijuana can treat depression for those who have it but it can also cause depression in those who dont have it, see my previous sources Steve Jobs wasnt a pot head, he smoked it a few times his first semester in college and then never did it again so dont glorify him as an example for how Pot doesnt do harm to society The Pro has conceded that Marijuana is addictive and has many dangerous side effects, and the Pro has conceded that there are over 400 agents in Marijuana that cause cancer. Pro has not offered rebuttels to the negative side effects that Marijuana use has been proven to cause or how millions of teenagers do end up in rehabilitation centers with marijuana addiction. His entire debate on why Marijuana should be legal is because it is safer than Tobacco and Alcohol, substances which kill 8.5 million a year combined..... Just because something isnt as harmful as the two most dangerous substances on Earth does not mean it should be legalized, Marijuana is a drug and should not be legalized.	CON	54
S71dd53dc-Ac3efb1b7	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"Autistic Children To clarify, I said that I have no qualms with marijuana being legalized for those over the age of 18. Con never disputed that discrepancy. Because children - including autistic children - are not over 18, they should not be permitted to smoke marijuana. I gave a number of reasons for this, including but not limited to the fact that their parents are responsible for them. When an individual reaches 18 years of age and is seen as a legal adult in the eyes of the law (wholly responsible for their actions, and considered eligible for things like voting and the draft), then they should be allowed to legally smoke pot. Again, autistic children should be no exception strictly in terms of the law. Medical marijuana is a different story - but more about that later. For now, you'll notice that Con's only rebuttal here was that my opinion doesn't matter. As you can see, this is not enough to negate my point. 2. Marijuana's Harm and the Harm Principle I pointed out that parents should not make the decision to give their children medicinal marijuana unless it has been tested or predicted to be severely beneficial. Con's only argument was that (1) I'm in favor of legalization... however, how I really feel is irrelevant; this debate is not about past debates, my opinions, etc. I find it ironic that Con says my opinion doesn't matter in point #1, but then draws upon my opinion as evidence in point #2. Nevertheless, he also writes that (2) marijuana isn't considered severely harmful and (3) JSM's harm principle makes it okay for parents to experiment. Going back to his second point, I pointed out that medical marijuana has in fact known to draw up some severe mental problems, all of which I detailed and linked sources to in the last round. So, for one with a severe MENTAL ILLNESS or even retardation, it might not be the best idea to have them experiment with pot - a known hallucinogen [1]. That could have devastating mental effects on an individual. Con is right regarding marijuana being essentially harmless; however, he didn't take into consideration the harm that it might have on those who are already mentally ill. While one source did mention less irritability, it did absolutely nothing to discuss the child's mental health. Further, you'll notice that Con wrote, ""The autistic children being allowed to receive pot are regularly reported as being violent and being a danger to their parents."" So... autistic children smoking pot are violent and dangerous, and as such we should continue giving it to them? Hmm. Moving on, let's analyze what the harm principle actually says: That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. So a few things -- First, Con has not proven that autistic children are dangerous or harmful. Unruly and aggressive? Sure. But dangerous? No. Second, Con's only proof that marijuana even works is from a report of a stressed out mom whose kid has autism. So, ladies and gentlemen, if MY opinion doesn't count because it's just a regular opinion (I don't have a medical degree), then Con's lone example shouldn't count either. If you check his source, the example provided was by a mom who gave her 9 year old kid pot as a substitute for the medicine he was receiving prior to that. That's hardly proof or hard empirical data in his favor. 3. Alternatives I see absolutely no reason why my list of alternatives isn't an argument. How am I supposed to ""explain them"" as Con suggests? It's pretty obvious that the alternatives I listed were proven medical alternatives to treat autism and the symptoms that pot supposedly helps sure. Moreover, Con says that my alternatives haven't been 100% proven effective... however, he is advocating the legalization of pot for *experimental purposes* -- in other words, his solution isn't proven effective either. Once again, this is a hypocritical argument. My alternatives are healthier and safer because they don't require an already mentally challenged brain ingesting a hallucinogen, but rather making dietary changes and practicing other forms of therapy to help alleviate negative symptoms. Also, saying that the dietary changes are ""controversial"" does not mean that it's bad - it just means that a consensus hasn't been reached regarding precise data. Plus, just because there are ""side effects"" as Con pointed out doesn't mean that those side effects are negative. You'll notice that my alternatives (most of which are therapeutic - and Con only attacked the dietary one) have no known bad side effects according to the link and source, whereas pot does; links for proof can be found in my last round. 4. Legal and Auxiliary Issues As I said in the last round, it was never clarified in the resolution or R1 that this debate was about changing the current laws. So, under the current legalities, I maintain that autistic children should not be allowed to smoke pot as it is currently illegal. However, assuming that they could legally smoke utilizing a medical marijuana card (and using it was recommended by an esteemed physician), then I would not be against it... But, you'll notice that in R1, Con's argument was that autistic children should have access to marijuana that they could CUT, USE, and SELL FOR PROFIT. In that case, I am against the resolution... and you'll notice that Con absolutely did not defend that assertion, and instead has changed the debate entirely to be about whether or not autistic kids should be able to smoke marijuana legally for medicinal purposes. While I've adjusted to the new contentions, Con's altering of his stance in the debate is abusive in terms of debate etiquette. While Con thinks it's okay to simply ""drop the point about the gangs"" ... which by the way has nothing to do with the using and selling for profit, as you don't have to be in a gang to do that ... The reality is that Con ONLY brought other arguments into this which have nothing to do with his original intentions regarding the debate. So, I have been forced to debate something that was never accepted upon in the first round. While Con did clarify that he would add more arguments (and that's allowed), dropping the 1st and only presented argument in R1 to drastically alter the direction of your case is bad conduct. That said, I've also pointed out that even if pot WERE legal, it doesn't necessarily mean that people *should* smoke pot, let alone people with autism, let alone children with autism. If I can prove -- and I believe I have -- that KIDS with autism probably shouldn't be smoking pot, then I have won this debate. 5. Conclusion and Re-cap A) Con never specified that this debate was about changing the current laws. So, under the current laws, autistic children should not be allowed to smoke pot (it's illegal). B) Even if pot were legal, it's not good for child consumption - particularly children with mental illness. Con didn't provide substantial MEDICAL evidence that pot helps; only that it calmed 1 particular child down... which is useless information, as we already know that pot can work as a sedative. C) Pot can be potentially harmful to smoke for those with mental disorders. I linked information in the last round about how it can negatively impact the brain, and provided information as to why it's more likely to be harmful to one who is already experiencing medical difficulties. D) If a parent disagrees of their child using it, they shouldn't be allowed to. E) While parents do make most of the medical situations, they can not make all decisions; some can be overrided by doctors or the State. For instance, a parent cannot give consent for those under 18 to go sky diving because it's too risky. The same applies to autistic kids and pot, and The Harm Principle does not apply.

S59d1fcd6-A306d1650	Marijuana should be legalized	Marijuana is a gateway There are many studies that have proven hard drug users almost entirely start smoking cigarettes as a child before they try any sort of drug at all. Nicotine is an addictive substance that has been steadily increased over the last 6 years. There are virtually no addictive properties in marijuana and the introduction of pain medication has made marijuana an outdated drug in the view of todays youth. When Colorado recently legalized the use of marijuana the use by teens went from 24.8 to 22%. Many of todays youth turn to selling drugs and the prescription drugs have taken hold of the drug market because of the high one can experience and the price is drastically higher than any other drug. Drug dealers seek to make a profit by selling their pills and often times employee young teens to do the dirty work to lessen the chance of getting caught. http://www.nih.gov... http://www.cbsnews.com... http://www.regulatemarijuana.org... (reducing access to teens / 2. Marijuana has bad health effects It is true that marijuana can cause those short term effects but there is a major flaw in the studies stated in my opponents argument. Firstly the percent of the fatal crashes does not even exceed 5% not exactly a substantial amount by no means. Secondly those studies only show that they were users of marijuana, not that they were intoxicated at the time of the accident. Blood tests cannot determine the time of use only that it is found in the blood and since it takes marijuana on average 30 days to leave the system therefore it cannot be proven to be the cause of a crash. Alcohol however takes the lives of 16,000 in 2010 according to the center for disease control because of liver disease. 25,692 died alcohol induced deaths excluding accidents and homicides. Those are staggering numbers found by the CDC. There has been no evidence to show that marijuana has taken a single life. In fact it is used to treat over 230 illnesses and it is ready to use straight out of the ground just the way it grows. Video 3 has a list of studies done that show marijuana has properties that have the potential to actually cure certain cancers. Videos 4 and 5 show physicians supporting the use of marijuana. Cigarettes and alcohol are proven to be severely bad for you and yet they are perfectly legal. Marijuana has been shown to have healing properties and its used to treat a wide variety of illnesses. But to be fair anything taken in excess can have harmful side effects. For example if one were to drink two gallons of water in an hour they would drown and yet water is known as one of the healthiest things we can ingest. Same is true of aspirin if you were to eat a whole bottle at once you would need hospitalization. Now take the side effects of prescription drugs that are supposed to be helping you. The side effects at the end of the commercial are staggering often times causing damage in another part of the body requiring a different prescription to counter the effects of the first. Those that use medical marijuana do not have to take any prescriptions to counter their use of marijuana. Alcohol causes vomiting, headaches and blood poisoning. Marijuana is prescribed to settle the stomach, ease headaches, and does not poison your blood. Its even prescribed to treat depression without the risk of suicidal thoughts 1. http://www.cdc.gov... 2. http://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com... 3. http://www.collective-evolution.com... 4. http://www.youtube.com... 5. http://youtu.be... 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral Morality is not for a certain group to decide. The use of a substance is not immoral unless it harms someone or others. In the 60s hippies would gather together and protest wars and promote peace and love, how can that be immoral. It might be considered immoral if it were to consume ones life and drive them to commit immoral acts such as stealing or assault. Simply put [11] is a hypothetical exaggeration. When a person uses marijuana they do not become aggressive or lose the ability to tell right from wrong as one would under the influence of alcohol. Hence hippies spreading peace and love. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it No one advocating the legalization has said that a child should be allowed to use marijuana. They have asked that it carry the same set of rules as alcohol. You should not be aloud to use it in a public setting where alcohol is not legal. It is common knowledge that prohibition does not work. The government cannot prevent people from crossing our borders let alone the drugs the carry with them. When their is a prohibition put into effect it only pushes the substance to the underground market which is not the safest of conditions to be in. Prohibition empowers drug dealers to make a profit however they see fit. Take alcohol for example, when it was prohibited it gave rise to people like Al Capone who made massive profits off of it in the underground market. This lead to violence and murder but when the prohibition was lifted and the substance was regulated the crime rate dropped drastically. The same is true of marijuana, if you take the business away from the dealer you make the streets a safer place. How man dealers do you hear of selling alcohol? You don't because it is legal. Why would they sell alcohol when you can go to the closest liquor store and purchase it in a safe environment. Drug dealers don't ask to see id but a store clerk will. As a child marijuana was easy to attain simply because it was illegal but alcohol was far more difficult to get my hands on. Why? Because I couldn't find a dealer that was selling a legal substance.

Here is just one of my thoughts: If something is currently not legal, then there is good reason for that. I know exactly what you drug legalization enthusiasts think. You think that these drugs could be used for medical reasons. I know some people believe that these drugs could be great help, but I know that there are better options. There are many different medicines that ARE legalized and why can't we just use those? If we already have a solution there is no need to legalize these drugs.

S86da9e6a-A252de78e	Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.	"""Marijuana is a very addictive drug; it is not as addictive as many other substances but it still is addictive."" Let us quote some of my opponent's sources, shall we? ""The majority of pot smokers do not develop a marijuana addiction, but some smokers do develop all the symptoms of an actual addiction after chronic marijuana use."" (http://alcoholism.about.com...) ""Only about 9% will have a serious addiction"" (http://www.psychologytoday.com...) http://www.spiritualriver.com... says that out of all of the marijuana users, only 4% become addicted. As far as recoveryguy.hubpages.com goes, for some reason, I cannot access the server, and therefore am not able to quote it. ""The reason that many people do not try it is because they do not have access to it or is too expensive for them to buy it from dealers."" Obviously, my opponent does not know enough about marijuana to even argue this point. For only 10 dollars, you can purchase something known as a ""dime bag"", and it will usually have about 7 grams of marijuana in it. This will usually last someone with a medium to high tolerance for marijuana (me) about 3 or 4 days. In fact, I have known several dealers who will sell marijuana cigarettes (Joints) for only 3 dollars. They are also, at least from personal experience, rather easy to come by. Maybe you aren't in the right places? Marijuana is actually more liberally dispensed, because it is not regulated. ""...but not everyone does, and others do not care about the damage they could do to themselves..."" so are you implying that the government has to tell certain people how to live? If I want to kill myself, then I should have that right completely. ""If you investigate further though you will see just exactly who is growing the Marijuana, it is not the states or the government... Tons of Marijuana is grown and the government is doing a rather crappy job of trying to limit access to it..."" Limit it?! They are growing it! Let me direct you to a story that was recently on MSN, and also CBS news. ""Americans get medical pot from the feds"" http://www.cbsnews.com... As far as the marijuana being a cash crop thing, I am willing to let that go, it isn't a focal point to the debate, any way. ""You make an assumption that all teenagers in rehabilitation centers were caught, arrested, and then given an unbalanced choice by a judge to then be forced into rehab..."" I never said all, but it is the VAST majority. ""...Marijuana could cause depression and feel physically weaker and lazier..."" It is odd that you would name depression... ""Marijuana Treats Depression Patients have, in numerous surveys and interviews, reported anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects of cannabis. Patients who use cannabis to ""relax"" may be treating the anxiousness sometimes associated with depression. Cannabis aids the insomnia sometimes present in depression and can improve appetite. Better pain control with cannabis can reduce chronic pain related depression."" http://www.opposingviews.com... As far as lethargy goes, it is true that marijuana can cause that. But then again, so does: Alcohol, Hydrocodone, codeine, cough syrup, tobacco, Adderall, Ritalin, Paxil, and many more prescription drugs, but those are perfectly legal, and two are legal for recreational use. ""As for the 2012 study, relax I made an honest mistake, it should have been 2009..."" Well, then, let's quote that 2009 study, shall we?

Plenty of functioning members of society use or have used marijuana for medical or recreational reasons (Steve Jobs, The majority of our presidents, 42% of the American people, http://www.time.com...) and the country hasn't condensed and formed a black hole. 50% of Americans now say the use of marijuana should be made legal, (http://www.gallup.com...) and I completely agree.

S349ec7ce-A6fdc7cbe	the legalization of marijuana	"well to start, im sick of getting arrested for carrying at least an ounce of mary jane on me....its not right so thats why today i argue that we should legalize marijuana in illinois. many or everyone in illinois would agree, ""yes the economy sucks and we need to fix it"" -average american and now we must take a stand. marijuana has done many great things for us given us a perspective of things in this world that a regular normal life would not give us. time magazine states In fact, the default fate of any politician who publicly considers the legalization of marijuana is to be cast into the outer darkness. this may in fact be true because many of the things that america has tried to do for us by giving us the economic stimulus package and so many bailouts we have to owe ourselves for it.... but our solution has been smoked for over a few thousand years and boy we really need pots help now. many politicians would be looked at as bad people bc of the legalization but many politicians see that it could help boost the economy. by putting taxes on pot it would be a good thing to everyone. giving the opportunity for new legal marijuana jobs, also it would then take out many out of local or state prisons for marijuana smuggling or any marijuana activity and leave room for the ones who really need it *coughcough*(sex offenders) and we all agree the children are the future to America and now we need to give them a better future a brighter one at that. by legalizing marijuana we will in fact give them a better future over 25 million people smoke marijuana and it is the largest cash crop in the United States, and marijuana is grown all over the planet. so no need for the transportation of marijuana anywhere you can just grown it in your backyard or buy it. many drug dealers who are indeed black or hispanic and tend to reinforce the perception that law enforcement is biased and prejudiced against minorities. so in order to make America the land of the free and equal we need to legalize marijuana in order to have peace and also love because we will all be tranquil and happy. also many parents will be glad to know that by legalizing pot will be a good thing. why? well in a very nice and well mannered world they will sell pot at a nice price in the market which in many ways would be out of their pocket money reach. which would tell the teens who smoke to go out and get jobs...which in the end makes us all happy....parents with working teens and a nice economized U.S Marijuana's legalization would simplify the development of hemp as a valuable and diverse agricultural crop in the United States, including its development as a new bio-fuel to reduce carbon emissions. stated by http://www.alternet.org... yes this is all true and if canada and europe support this then we should as well. i mean we want a better way to save money on gas well hemp is the answer. and going on stated by the same person we see that ""Prohibition is based on lies and disinformation. Justification of marijuana's illegality increasingly requires distortions and selective uses of the scientific record, causing harm to the credibility of teachers, law enforcement officials, and scientists throughout the country. The dangers of marijuana use have been exaggerated for almost a century and the modern scientific record does not support the reefer madness predictions of the past and present. Many claims of marijuana's danger are based on old 20th century prejudices that originated in a time when science was uncertain how marijuana produced its characteristic effects. Since the cannabinoid receptor system was discovered in the late 1980s these hysterical concerns about marijuana's dangerousness have not been confirmed with modern research. Everyone agrees that marijuana, or any other drug use such as alcohol or tobacco use, is not for children. Nonetheless, adults have demonstrated over the last several decades that marijuana can be used moderately without harmful impacts to the individual or society."" we shall express ourselves in a better way than this yes our government lied to us about many things but by legalizing marijuana we will in fact learn to understand them and also they will fear us because we are a strong nation as a government for the people by the people and by the legalization of marijuana this nation will be strong yet again. oh and did i forget the medical uses well, no i didnt oh yeah medical marijuana is a good thing also many people can choose to stop the use of marijuana at any given time also it is a very good alternative if many people want to quit drinking. and with that i know wait for any opponent to challenge this topic."

S71dd53dc-A3cdfbf05	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"====== Rebuttal ====== 1. ""my personal feelings on legislation do not apply to autistic CHILDREN (the subject of this debate). Con says that this isn't relevant, but clearly it is."" Well, my feelings on legislation DO apply to autistic children, and they are FAR stronger than Pro's feelings. This means you vote for me. Well, not really. That's just the point, Pro's feelings, Con's feelings, even the judge's feelings shouldn't matter at all. There is no reason to trust Pro's feelings anyway: a. Because she is involved in this debate and stands to gain from testifying for the side she is defending b. Because she has no credentials to qualify her opinion as professional. Her degrees have little to do with medicine. [2] --- 2. ""Con is advocating that a parent use their kids to study something that is not proven to be effective and in fact can severely harm them. This seems like it is violating the child's rights."" Noticing theLwerd's previous debates (and this one as well), she seems to be a clear advocate of marijuana. I'm sure she knows that there are no serious harms associated with it, even for autistic children. [3] Even if that were the case, it's not the child's decision to make. Parents decide whether children get potentially life threatening shots, they spank their kids, and inflict other punishments. A parent's ability to exercise authority over their children generally goes unquestioned. But why is this an issue anyway? Medical Marijuana hasn't even been found severely dangerous at levels far above the recommended dosage. [3] You could even justify it using John Stuart Mill's Harms Principle. [4] The autistic children being allowed to receive pot are regularly reported as being violent and being a danger to their parents. [5] At that point, a parent should be allowed to give their autistic children marijuana, because it is not just for their own benefit, but for their parents and care-givers as well. Finally, I posit that they aren't having rights violated because autistic children would probably enjoy marijuana. Marijuana tend to have a pleasing effect on those who consume it.[6][7] I see no reason why this would be any different for autistic children. --- 3. First, she provides alternatives. A. She doesn't explain them, she just lists a bunch with a link to them. That's not really an argument. B. Her source doesn't testify to the efficacy of any of them. In fact, it does just the opposite for some of her alternatives: ""the use of dietary modifications and supplements to treat the disorder is controversial."" ""[The treatment] may contribute to behavioral problems in autistic patients."" ""Eliminating foods that contain gluten and casein from the diet may cause side effects"" ""supplements (which contain vitamins A and D) MAY improve behavior, eye contact, attention span, and learning"" http://www.neurologychannel.com... C. Her own source even says ""Treatment depends on the individual needs of the patient."" There is no 1 solution that is better than the rest, it depends on the particular person. I would say this is a great argument in favor of marijuana. Allowing marijuana gives autistic children one more possible treatment that might work. In the many sources I've posted, you can find multiple stories of children for whom these traditional medications wouldn't work (for example here: http://www.independent.co.uk...) and who were suffering incredibly (as in here: http://www.kauz.com...) As opposed to many situations where there is one best cure, the fact that the optimum treatment varies would lean in favor of leaving marijuana open as a medical alternative. D. Her own source also says ""In most cases, a combination of treatment methods is more effective."" As with point C above, we need to leave all options open. Even children who have seen fairly effective results with other treatments could potentially be further helped by eating pot brownies. Pro seems to put the child's interests first. If that is the case, then there is no reason why we should ban potentially effective alternatives. --- She then goes on to make the argument that ""I already detailed how one could go about getting a marijuana registration card, talking to their doctor about medical marijuana, and doing this in a safe and legal way."" I fail to see how this is an argument against my case. We can safely and legally have access to this marijuana, then what exactly is the problem here? She also mentions: ""Also, why does this testing have to be done on CHILDREN specifically?"" It doesn't. The point is that it shouldn't be done on adults specifically. Saying 'Autistic kids should smoke pot' doesn't mean 'autistic adults shouldn't smoke pot.' I in no way am saying that autistic adults shouldn't have the same opportunity, just that children shouldn't be left out. It's also important to note here that PRO has drawn no significant line between child and adult for the purposes of this debate. Generally the argument is that children can't properly choose for themselves. In the case of autism, neither children nor adults can properly choose for themselves. But that's beside the point. The point is that the only time CON ever distinguishes between children and adults is in saying children should respect their parents' decision. Any argument on her part distinguishing between between adults and children in the last speech would be completely new and I would never have a chance to respond. --- 4. ""if it becomes legal, it should be legal for STUDIES as my opponent said -- not for autistic people to consume sell and cut for profit."" I made it crystal clear in my last 2 rounds that I am not continuing down the 'Autism Gangs' line of argumentation. In fact, I've advocated exactly what Pro is demanding here: (CON in Round 2) ""I contend that we ought to legalize marijuana for autistic children so that scientists may get to the root of this claim... all parents willing to allow their autistic children to consume marijuana will be used as part of the study."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's exactly what Pro is calling for. --- ""If I can prove -- and I believe I have -- that KIDS with autism probably shouldn't be smoking pot, then I have won this debate."" Not quite. Pro's job is to prove that they shouldn't be ALLOWED to. For example, convincing arguments can be made that Pro's consumption of alcohol is a bad idea, yet that in no way proves that she shouldn't be allowed to do so. --- 5. ""Con concedes that having an autistic gang is unethical and unfeasible."" Indeed, I have. By all means, ignore my original argument that we should form an autism gang. ====== Con Case ====== ""Con has to defend [autistic gangs] in this debate."" I noted in R1 that I would post further arguments, as well as posting in comments that ""That's not really my argument for it. I plan on posting actual arguments in r2; I just needed something to put in r1."" theLwerd also talks about marijuana currently being legal. Just extend the argument I already made that: ""It wouldn't really blow my roof to find that there were 'special licenses,' but it is a moot point. This is nothing more than a conflation of what is with what ought to be, and in the most loco way."" This went completely unaddressed: Whatever the current situation, it has no bearing on what we should do. [2] http://www.debate.org... [3] http://www.doublex.com... [4] http://davidhildebrand.org...

Sd42a9277-A2079d3c0	Marijuana should be legal all across the world	I have read and fully understand your argument and u along with many others seem to be alluded by propaganda of the bad things that are seen to be surrounding marijuana but infact this is all due to the fact that marijuana as it is at the moment is not regulated by most of the world and yes the main argument is that if marijuana is legalised it shall free up police for more serious crimes and cracking down on harder drugs but not only this the average tax payer would benefit as we would pay less tax towards policing and as it is the government are all ready cutting the police and this could be the little relief on the police needed to maintain the harder sections of the law this is not the only thing that would benefit the average tax payer if legalised or even decriminalised for medical purposes the government would et tax on top of the selling of it and in total would equal 67 million dollars (my source was American) a year and that's just in tax revenue. Money is not the only benefiting factor while debating the legalisation of marijuana there is of course the medical benefits as there are many rare conditions that are able to be tamed or even cured with the use of marijuana there has also been studies and evidence of marijuana helping people with cancer enter remission. As you where saying we don't want to be known as the generation of stoners so to speak but that does not have to happen as there are two main chemicals in marijuana one called THC the one that gets you high and one called CBD and this chemical can cure or suppress certain illnesses such as a rare illness called Draft Syndrome. There is a news article about an American girl aged 5 hat had this disease she had got up to 300 fits a week and the parents were running out of options and although their whole life the were con marijuana it seemed Rio be the only option left this left them no choice but to hunt for a marijuana that was low in THC but high in CBD in order to help there daughter to which they succeeded as they found some registered growers that had cross bread to make such a strain the family bought some to try it and asked a friend to extract the essence and put it into a syringe for them to which she did the parents tried it and to there amazement it had worked their daughter had gone from 300 fits to just 1, without that marijuana she would have died and at a very young age. What I'm trying to say is that we do not need to use it recreational and et high but we can use it medically in order to help people and family's such as the figis. I trust that after I have truly explained marijuana behind the deluded misconception that most people see that you will realise marijuana isn't just there to get high from and it is not all bad infact the good of it outways the bad as yes smoking it gives you bronchitis but eating the essence with food does not so alb you feel I am talking about just getting high I am not I am talking about something much much more and it is not necessarily just there for people to get high from.

Sdb751e93-Ac09c1b78	Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I would like to begin by defining a couple of terms. If my opponent disagrees with my definitions, then he/she can suggest and justify alternative definitions, however terminology should be agreed upon within the first half of the debate. I will not use dictionary definitions; let us just keep it simple. Possession means owning something. Use means smoking/inhaling/eating/vaporizing/etc. marijuan. Recreational marijuana means that adults ABOVE THE AGE OF 21 YEARS OLD are allowed to purchase up to SEVEN GRAMS of marijuana for any reason, with no medical conditions required. Legalized means that we remove the penalties from marijuana activities and that we regulate marijuana in dispensaries at which consumers of age can purchase it. The U.S. refers to all fifty states of the United States of America; the resolution seeks to essentially overturn the national ban on cannabis. The framework for this round should be net benefits. Unless my opponent is able to demonstrate that the costs of legalizing marijuana in the U.S. overwhelmingly outweigh the benefits, the Pro should win the round. Contention 1: Economic Benefits. Legalizing pot allows the United States to allow a wealth of economic benefits in the form of tax revenue and also in the form of liberating costly prisoners from incarceration. We have already seen examples of collecting revenue. According to the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), between January 2014 and October 2014, Colorado accrued 40 million dollars of tax revenue by legalizing marijuana and allowing 21+ citizens to purchase it. Suppose that we extrapolated legalization to the whole country. According to the Huffington Post, this would result in $8.7 billion per year in the form of state and federal taxes. Taxing any good or service allows the economy to grow, because it provides money that is uesd for other programs. In the case of marijuana legalization, these programs translate to education, health care, and drug addiction treatment, valuable impacts in our society. Furthermore, legalizing marijuana prevents costs that are associated with incarcerating individuals. According to the DPA, approximately 750 thousand citizens are arrested for an infraction of marijuana law each year. Furthermore, the cost of incarceration is $47,000 per prisoner per year. This translates to 7 to 10 billion dollars per year that are wasted on locking up stoners (rather than rapists or murderers). Clearly, not only does legalizing marijuana create money; keeping it illegal costs money. This 35 billion dollars could be used to reduce the national deficit, solve other crimes, or perhaps reduce taxes on American citizens. Contention 2: Legalizing marijuana reduces crime. Legalizing marijuana prevents police officers from wasting their time arresting harmless stoners, when they could be spending these efforts and resources fighting actually dangerous crimes, such as murder, theft, or rape. According to RollingStone Magazine, marijuana arrests are no longer real ""police work""; law enforcement would rather spend their time tackling other crimes such as murder and rape. This argument is intuitive rather than logical; less time wasted on activity X (stopping pot smoke) leads to more time available for activity Y (stopping murder). LearnLiberty echoes this message: ""legalizing marijuana frees up resources to solve other crimes"". The impact is clear: a reduction in violent crimes that hurt American citizens, if the U.S. is smart enough to legalize pot. Contention 3: Legalizing marijuana reduces or eliminates racial discrimination in law enforcement. It should be clear to the layperson that most marijuana arrests are against racial minorities, particularly blacks. A black individual is no more likely to use pot than a white person but, in Washington D.C., is over 8 times more likely to be arrested for it. This is what one could refer to as a Jim Crowe system; blacks suffer from mass incarceration much more than whites do, but they do not commit any more wrongdoings than whites. In order to provide for an American system of equality of opportunity and justice without regard to skin color, marijuana should be legalized. This will prevent irrationally suspicious police officers from locking up ""dangerous blacks"" (who, in truth, are not the least bit dangerous; they are just minding their own business); this racist enforcement is unethical, discriminatory, and clearly non-beneficial. Contention 4: Regulated marijuana is healthier marijuana. When alcohol was prohibited (i.e. before the 1920's), this led to an extensive black market whereby Americans still found ways to produce, purchase, and enjoy alcoholic beverages such as rum and beer. The same phenomenon occurs with marijuana. Even if marijuana is perceived to be dangerous, keeping it illegal does not deter its use. In fact, the criminal nature of cannabis provides a compelling reason for drug cartels to enter the country and sell cannabis, with no regard to whether the weed is tainted with dangerous chemicals like PCP. Since the illegality of marijuana fails to have any deterrent effect, legalizing pot will allow the government to closely control and regulate it. This allows for high-quality marijuana, meaning that consumers will enjoy marijuana that has no dangerous chemicals in it and that achieves standards of safety and health. This makes it a safer option. The influx of drug cartels is associated with the trade of weapons and also with violence, coercion, and sometimes murder. It is easier for a teenager to obtain a joint than it is for him to obtain a can of beer. Since Americans smoke pot regardless of whether or not it is legal, we should legalize it so that citizens purchase it from trusted, regulated dispensaries rather than untrustworthy, sketchy black-market dealers. Contention 5: Americans have freedom of choice. An American citizen should be able to do whatever she want, so long as her actions do not infringe upon the rights of others. Even if skeptics were successfully able to argue that smoking pot is harmful (which I would disagree with), Americans can choose to engage in harmful activities, as long as the others in society do not feel the effects of these choices. People are allowed to eat candy, drink beer, watch TV all day, and smoke cigarettes. Why should we limit the behavior of an individual simply due to archaic notions without any substantial evidence? Marijuana is used for a wide variety of medicinal and leisure purposes, and its effects have been described as uplifting, stress-relieving, and relaxing. To keep marijuana illegal is at variance with the pursuit of happiness that Thomas Jefferson had in mind when America was established as an independent nation. If individuals want to smoke pot, they should be able to do so, particularly in the privacy of their own homes. For many citizens, occasional marijuana use improves the quality of their lives and has medicinal benefits. Some who need it for medical use are too impoverished to afford to obtain a medical recommendation from their doctors, making their medicinal options severely limited. Keeping marijuana illegal is an invasion of privacy. In short, to legalize pot is to provide Americans with the freedoms of choice and discretion and the liberty that they deserve. I have posted evidence below that substantiates my claim. In short, the legalization of marijuana leads to benefits that address the economy, other crimes, racism, national safety, and the freedom of choice. These are all significant benefits that contribute to my proposed framework of ""net benefits"". A reason why keeping marijuana illegal is disadvantageous is equivalent to a reason why making marijuana legal is advantageous. Too many dollars are wasted in prohibition. Too many lives are locked up in prohibition. To many blacks and Hispanics are unfairly arrested in prohibition. Too many drug cartels enter the U.S. in prohibition. Finally, too many freedoms and basic liberties are violated in prohibition. For these reasons, the possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S. Please vote Pro. I await Con's contentions. https://www.drugpolicy.org... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://www.drugpolicy.org... http://www.rawstory.com... http://www.rollingstone.com... http://www.learnliberty.org... https://www.washingtonpost.com... http://www.collegiatetimes.com..."

S68c97443-A520b41b0	Marijuana should be legal for adults. (Debate sponsored by King La Ding Enterprises).	For my opening case I shall just ask questions that I require to be answered for no information was required in the opening case of the affirming. What is stopping children from accessing the drug and becoming addicted? What is stopping drug people from faking illnesses in order to get drugs legally? What is stopping people from growing the drug and selling it? e.g. what rules are you going to in place because in your setup you have told me nothing? If patients have it for medical purposes what stopping them from smoking it? Smoking it has life-threatening effects on your respiratory system. Marijuana has effects on your mental stability and health, you will have to influence laws for driving under marijuana? like will it be legal all of a sudden to drive while under influence of marijuana? So if people were to start smoking it for medical purposes will they have to do it in a special air tight room? Because we wouldn't want to hurt children's health. Also where would all this money come from? If it is released medically won't it eventually become available for public use? Do the negatives not outweigh the positives? Imagine if marijuana was legalised, everyone suddenly would think that it's some GOD drug and everyone will want to use it for their health even when there are better options available. Unfortunately marijuana has effects on health lots, life making men infertile. Will there be a system in place to prevent these problems? Do you not believe the release of marijuana will make us forget about trying to find other cures. It helps cure epileptic fits, so all of a sudden if you release this cure won't it prevent others from being developed. Others that would be less damaging to your health? Also where are you going to get millions of dollars for all of the costs for this medical marijuana. It will cause lots of problems with infertile men etc which will lead to the need of more money to fix these problems. It like alcohol. When you get drunk and fall over money is spent in getting you to safety via ambulance etc. Where will the money come for these extra facilities? Therefore I can conclude by asking you ladies and gentlemen to please look deeply into this case and realise that the negatives of legalising marijuana do outweigh the positives. Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe if this idea was to be brought forward in somewhat way the affirming team would struggle with the costs and the health of the people.	CON	63
S59d1f83c-Aa09e29b1	Marijuana should be legalized	"I'd like to thank my opponent for his excellent rebuttals. In this round, I will rebut my opponent's case and defend mine. Economic Benefit Marijuana has never raised any money in taxes anywhere when it's been legalised. His source only made an estimate based on current consumption patterns, without taking into account any of the costs of legalisation. I've already shown you the example of Amsterdam - you don't raise money with marijuana. As to the war not working, there are a lot of non-working expensive-to-enforce laws. For example, murder rates are on the increase in many countries, and catching murderers is certainly very expensive, but that's no reason to legalise murder. On creating jobs, what's often forgotten is that the marijuana industry already employs a lot of people - the figure just isn't reported. The only way the industry would create more jobs is if more people buy more cannabis. Trouble is, however, if people spend more money on cannabis, they won't have so much money to spend on other stuff, like food. That means that producers in other industries earn less money (negating any economic stimulus) and thus have to lay off staff (negating the hypothetical job gains). Holistically, the economy will lose production because of the extra sick days of smokers. More on that later. Personal Autonomy First, I don't accept the presumption that marijuana has no third-party harms, but I'll deal with that shortly. Second, the government regulates things all the time that don't harm others, such as the wearing of seatbelts or bicycle helmets, if there is a legitimate rational that the user may otherwise be in danger. The current cannabis policy is entirely consistent with that. Third, just because an answer is widespread doesn't mean it's justified. My opponent offered no justification as to why we're free to harm ourselves. Personal autonomy will always be tempered by our obligations as citizens, one of which is not to put ourselves into excessive amounts of danger (such as by smoking marijuana or not wearing seatbelts). As to consistency, that's a whole different debate. I'd gladly argue that the sale of alcohol and cigarettes should be much more restricted or outlawed some other time. Right now, we're arguing about what should be done with cannabis. Health Benefits It seems my opponent and I agree that pure THC should be legal (in fact, in many western jurisdictions it is). Great! THC, however, is not marijuana, which if anything causes more cancer than THC suppresses. My opponent's argument is like saying ""marijuana contains water, which has been proven to be good, so let's legalise marijuana."" That's illogical. Water can be procured from the tap, just as THC can be made in the lab. The advantage is that are there no other dangerous chemicals from marijuana mixed with the medicine. That's why proving water or THC to be good is a great argument for legalising water or THC, not marijuana! By the way, I also agree marijuana should be legal for research purposes, just not recreational or medical. As the example of Donald Tushkin proves, that's the status quo. I'm glad my opponent at least admits that there are an abundance of carcinogens in cannabis. As to the minor effects, such as pain relief, I've already stated cannabis can have a suppressive effect. Any trip to the pharmacy, however, will reveal that the world has no shortage of pain killers or nausea drugs. I agree Vioxx was a mistake, but millions of pain killers have worked with very little issue, such as Panadol and Neurofen. They probably won't give you cancer or mental issues either. To spare my opponent the trouble, yes overdosing is a problem, but the reason why people overdose is typically not because they're dumb, it's because they have some mental issue and feel a little suicidal. That's the problem we need to target. Often the reason for this mental issue, and therefore the problem, is marijuana. You don't need to legalise more drugs just because the few that are available are sometimes abused. On to self-medicating. My opponent didn't address this directly but he cast doubt on my sources for people who did self-medicate. On AIDS self-medicating patients, my opponent should note that AIDS is a type of immuno-deficiency, meaning the immune system IS already deficient. On cancer self-medicating patients, even if my study did not directly prove causation, a thirtyfold increase on tobacco (already known to be a leading cause of cancer) cannot really be mere coincidence. Individual Harms My opponent's right - 30,000 deaths is far too low, since I've already established cannabis is far worse than tobacco. If 1 in 10 cannabis users get schizophrenia, that's not a 'very small' number! That's a huge problem. That's 1.85% of the United States (extrapolating from pro's round 1 18.5% figure) getting mentally ill because of cannabis - not to mention the other mental issues cannabis can cause. That's about 5.5 million more mental patients burdening the USA's hospitals and, given the higher crime rates for people with mental problems, the USA's prisons. Can you really afford that? On addiction, I agree cannabis is less addictive than some other drugs, but as I've said whether or not we ban other drugs is a matter for another debate. Just because something is presently legal doesn't mean it should be! However, my opponent's chart only looked at physical addiction, dependence and tolerance. Note that my research is about mental addiction. And no, our brains haven't changed that much since 1984. Cannabis is highly mentally addictive, even if it isn't physically addictive. As to the education point, I wonder why my opponent thinks more school kids smoke tobacco than cannabis, even though both are illegal for young people? As I continuously reiterate - people do that which they are normalised to. I've also proven that normalisation starts in school. It doesn't matter whether he'd keep purchasing illegal, because his policy will hook more young people on cannabis anyway. Look at the Alaska example I sourced last round. My opponent said nothing about the gateway effect, other than to suggest my study was not sufficient evidence. First, it was enough for the British government statisticians to attribute it in their report. Second, I provided a strong logical basis for the figures that my opponent ignored. Family My opponent denies my source about sickness says anything about getting sick. Actually, yes it does (unless you don't count cancer etc as sickness). In addition, here is a report of a study that proved a 78% increase in absenteeism among marijuana users: http://www.nytimes.com.... On stealing money, here's the UK police saying marijuana users steal money and property to fuel their addiction: http://www.nidirect.gov.uk.... Here's an example: http://www.pottsmerc.com.... Society Legitimate traders would not benefit more then illegitimate - just look at all the real world examples I pointed to, like Amsterdam or Alaska. Who benefited more there? Why would we be any different? Marijuana is expensive enough as-is, and gangs aren't going to disappear just because you legalise their main source of income. As to property damage, the article I sourced cited dozens of studies showing property damage, but I guess voters can see that for themselves. On lobbying, no, that's just the drugs industry. Do we see political corruption around the kiwifruit industry, or the plaster industry? I thought not. At this point my opponent runs out of characters, so he clearly hasn't refuted all of my points. Out of fairness I'll offer no new points, so long as my opponent does try to tackle the remainder of my arguments, though I suspect it will be too little, too late."	CON	64
Sd42a9277-A9353832e	Marijuana should be legal all across the world	I have never disagreed with someone more than you. Explain why Marijuana is good! I personally think that possession of Marijuana is bad and should be a felony. And driving when your stoned is very unsafe and will kill someone, so it's nice to see your 'concern'. And it'll not make it easy for police officers to pull dead bodies away from deadly car crashes that have that God forsaken stench of pot. We all know that pot is good for medical use but that isn't what I thought this debate was about. 1. Marijuana can be used for good but I have seen first hand it being used for destruction in one's life. 2. It is a gateway drug, I know many who have overdosed on it and almost died, one did die. 3. I am not willing to ever support this, truly the best debater in the world would have to convince me.	CON	65

Marijuana has bad health effects Yes, drunk driving and texting while drive are issues, but that does not get away from the point that accidents will increase because of impairment caused by marijuana. I though I have proved there are many negative health effects that have been identified and well known, so to claim that there is a lack of information is simply incorrect. Fast food can be really bad for you, but it is food and you are not smoking it. You must have food to live but you don't have to smoke, so any comparison is really thin. It is true that fast food and marijuana don't have the same effect, which is more reason why it isn't a good comparison. 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral It is not extremism; it is called reductio ad absurdum. That is the refutation of a proposition by demonstrating that its logical conclusion is absurd. [1] Your argument was this X should be legal because it does not harm anyone else. I just simply filled in options that would also be true under the same argument. It is the logical conclusion of that argument. You must assume that all those acts are consensual or there would be harm, but if two consenting parties agree to cannibalism/dualing would that be immoral? As you said ""It is our freedom to choose for ourselves."" ""Because people have such drastically different views on what is wrong and right it should be left up to the individual."" Again your argument is people have different moral opinions regarding X; therefore, the individual should choose to do it or not. Well what if my morality allowed abortion, human sacrifice, or stealing? Pertaining to the butterfly effect, it can be see as true like this. Way back in 1941 Hitler made the single choice to invade the USSR. As a result he lost the war and we have the world like it today, but if He chooses to make the opposite design our world would be very far away from the one we have. However at the time the decision was made it didn't make that much of a difference. You can think of today too. If we have the cure for cancer tomorrow we will start to cure people but overall not much has changed, but in 50 years there is now more people living than would have and is significantly different than a world without the cure. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it Capone did deal with alcohol bootlegging, but most of his power came from the casinos that the mob operated. [2] There is indeed a reason prohibition was lifted, and it was lack of enforcement ""Undercover police officers were trying to do their jobs, but the available manpower was still tiny in comparison with the thriving industry. Even when arrests were made, corruption made it nearly impossible to convict anyone. For example, during one time period more than 7,000 arrests were made in New York for alcohol violations, and only 17 of those ended in conviction. Many states eventually grew tired of the hassle. In fact, by 1925 six states had developed laws that kept police from investigating infractions. Cities in the Midwest and Northeast were particularly uninterested in enforcing Prohibition "" [3] As far as never be tried again, there are numerous counties that are dry. ""Nearly half of Mississippi's counties are dry. Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, Kansas and Virginia also have a large proportion of dry counties. Kentucky isn't much better for alcohol lovers. Thirty counties are wet and 55 are bone-dry."" [4] As far as crime dropping, there are less people committing criminal acts. An example is there is 10 people 1 person is a marijuana user (criminal) and 2 people are other criminals. This means there is 30% crime rate, but if you legalize marijuana then the crime rate drops to 20%. Nothing changed besides how you classified that person. 5. Drug related arrest benefit society A billion dollars sounds like a lot but it isn't. Also Excise taxes are not good for raising revenue. In 2012 the tobacco tax, the most revenue raising excise tax, raised about 17 billion dollars [5] and the federal budget was 3.5 Trillion [2], so that tax is about 0.5% of the federal budget. As I have shown legalization would increase crime, and has a mass of bad health effects. Increased crime and increased health issues will only hurt the economy. As for my 12 source, it is on page 6. I agree rehabilitation would be better, and that is what we should focus on. 6. Legalization of marijuana will lead to the legalization of other drugs Many arguments made for the legalization of marijuana can be used to argue the legalization of harder drugs like heroin. As an example, many say marijuana should be legal because it is less harmful than alcohol; however, so are many other drugs including crack, meth, and heroin. [6] Also, saying things like ""it is my choice"" which could be said about any drug. Sources [1] http://www.thefreedictionary.com... [2] http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu...

S59d2039e-Ab417f6ae	Marijuana should be legalized	"Thank you, instigator, for your arguments My opponent and I agreed on the debate structure in the comments. However, I must object to some of the points made in the structure of the debate. I think it will be more effective and conventional for both of us if we could list our sources beforehand and have the final round waived, rather than cited sources in the end. How else am I supposed to be convinced of the validity of your sources and that you haven't plagiarized, I believe this will save us a lot of time and will organize our debate for the better. I hope you consider my offer, but since this is your debate, I'll go along with your flow. Anyway, let's begin! =Preface= I'll begin my debate with a couple of observations and definition of terms. I'll as well explain the (counter)plan of my debate. Now, I'll note that I'm for the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, but I'm against it recreationally. Though, I still agree that they should limit it as a medical substance. =Observation= Obs1: Since this is not a normative resolution because Pro affirms a change in the status quo, the burden will be on Pro to show the beneficial impact on the recreational / and or medicinal use of marijuana in the U.S. In order for Con to win, Con must successfully negate most of Pro's contentions, this is Con's main duty in this debate. Con must also provide evidence to substantiate marijuana's negative side-effects and the consequences of those side effects; therefore, this will prove that the complete legalization will hurt the U.S. instead of helping it. =Framework= My framework will focus on the premises that the legalization of recreational marijuana will not deter the crime rate and will not mitigate the trade of marijuana on the black market. Also, marijuana and its effects on the body will also be an important argument. Definitions Crime rate (ucradatatool.gov) - ""An offense rate, or crime rate, defined as the number of offenses per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing a jurisdiction's population by 100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure."" Deter (dictionary.com)- ""discourage (someone) from doing something by instilling doubt or fear of the consequences."" To be more explicit, I'm going to provide evidence to deduce that the legalization of marijuana will increase the crime rate of America and will not stop the black market from dealing it. Also, since my opponent hasn't specified the type of use--medicinal or recreational--I'll be focusing more on recreational, since it's not part of the legal status quo of the US. Rebuttals/Contentions: C1 - Health Impacts: Even though marijuana has lesser dramatic effects than other drugs listed in schedule I, marijuana can devastatingly affect the human brain. Firstly, let's start off easy. Marijuana is undeniably a heavily addictive substance. People who smoke it (particularly underage groups who have higher risks and are more inclined to abusing the drug) find it difficult to focus and concentrate, that's the essence / softer side effects of the substance. Studies also show that marijuana can cause memory loss and deteriorate one's learning abilities as well (this is the consequence of cognitive decline marijuana leads to). Due to marijuana's increase in its THC dosage over the past decade, habitual smokers are more inclined to developing psychosis or schizophrenia. Currently, an average THC dosage you'll be able to find in marijuana will be around 9% or higher, however, 25% is the highest you'll be able to find. It's usually smuggled from Canada or Mexico. This is an incredibly high dosage, taking into consideration that it used to be only 3% (1). Aside from the mental effects, marijuana can also deteriorate the physical state of the body. For example, chronic bronchitis is usually the most common illnesses marijuana can cause, and that's because it impairs the airways and cell linings. However, aspergillus--a mold leading to lung impairment--is also the lead cause of chronic marijuana use, that is if you have a weak immune system. But aside from the lungs, studies show that the immune system is also under threat because of the substance (2). Even though the research on this topic is limited, researchers still have reasons to believe that marijuana causes cancer. Frankly, it doesn't come as a surprise since marijuana has over 50 ingredients (some of which are carcinogenic), and many of them are yet to be thoroughly evaluated. One carcinogen that researchers have studied is benzpyrene and THC; benzpyrene is also found in cigarettes. Now, these ingredients are known to alter a certain kind of gene (p53-'tumor suppressor gene'), which when altered, may inhibit cancer. 75% of people who were diagnosed with lung cancer have a defective p53 gene (3). Another study found that the chemicals in marijuana accelerate the production ""myeloid-derived suppressor cells"", weakening the immune system. This experiment tested THC on rats. Rats with higher dosages had more of those cells produced. Researchers then deduced that because of this, THC leads to cancer growth, and even weakens the process of cancer therapy. Because instead of the immune system fighting the cancer cells, these suppressors activate cells that interact with marijuana's cannabinoids. Nevertheless, there was a mild concession that THC does have beneficial effects when treating certain types of diseases, but due to the limited research, if 'weed' truly does help treat cancer is still a subject for debate (4). C2 - Crime rate: This contention will be split into 2 sub-arguments. Sub-argument 1 - Crime rate: Let's face it without offending anyone, if you suffer from an addiction to any substance (be it alcohol or marijuana), you'll do anything to acquire that substance. Even though marijuana supporters try to cover this up and twist the story around, Colorado's crime rate has surged ever since a big marijuana conglomerate planted its roots there. However, marijuana sale is strictly regulated. People cannot buy more than an ounce of marijuana unless they have a prescription. Also, all marijuana products' potency is tested, meaning that there are certain THC levels the product must meet before being sold. Even though this company helped create jobs, the police are feeling that people are getting out of hand. More and more people were stopped because of driving under the influence of the drug [Fact: 10 million people reported they drove under the influence of drugs in 2014 - the most common drug that people were influenced by was marijuana (5)]. Dr. Larry Wolk, head of the public health department in Colorado said more and more people are being admitted to hospitals because of nausea triggered by the drug (6). The crime rate in Denver increased by 10% in 2015. The state's district attorney George Brauchler talked about the syllogism between the 2 entities on television, ""That's not what you'd expect. You'd expect the harder-core drugs."" ... ""If cash is the only way to acquire marijuana, crime follows cash"". He firmly believed marijuana is the culprit (8). In DC, after the legalization, violence increased by 15% in 2016. Over the year, homicides reached to 54%, all after marijuana was introduced (7). And frankly, it doesn't surprise me a bit. A study done by the University of Cambridge found that marijuana triggers violent behavior. Out of 411 male subjects born in 1953, 22% of them developed violent behavior after becoming chronic smokers (9). Sub-argument 3 - Prohibition: My opponent compares marijuana prohibition to the prohibition era. Now, to address this, marijuana and alcohol are two separate substances that are in no way comparable with each other. Firstly, alcohol and marijuana differ in the way they affect the human body and the brain, the symptoms are very dissimilar. Surely, marijuana may be healthier, but people who smoke it are more inclined to committing crime; it's a drug that has greater ties to crime (12). Excluding tax being placed on 'legalized marijuana', people are still satisfied, thinking that this might help end the War on Drugs. The truth is it is no different than before, dealers are still dealing. In fact, it's safe to assume that most of them might have products with higher potency and cheaper prices. The writer of the article put it well: ""The same faces standing on the same corners. The same neighborhoods cruised by the same cops. The same cautious side-to-side look before a thickly flowered stem is removed from a backpack, peered at closely, maybe smelled and rolled between the fingers, and, in a quick change of hands, finally sold"" (11). =Fruther refutations and conclusion= People used to use psychedelic drugs, cocaine, and heroin as medicine. Cocaine was used to treat headaches and used as an anesthetic during surgeries (10). Hell, cocaine used to be once legal, but this doesn't act as an excuse to relegalize it, doesn't it? Surely, you could argue that it's much safer to smoke marijuana than cocaine, I concur. But, look at the psychological effects these two drugs have on the brain. Alcohol, just like marijuana is regulated very strictly. Where I come from, you can't drink alcohol on the streets or buy it after 10 PM. In Netherlands, smoking marijuana is disallowed in public areas, only in cafe shops and other special areas permitting it. Essentially, smoking marijuana on the streets is illegal in Netherlands. However in the US, since people are deceived into thinking that marijuana is safer, they start committing traffic offenses, like driving under the influence of the drug. More people drive drunk than under the influence of alcohol. -Challenge answer next round Sources: [1]:http://bit.ly...; [2]:http://bit.ly...; [3]:http://bit.ly...; [4]:http://bit.ly...; [5]:http://bit.ly...; [6]:http://bit.ly...; [7]:http://bit.ly...

Employees should be allowed to use marijuana on the job as long as they are not public officials/servants (i.e. policemen, firemen), teachers, drivers (i.e. bus drivers, taxi drivers), or medical workers. People who do not work in these fields should be allowed to use marijuana because they are not endangering anyone when high. *This is for a school debate over whether marijuana should be legalized for all residents over the age of 18.

S59d1fcd6-A41fb79b4	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana has bad health effects The vast majority of people that already use marijuana don't go out just getting high where ever they feel like it. They are ordinary people that use it in the privacy of the own homes. Those that you do see using it irresponsibly are almost entirely teenagers and people in their early twenties. Its because young people have not matured enough to be trusted to use a substance such as alcohol hence the requirement being 21. Yes you have to have food to survive but not unhealthy food. Its a choice that you make, whether to eat healthy or not. Why is smoking it a problem? When in a hospital you can be given medication through a needle which is a common means of delivery to an addict. Delivery is not a means to determine whether its wrong or immoral. If marijuana did actually have even moderate side effects they would not prescribe it to treat over 230 illnesses. Its prescribed to treat more things than any other drug known to medicine except antibiotics. 3. Use of marijuana is immoral That was the problem, the examples you gave were not logical in the first place so the conclusion of the scenario would be equally illogical. As for your example of cannibalism, that is on the other end of the moral spectrum. Though it has happened before Hannibal isn't exactly a figure people are eager to copy and attempt to legalize. People are allowed to donate their body to science and have their organs on display in a museum and this caused a major controversy with many people. They believed it to be immoral for someone to allow their body to be defiled in a such a way but despite the objections it was determined that it was the right of the individual to do with their body what they want. Suppose abortion was legalized, that doesn't force anyone to have it done and besides that it involves the life of someone that cannot defend nor make any objection. The child is completely and utterly at the mercy of its mother. These examples are too extreme! Your talking about lives being taken in brutal ways. Stealing is deemed immoral because your imposing your will unto others. Marijuana is not something that affects other people (unless you smoke it around someone without their permission) You keep bringing up things that involve harming other people. The butterfly effect is an impossible theory to prove because there is no way to know what triggered a situation to happen. It could literally be caused from anything. If someone had a impulse to go some place they never had an interest in they could be in the wrong place at the wrong time and end up being hit by a car and killed but if they had not had the impulse they wouldn't have went to the place and still be alive. It is an impossibly unpredictable theory. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it [2] ""the available manpower was still tiny in comparison with the thriving industry"" By your own words you described why prohibition cannot work. Our government is throwing trillions of dollars and thousands of lives at the war on drugs and yet its rapidly loosing support as the videos ive provided have shown. Corruption is a virulent problem especially today! They are uninterested in enforcing prohibition because they know it is a fight they cannot hope to win and they are just wasting lives and money. [4] Criminals are going to commit crimes no matter what drug they might use. That's why they're called criminals. Simply smoking marijuana does not make someone to criminal things so to be fair 10% of your statistic had done nothing criminal accept using marijuana while 20% had actually committed a crime. If marijuana were to be legalized the crime rate would drop substantially because simply using marijuana is considered a crime. Actual crimes such as rape, murder, and stealing are crimes, using a substance in the privacy of your own home or establishment is not a crime. You said yourself ""Nothing changed besides how you classified that person"" In other words legalizing it would not make matters worse. Using marijuana doesn't make people want to go out and commit serious crimes. 5. Drug related arrest benefit society A billion isn't a lot? Tax payers would disagree. If marijuana were taxed the same way you could have substantial profits. That was just Florida, suppose the other 49 states spent a billion each that's 50 billion. That's money that could substantially benefit something like the education system or the medical field. Just because its not the majority of the federal budget doesn't mean that its not a massive waste of money. You have not shown that crime would increase, you can predict that it might increase but there is no way to prove crime would increase. The only thing you can prove is that if it were legalized all those that were using it illegally would no longer be a part of the criminal statistic. Crime statistic therefore goes down. 6. Legalization of marijuana will lead to the legalization of other drugs Crack, meth, and heroin are not less harmful than alcohol they are among the most highly addictive substances there are with the most detrimental health effects. Many politicians and law enforcement are pushing to have drugs legalized altogether because of the utter failure of prohibition. I provided those sources earlier in the debate. I personally don't care to have any other drug legalized but can admit that it would save the American taxpayers a literal fortune. Portugal is a great example of how complete legalization can benefit a country. Since they legalized all drugs the crime rates dropped drastically. P.S.

S59d1fcd6-Ad57380f7	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is a gateway I don't feel as if you refuted the basic argument here. You did claim that it might not be the first pick of drugs, but that doesn't mean it is not a gateway. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects Also the base claim here that marijuana has a multitude of bad health effects is not refuted. You cannot link fast food to marijuana because they have different effects. Fast food is bad for you, but it doesn't distort perception, or other direct medical effects like marijuana does. They are both unhealthy, but they are bad in different ways. Why is smoking a problem, because it causes direct harm to the self, and others right around it. Someone eating a cheeseburger next to you isn't going to affect your health. Many drugs have very serious side effects, but they are still prescribed by doctors. Just because it has side effects doesn't mean it won't be prescribed. 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral As for cannibalism, lives are not being taken away in brutal ways. If someone dies and their final wish is for people to consume their body it is no different than people donating their body to science. After all it is the ""right of the individual to do with their body what they want."" As for abortion I said according to some people it is true, apparently neither of us think that way. You then say ""Marijuana is not something that affects other people (unless you smoke it around someone without their permission)"" which isn't true. There is something called Third-hand smoke, which is ""Third-hand smoke is a term used to describe the particles and gases that are left over after a cigarette is extinguished. These particles land and remain on virtually any surface in an area where someone has smoked -- on clothes, in hair, on furniture and on flooring."" [1] Third-hand smoke has been shown to be especially dangerous to children. [2] Smoking anything is more harmful than to just that person who is smoking. The butterfly effect is similar to the origin of the first life. It is a historical science meaning it is not something you can use the scientific method for since it is not repeatable. No one can prove how the first life occurred, just like no one can prove the butterfly effect. Both of these are based on philosophy, current evidence, or reasoning. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it Actually I showed why Alcohol prohibition eventually failed; however, it was a success in many other ways. The War on drugs is not a failure. Monitoring the Future Study: Trends in Prevalence of Various Drugs Drugs that have decreased in use (2010-2013) among 12th graders: Alcohol, Cigarettes, Smokeless Tobacco, Cocaine, Crack Cocaine, GHB, Hallucinogens, LSD, MDMA, Heroin, Inhalants, Ketamine, Methamphetamine, PCP, Ritalin, Narcotics other than Heroin, Vicodin, OxyContin, and Rohypnol. 19 drugs. Drugs that have increased in use (2010-2013) among 12th graders: Marijuana, Amphetamine, and Adderall. 3 drugs. [3] In 1978 daily use of marijuana use of 12 graders was about 11%, and in 2013 is is about 6%. [4] That is a decrease of about 45%. Portugal crime rate has not changed much and actually shows an increase of reported crimes. [5] The immediate effect is nothing changed but how you classify people, but the long term effects show a correlation between marijuana use and crime as I have shown in previous rounds. 5. Drug related arrest benefit society It equals about $50 per person in Florida. There is an inverse correlation between the incarceration rate and the crime rate. [6] The more the prison population is the less crime there is. Crime is also on a decrease according to Gallup. [7] 6. Legalization of marijuana will lead to the legalization of other drugs ""The British peer-reviewed journal Lancet published a study titled ""Drug Harms in the UK: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis"" on Nov. 1, 2010 which ranked 20 drugs from alcohol to marijuana to tobacco based on harm factors."" They found Alcohol to be the most harmful. [8] You further prove my point by saying that they want to legalize drugs all together. Meaning that it will lead to legalization of things like heroin.

Also could you elaborate on why policemen, firemen, teachers, drivers, or medical workers can not use marijuana? When using the term anyone, does this include the person using marijuana? Additionally, the topic states, ""Employees may use marijuana on the job except if it could pose a threat to the public."" whereas in one's claim it states, ""should be allowed to use marijuana because they are not endangering anyone."" So is the argument that they should be allowed to use marijuana as long as they are not hurting anyone including themselves, coworkers, and the public, or strictly just the public? Also when stating ""employees on the job"" do you mean they can use marijuana on breaks or while working or both? People at work should not be allowed to use marijuana because in any case it is a threat (threat: a person or thing likely to cause damage or danger). As stated by the National Institute of Drug Abuse the short term effects of marijuana are altered senses, altered sense of time, changes in mood, impaired body movement, difficulty with thinking and problem-solving, and impaired memory. Any of these side effects could create a situation that endangers anyone, for example take a sandwich shop employee who is not a public official, teacher, driver, or medical worker. If this sandwich maker experiences impaired body movement and difficulty thinking, while slicing the bread they could cut their finger. If they damage their finger then they are a threat to themselves. Based upon the effects of marijuana, it does create a danger to anyone including oneself. Therefore, marijuana should not be used while at work regardless of the profession. This is the link to the National Institute of Drug Abuse https://www.drugabuse.gov...

S59d1f83c-A146cc15	Marijuana should be legalized	"I can look forward to debating such a fine opponent as Lars is. I ask that he refrain from making rebuttals in his opening argument, for it would unbalance the debate. Rebuttals will be made in the 3rd round. I apologize for not clarifying this earlier. I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana in three contentions, and they are: C1. Economic Benefit C2. Personal Autonomy C3. Health Benefit Good luck! Economic Benefit The war on drugs. This is a war that sees no end, no progress, yet constantly leeches billions to be funneled into numerous programs and enforcement of prohibition. Legalizing cannabis (marijuana) would accrue $8.7 billion in savings [1]. That's money that was solely spent through the war on drugs on containing marijuana, which hasn't been done. In 2002, 17.3% of adults aged 18-25 smoked marijuana. In 2010, of that same group, 18.5% smoked marijuana [2]. The war on marijuana doesn't seem to be working; legalizing marijuana would get rid of the facade that these programs are deterring anyone from using, and it will save us billions. Oddly enough, another $8.7 billion dollars is to be had through tax revenues from legalizing marijuana [1]. That's a total of $17.4 billion dollars we can save by legalizing cannabis. This isn't to mention the amount of people and families it will put to work. The marijuana industry would be a enormous one; growing, shipping, distributing, researching, etc. In California alone, the industry would be expected to create 50,000 jobs at around $1.4 billion in wages [3]. Finding stats on the amount of jobs marijuana would create is difficult, seeing as it's illegal, but if we take the 50K and multiply it by 50 (number of states) then subtract 10,000 for each state (pretty rough math, but Cali. is a big state. Some would create more jobs, others less.), then we are left with a number of jobs in between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000. That's that many less impoverished families, with that much more money (approx. $70 billion) to be commercially spent, thus stimulating the economy to a great extent. Personal Autonomy Marijuana use is illegal in the eyes of the government, but what if you feel differently? Even if you don't, is it O.K. as a third person to take away someone's right and freedom to partake in any activity they wish, as long as it doesn't hurt another individual's rights? The most widespread answer would be no, it's not alright. Freedom is what this country was found upon, and laws that prohibit that freedom are unjust and unconstitutional; marijuana use doesn't impose on the rights of others, so why make it illegal? Alcohol is legal, and I would argue that that heavily imposes on other's rights. Drunk driving alone causes the deaths of too many innocent individuals, yet you can get alcohol in probably every small town in this country. We can see a lack of consistency within our government, and it's time to change that. Think of it this way....members of the Ku Klux Klan are allowed to meet and discuss how white's are supreme and probably trash talk local African-Americans, and that's totally legal. Yet, once you take a puff of that cheba, you are a villain and are put under arrest. Does this make a whole lot of sense? A drug that literally has killed nobody is illegal, while congregating to express racism isn't. While I agree that the latter should remain legal, it's silly to think that marijuana should remain illegal with things way worse going on. Health Benefits Widely thought is that marijuana is harmful to your body. The opposite is actually true. It is concluded that marijuana doesn't attribute to cancer growth or development, but rather hinders it and protects one from cancer. Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years, stated to the Washington Post that his latest, largest to date survey of it's kind found no correlation between cancer and marijuana, and stated that ""marijuana also contains the chemical THC which...may kill aging cells and keep them from becoming cancerous."" [4] Think of the potentiality of marijuana and the chemicals it contains; keeping it illegal means keeping further research of these chemicals and their effects illegal. We need to legalize marijuana in order to develop further stages of cancer treatments through THC. Not only is it helpful in cancer situations, where cancer cells actually die when exposed to cannabis [5], but cannabis is relieving in a variety of facets. ""Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the laboratory and the clinic for relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite"" [5] |Conclusion| It's simply myopic at this point to frown upon the legalization of marijuana. It's variety of uses combined with the revenue it would bring in shines above and beyond any possible risk it imposes. All of this is unnecessary in providing a case for marijuana, however, because Personal Autonomy rules over all else. As long as you aren't imposing on another individual's rights, you are free to do what you will. On a personal level, it's not the job of the government to limit you. They should not be allowed to tell you you can't buy a certain plant any more than they can tell you you can't buy a certain bread. The thought is ludicrous. The definition of should has been met through my case. ""Should- indicating a desirable or expected state."" Those who try to argue that marijuana's benefits are not desirable are clearly not looking at the facts. I urge the readers to keep reading on! Favorite the debate! Keep up with it!

""It's clear what will happen if my opponent has his way, just like the cigarette companies, their will be marijuana companies making their product irresistible by lacing it with addictive substances"" -How is this clear? Marijuana on the street is marketed by it's potency, purity, strain, and organic growth techniques like hydroponics. This concept makes absolutely no sense. Cigarettes require an addictive substance because they otherwise serve no use whatsoever. Furthermore, the organic substance in cigarettes- though added in larger quantities by some companies- is naturally occurring in tobacco. There are no naturally occurring addictive substances in marijuana. ""people will become slaves to it and loose great sums of money that could be used in MUCH more productive ways"" -According to what? Making unsubstantiated claims does not make for honest and/or logical debate. 'My opponent will probably say, ""well, we'll just let people grow it""' -The growth of marijuana in modest quantities for personal use is a concept I fully support. ""and that's a great idea, put it right in the open for all the youth to get a hold of and become pot heads."" -That's a deductive fallacy. First off, I am not supporting the growth of marijuana in the living room. Responsible adults should have the sense to keep live marijuana plants in a place where they can grow healthy- this is usually out of anyone but the grower's reach or view. Second, the presence of live marijuana plants is not motivation for anyone who is not already a pothead to become one. Third, responsible adults will educate their children. As with alcohol and guns, ownership or presence of these in your home does not mean your child will be a killer or an alcoholic. ""Stats show that smoking marijuana leads youths to try worse drugs like crack cocaine"" -That's not true. In fact, recent trends suggest that a rise in marijuana use has coincided with a decline in hard drug use http://www.monitoringthefuture.org... http://www.monitoringthefuture.org... ""eventual death"" -There is not one recorded marijuana death in it's 8,000 plus year history, yet thousands of people die annually from prescription drugs, alcohol, cigarettes... even from eating too much McDonald's. http://drugwarfacts.org... ""Once people are addicted, they will do anything to get that drug for their ""high"", this is why we see so many addicts resorting to theft to get money to pay for their drugs."" -This has absolutely nothing to do with marijuana. ""I don't see a benefit for society by legalizing marijuana"" -I will name a few: 1. 44.3% of non-violent criminals arrested in 2008 for possession were arrested for possession of marijuana for personal use. http://www.fbi.gov... This accounted for a total of 429,605 arrests. Using 2005 numbers for the cost (which one would expect would have risen in 2008), that accounts for a total of 4.5 Billion dollars. http://www.norml.org... The legalization of marijuana for personal use would free up this money to use in other areas of law enforcement, or drug treatment and prevention. 2. The US spends about 50 Billion dollars a year to fight drugs. About 50% of drug offenses prosecuted in the US are related to marijuana. Legalization could save the government about 25 Billion per year. http://www.drugsense.org... 3. Legalization in California alone has the potential of earning the state 1.2 Billion in taxes, and upwards of 12 Billion dollars annually in associated income from the legal regulated sale of marijuana. http://www.canorml.org... Over 500 economists, some Nobel Laureates, agree- http://economics.about.com... 4. Illegal grows can harm the environment. There are benefits to the environment in legal, government regulated grow operations. http://www.recordnet.com... 5. 14 Billion dollars per year are generated for Mexican drug cartels through the sale of marijuana. Legalization would strip a great deal of that money away from the cartels, and proceeds from the legal sale of marijuana, taxation, and other fees can be used to support law enforcement in other ways. http://www.alternet.org... Marijuana has the same effect on law enforcement, and underground society that prohibition of alcohol did. Figures like Al Capone would not have been so popular, so financially successful, or so dangerous had alcohol been legal in their time. Only hardened criminals benefit from prohibition. 6. Marijuana has been proven to have positive effects on the following diseases: Crohn's Disease AIDS/ HIV Glaucoma Multiple Sclerosis Epilepsy Scoliosis Fibromyalgia And other chronic diseases and ailments. The largest organized group of doctors in the US, The American Medical Association (AMA), has recently urged the US government to reconsider scheduling of marijuana. http://www.latimes.com... 7. Many drugs currently prescribed for diseases that can be treated by marijuana are far more toxic, and far more dangerous. Legalization of marijuana can save thousands of lives lost to these drugs. http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org... I await my opponent's response."	PRO	77

S59d1fcd6-A417ec316	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is a gateway Whether or not its a gateway is up to the person that takes it since there are no addictive properties. People are curious creatures by nature so its safe to say if people want to try one drug they are going to try another regardless of which one they start with. Since there are no addictive properties in marijuana it is peoples curiosity that pushes them to try other drugs the same curiosity that drove them to try marijuana. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects I have refuted and proven there are no negative health effects in every post. It relieves headaches, nausea, pain, and its far more pure than any prescription drug humans make. You say we cannot link marijuana and fast food but it was used as a method of comparing negative health effects. Marijuana has far less than fast food. Yes it does distort you perception but when used responsibly there is nothing wrong with that. It distorts far less than alcohol which is legal. The vast majority of people that use marijuana never get into any trouble unless they drive because it is a drug that puts one into a calm state. Hence the slow hippy ish type behavior seen as typical. While it does distort it does not inhibit ones perception of right and wrong no matter how much they use but that is not the case with alcohol. I am speaking from a lifetime of experience growing up around people that used marijuana on a regular basis. If marijuana is so unhealthy why is it used in over 230 illnesses the vast majority of which are not terminal or severe. You claim that it causes direct harm to oneself but 1. What people put in their own body is none of anyones business 2. No one should be able to use it in a public setting where people who don't want to be around it might be unless the establishment has deemed its use on the property acceptable much like a bar allows cigarettes. Someone smoking marijuana in their home isn't going to affect someone outside the home. The users of marijuana have seen the benefits and choose the drug because of the lack of health side effects. They have not proven any negative health effects. There hasn't been anyone that came forward saying ""Marijuana ruined my health!"" There are healing properties in the drug some of which believed to cure cancer hence the billions being spent studying it for a cure! There are reports of people diagnosed with a tumor in their brain and went through every option only to have them fail. But then they tried a hemp oil and their tumor started to decrease, it saved their lives when the prescription meds failed them. I provided these testimonials in previous videos. These are ordinary people that can see the potentials of one of the worlds most natural drugs. 3. Use of Marijuana is immoral You said it yourself third hand smoke is a term used to describe the particles and gases that are left over after a CIGARETTE is extinguished. All three of the links ive provided say absolutely nothing about marijuana. Third hand smokes seems to pertain specifically to cigarettes which as we all know is pumped full of harmful chemicals while marijuana is not.

Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it Whether it was somewhat of a success since they deemed it not to be effective enough to keep in effect. All the evidence I provided in previous rounds have proven the opposite to be true on drug consumption hence all the politics and law enforcement trying to do away with prohibition. You claim that Portugal has had an increase in crimes but provided no evidence other than your claim. You should actually watch all these videos they are very educational.

S59d1fcd6-A48422696	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is a gateway Yes cigarettes can be a gateway too, but I advocate for banning those too. "" It is estimated that 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it. The number goes up to about 1 in 6 in those who start using young (in their teens) and to 25-50 percent among daily users."" [1] Your comment of ""Many of today's youth turn to selling drugs and the prescription drugs have taken hold of the drug market because of the high one can experience and the price is drastically higher than any other drug."" fits really well with my previous comment of ""Because a tolerance builds up, marijuana can lead users to consume stronger drugs to achieve the same high."" You basically validated my claim that it is a gateway drug. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects Those studies say directly caused or responsible for meaning they were the main cause of the accident. "". A recent survey found that 6.8 percent of drivers, mostly under age 35, who were involved in accidents tested positive for THC; alcohol levels above the legal limit were found in 21 percent of such drivers."" [5] 5% isn't insignificant you are talking about hundreds of lives. Also, Alcohol does contribute to many deaths also, but I also favor banning alcohol too. ""There has been no evidence to show that marijuana has taken a single life."" really? In the previous round I showed that ""researchers estimated that at least 2.5 percent of the 10,748 fatal crashes studied were directly caused by the use of marijuana."" [4] Yes Marijuana may help with some diseases, but we are not talking about just medical marijuana. This is about all marijuana like for recreational use. 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral My opponent offers his version of morality which is referred to as the Harm principle which is ""As long as the action involves only consenting adults it is morally permissible."", but I don't believe this is really how he would determine morality. Irving Kristol wrote an argument to this saying ""[T]he plain fact is that none of us is a complete civil libertarian. We all believe that there is some point at which the public authorities ought to step in to limit the ""self-expression"" of an individual or group even where this might be seriously intended as a form of artistic expression, and even where the artistic transaction is between consenting adults. A playwright or theatrical director might, in this crazy world of ours, find someone willing to commit suicide on stage, as called for by the script. We would not allow that-any more than we would permit scenes of real physical torture on the stage, even if the victim were a willing masochist. And I know of no one, no matter how free in spirit, who argues that we ought to permit gladiatorial contests in Yankee stadium, similar to those once performed in the Coliseum of Rome-even if only consenting adults were involved."" [2] If this is really does believe this then All Drugs & Alcohol, Euthanasia/Suicide, Prostitution, Polygamy, Gay Marriage, Cannibalism, Bestiality, Incest, Public Nudity, Abortion (According to some people), Dueling/Fights to the Death, All weapons of any kind be owned should all be legal and is morally permissible; however I felt that I have shown that it does harm to health and others. This is a consequentialist theory because you judge the morality of an action based on its consequences; However, this is not a good way to determine right and wrong. This is because you can never know the full consequences of an action. A small action today could lead to major actions later, this is known as the butterfly effect. ""The butterfly effect is the sensitive dependency on initial conditions in which a small change at one place in a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state."" [3] What an action is today a small ""harmless"" action could lead to world peace, or it could also lead to World War III you can never know. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it I didn't say that you wanted to legalize it for children. I did say legalizing makes it easier for children to get it. ""It is common knowledge that prohibition does not work."" It should say it is commonly misunderstood that prohibition didn't work. During Prohibition there were significant positive effects. ""Alcohol use decreased, cirrhosis of the liver was down 66% in men, and public drunkenness was halved."" [6] Also increased savings, better provided and happier homes, and responsible citizenship. [7] Prohibition did work, but it was poorly enforced in some areas which lead to its repeal. There is still a multitude of counties that are still dry. [8] As far as crime related to prohibition ""“Yes,” asserts Sabet, “organized crime was emboldened, but the mob was already powerful before Prohibition, and it continued to be long after.” So I see no strong evidence that Prohibition wasn’t temporarily useful to America"" [6], and ""Probably one of the most popular ideas of the time was that the mob held control of the majority of the illegal liquor trafficking. For the most part this is untrue, although in concentrated areas gangsters did run the liquor racket. Chicago was one of those cities where they did control distribution."" [9] I also like your distinct lack of sources for this section. 5. Drug related arrest benefit society Someone who illegally buys/sell/uses marijuana has already established themselves as someone who does not follow the law, and could lead to more crimes in the future; however, if they are in jail on drug charges they cannot commit more crimes. Also, they would get a lighter sentence than others crimes. [10]""Marijuana is the drug most often linked to crime in the United States"" [11] ""In a study of 10,441 secondary students in New South Wales, Australia, students who were frequent cannabis users were two times more likely to participate in assault and malicious damage of property than students who did not use cannabis."" [12] We can focus on rehabilitation on why they turned to drugs instead waiting for them to do more crimes, and incarcerating them for longer times.

Sc0722593-A312fafce	Marijuana should be legalized for both Medicinal and Recreational use	"Hello, and thanks to Pro for giving me the opportunity to debate this important issue. I will begin by stating my contention. Growing marijuana, possessing marijuana, and using marijuana for recreational use (medical marijuana should be legal) should remain illegal, but the penalties for each of these violations should be altered drastically. This is a much more reasonable policy than full legalization. I would like to begin by stating that I agree entirely and will not attempt to refute many of the claims I anticipate that my opponent will make. I agree that marijuana has been proven to be an effective treatment for pain, that THC has been adequately proven not to have a direct adverse effect on the human body, and that the United States' policy on drugs is completely ineffective and has made no progress whatsoever towards their goal. If my opponent would like to present any other traditional arguments against the illegality of marijuana, chances are quite high that I will agree with them. However, Pro should not be disinclined to present them - just know that we are probably on the same page on 90% of issues concerning marijuana. I will now give overviews of how laws concerning marijuana should be changed, and the reasoning behind why it should not be fully legalized. I will not extensively cite sources, as this is an overview of my position - I will use hard data more extensively in later rounds, after I see what my parts of my argument my opponent chooses to combat. First, the so-called ""War on Drugs"" has been proven to be completely ineffective by both marijuana advocacy groups and neutral government research. Those who still agree with our current policies, which incarcerate thousands of people each year on non-violent offenses and cost the tax-payer absurd sums of money, are very few and far between. Instead, fines and other violation level punishments should be enacted to control and discourage the recreational use of marijuana. Why should marijuana not be fully legalized? There are several reasons. 1. The fact of the matter is, while THC itself is not a harmful substance, there are still negative health effects associated with the smoking of marijuana. It is reasonable to assume that if marijuana were legalized, marijuana cigarettes would begin to be sold in stores. As such, people would purchase and smoke these cigarettes. Some studies have found that, while 'joints' do not directly cause lung cancer or emphysema, they do have some negative effects on both the lungs and the brain. 2. Additionally, THC is an intoxicant. Anecdotal arguments are made quite often to suggest that marijuana use does not effect driving ability. However, this is absurd, as marijuana is a psychoactive chemical which has numerous effects on the brain and has drastically different effects which depend entirely on the user. Drunk driving is currently responsible for a great number of car accidents in the United States. While it is a fact that people use marijuana regardless of whether or not it is legal, and drive under the influence, I do not believe that legalizing it would have any positive effect in terms of curbing 'high driving'. Instead, methods for road-testing suspected drivers under the influence of marijuana should be developed, testing technology should be implemented by police departments, and laws should be changed to punish high drivers in the same way that drunk drivers are punished. 3. If legalized, marijuana would being to be mass-produced and large companies would soon dominate the market. Today's massive tobacco companies are very rich, and as such, have powerful lobbyists that make it very difficult to change laws concerning the distribution and marketing of cigarettes. It took years just to legally force tobacco companies to display warnings on their packets, and to change advertising methods to stop targeting children. There is no reason to assume that marijuana companies would enter the market with the public's good intentions at heart. Instead, the same types of money-mongers who capitalize on the public's urge to drink and smoke would presumably take control of the market and gain similar deceitful legal power. There is currently little control over the dangerous pesticides and chemical additives in tobacco cigarettes - again, there is no reason to assume these large marijuana companies would treat their crops and products with a similar disregard for their consumers' safety due to mass-production and distribution. 4. While it is true that marijuana smuggling is responsible for a great number of unnecessary casualties of drug wars in Mexico, marijuana is by no means the only drug these black market cartels are responsible for. While legalizing marijuana would certainly decrease gang activity dealing with that particular drug, it would simply shift their focus to other drugs or illicit activities. It would take full across-the-board legalization of all drugs to effectively end these deadly battles, and that is not the resolution. 5. The culture of intoxicant use in America has a long history, and while views have shifted over the years, there is still a general attitude of reverence towards legal intoxicants, especially alcohol. The simple fact is that legalizing marijuana would cast it in a more favorable light. While alcohol is known to have detrimental effects on the human body, the fact that this is generally recognized does not diminish the drinking culture that is promoted in films and on college campuses nationwide. The fact that alcohol is legal means it is generally permitted, and endorsing yet another intoxicant does not seem productive. 6. Legalizing marijuana would mean that it would be easier to obtain. While those that seek it are able to find it, it is still more difficult and risky than simply walking into a store and purchasing it. This would mean that underage (if, as should be presumed, there was an age law associated with marijuana) people would also be able to obtain it more easily, and marijuana IS proven to have a negative effect on the developing brain. Combining the above reasons, among others, I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use. A pre-negation: the argument that marijuana should be illegal because alcohol is illegal is not valid. If brought, I will explain why. If not contested my opponent excepts the validity of this statement. I look forward to my opponent's argument! I have a feeling we are going to agree on a lot, but there are going to be key differences. Thanks again for allowing me the opportunity to debate this issue, and I look forward to a productive, illuminating debate."	CON	83
S2bdac55a-Abf89c670	Marijuana Legislation should not pass.	When you say me saying marijuana Is a drug is not neccesarily permissible is incorrect. Marijuana is a drug regardless of its effects. Whether it helps or not it is still a drug. It is a schedule one substance that shows its value and where it stands. Some pills used for pain such as Tylenol even though it is not extreme will take away your pain, and not alter your brain. It won't alter your senses or your perception. Marijuana does. The effects are similar not the same, and the effects at completely diffrent. Banning and something being illegal is pretty much the same thing? The argument I made that you spoke on and tried to break down didn't make since. However it is a good thing cocaine is illegal as well as other drugs because it is helping the community and the people whom don't know any better. Sure you can say it's a freedom of choice. If someone didnt know any Better or we young, they would be not prone to try it, and even more at that if it was legalised. Cocaine shouldnt be used, it's not the same as Ritalin or else that would be illegal as well. Cocaine makes you ugly :/. When you say if someone wants to take it for a small reason makes it acceptable, then you are also for recreational use. Because if someone went into a dispensary to get cannabis with a scratch, and got some. That's not medical use. A traditional mindset means that if you are destroying your body to have fun and enjoy at an expense that you are ruining your body is not very smart. Right have fun and get hurt. There are other ways to have fun. But hey their lives and outlooks. I'm sure however grandparents in the older generations were not going out and getting wasted and intoxicated. In the end it is free choice of the states. If people want It that bad, then it will be legalized. The world did people a favor out of education and knowing right from wrong. Just like a mother not giving her obese child a candy bar. free choice right :) However once it becomes legal professionals will regret the decision after seeing the consequences. Maybe the government is doing themsleves a favor to get nor money. Yes it has a big impact on the economy but it is unnecesary. I believe smart people will refrain. Don't indulge in worldly pleasures and you will see the garden -to religious people is this quote. An excessive user does eventually become slow. And this I noticable. Chemical dependency one.

If your concern is regarding the personal preferences I set forth in my own hypothetical situation legalizing marijuana, then you are not truly against the legalization of marijuana.

This debate is about the status quo vs. ANY form of legalization, liberalization, or reform of marijuana laws in favor of non-violent users.

S71dd53dc-A6885c44e	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"Con begins by questioning the legitimacy of medical marijuana and how one would go about getting it. Currently, at least 14 states allow for medicinal marijuana; you have to register for a card and then talk to your doctor about a prescription. The information which Con requested can be found here [1]. However, Con is right in stating that it is still illegal at the federal level. While I completely disagree with this legislation, this debate is not about whether or not pot should be legal, or even if it should only be legal for autistic kids. If that were the case, it would have been clarified in R1. However, you'll notice that R1 only talked about the lack of autistic kids in gangs and how/why they should be allowed to cut and sell drugs for profit. So, that is exactly what Con has to defend in this debate. Rebuttal: 1. Con's point makes absolutely no sense. I said, ""For legal purposes, I am in favor of marijuana legalization (buying) for those over the age of 18. Autistic ""children"" do not fit within these parameters."" That argument makes perfect sense -- my personal feelings on legislation do not apply to autistic CHILDREN (the subject of this debate). Con says that this isn't relevant, but clearly it is. 2. Con concedes the first part of the argument, but then claims that he's not telling the children to disobey their parents ~ he thinks they should be allowed to smoke if their parents agree. Well, as I already pointed out (so yes, I did refute it), it would be irresponsible for parents to be encouraging their under-age autistic children to smoke pot. That is a decision for someone of legal age to make. Further, people with autism are considered to be mentally handicapped [2] and in many cases, they're literally retarded [3]. So, given the CHILD'S age (under 18) and the probability that they're not capable of making those kinds of decisions, Con is advocating that a parent use their kids to study something that is not proven to be effective and in fact can severely harm them. This seems like it is violating the child's rights. While pot can be an incredible tool of medicinal value, it can have devastating effects on one's mental health - particularly those who are already susceptible to mental deficiencies. For instance, in addition to weakening the immune system, marijuana has been linked to the acceleration of mental disorders such as paranoia, depression, uncontrollable aggression, bipolar psychosis, schizophrenia, etc. [4]. So, for a child with autism, this can potentially be incredibly dangerous. 3. I pointed out that there were beneficial and less harmful treatments for autism than marijuana. Con countered this by saying (a) I haven't pointed out any, and (b) that I was wrong because there are no known cures. He's right about the second part - there is NO known cure for autism, including marijuana... so this is a moot point. As far as the alternatives, how about: sensory integration therapy, dietary modifications, occupational and physical therapy, play therapy, social stories, picture exchange communication systems, vitamins, etc. [5]. So, now that we've cleared that up, Con's next part of the argument claims that we should allow for this kind of testing specifically to see if/how marijuana can help with autism. A few things - Based on the evidence and knowledge that we DO have, we can infer or at least draw some kind of conclusion about the prospective benefits and whether or not this would be a good endeavor to look into. Also, why does this testing have to be done on CHILDREN specifically? Most importantly, I already detailed how one could go about getting a marijuana registration card, talking to their doctor about medical marijuana, and doing this in a safe and legal way. However, I do think people should consider the risks (especially as it pertains to other mental health disorders and associations regarding pot). 4. Regarding the legality of this issue, it was never clarified in R1 that we were discussing changing the current laws. Moreover, it was not implied or specified in the resolution. So, when I accepted this debate, the only thing up for discussion was the resolution and what Con posted in the first round: ""Since we can't easily force gangs to accept autistic children among their ranks, we need to do the next best thing and provide autistic children with an alternate source of marijuana which they can consume, sell, and cut for profit."" While I think pot should be legal (that's obvious), I don't think it should be legal for children as I have mentioned. Further, if it becomes legal, it should be legal for STUDIES and an advancement of science as my opponent said -- not for autistic people to consume (without knowing the dangers), sell and cut for profit. The basic point, though, is that even if it WERE legal - that doesn't necessarily mean that people *should* smoke pot, let alone people with autism, let alone children with autism. If I can prove -- and I believe I have -- that KIDS with autism probably shouldn't be smoking pot, then I have won this debate. 5. Con concedes that having an autistic gang is unethical and unfeasible. [[ Update ]] So it seems to me the only arguments in question are: 1. If those under 18 should consume pot (Con says yes) 2. If parents should be able to give their under-age and mentally ill children pot (Con says yes) 3. If pot with all of its negative connotations to mental health should be administered to mentally ill children when there are other, healthier alternatives (Con says yes) In the first round, basically Con said that autistic children need a voice (they're not represented in gangs) and should have pot accessible to them. However, as I've pointed out, children should not have this option, and parents should seek healthier alternatives which have proven to be effective. Experimentation is fine, but it should be administered first to adults and those who would probably benefit the most (which science can help us infer). Plus, if this argument applies, then it should apply to ALL people that pot can benefit - which would be most people - not just those with autism. And again, this debate is about autistic children. Even if it were legal for these individuals, their parents should have the first and foremost say about what they ingest for medicinal reasons. Most parents would probably agree that this is a bad idea. [1] http://www.mahalo.com... [2] http://www.autismspot.com... [3] http://www.autism-resources.com... [4] http://cyber.law.harvard.edu...

S349ec7ce-A23ecf05b	the legalization of marijuana	Here's a deconstruction of Pro's final arguments: 1. Law enforcement would still have jobs after decriminalization. Yes, but since a significant potion of law enforcement (including local cops, the Feds and the DEA) goes into policing marijuana, so a lot of people would lose their jobs. Additionally, even if cops existed punish those younger than 18 who were smoking/growing, there are several problems with this. First, minors are punished as minors so this is no real big win for society, and in fact may hinder the personal growth and experience of that minor, not to mention ruin their reputation and credibility. Second, what is the point of the 18+ age limit anyway? It's imposed because we (society) feel that it protects the minor from making a decision we don't feel they have the maturity to make. Well, if pot were legal, it would so drastically increase the chances and likelihood of minors breaking that law that it's almost useless if not detrimental. 2. Parents would be happy to know their kids are happy too puff. This is a statement with no factual basis or evidence to support it. 3. My opponent makes some incomprehensible argument about the government and economics... I've already negated all of the economic arguments in previous rounds, and Pro has offered no new points in this regard. 4. People will learn to repress the effects of marijuana. First of all, even the BIGGEST pot heads still sometimes become lazy, lethargic or apathetic after smoking, regardless of how much or how often they smoke. Believe me - I would know. It happens to the best of us from time to time. Plus, you cannot repress the physical harms of marijuana which I have cited, so Pro fails to provide a substantial argument. 5. My opponent makes some incomprehensible argument about world peace... I've already negated all of the world peace arguments in previous rounds. Plus, what I think he was trying to say was that since there will be new jobs, there will be a stabilized economy and thus achieve world peace...? I know, it's completely non-sensical. But let's dismantle this point anyway. First, I've already said how there wouldn't be this sudden increase in new jobs. Second, nations with stabilized economies can still engage in war. 6. People will buy hemp because it takes time to grow. That doesn't combat the idea that people can buy a plant that's already grown, and then never have to buy additional plants or worry about taking the time to grow them - especially hydroponic ones. 7. Pot is medicinally useful. I never argued that; what I did was combat this point with the harms of marijuana. And, as I said - which Pro did not refute - people who benefit from medical marijuana already do legally, despite the drug being overall criminalized. In conclusion, I am a huge marijuana enthusiast who is most definitely disappointed in the Pro for putting forth such shallow and easily refutable arguments. I have clearly diminished all of my opponent's points, and presented many arguments of my own which my opponent left unreconciled. For that reason, you should clearly be voting for CON despite mine and your own personal opinion on the matter. Debate isn't about what's right or wrong: it's about what you can prove. Pro failed so epically in his attempt to defend the legalization of marijuana that a vote for the affirmative would be a huge disservice and injustice to the field of debate.	CON	87
S59d1f83c-A80162b2d	Marijuana should be legalized	"Thank you for your timely opening round. In this round, I will refute my opponents arguments. Legalization of a substance My opponent states that legalizing something will result in higher usage; we agree on this point. Society will deem it more appropriate to follow the law, as is apparent. However, when Con states that Great Britain had a 15% increase in deaths from all drug once marijuana penalties were downgraded, we must look at the facts. The numbers used in this source are miniscule, nothing that can actually be substantial enough to show a link between marijuana and harder drugs (gateway effect). Deaths from Ecstasy increased from 33 in 2003 and 48 in 2004; cocaine increased from 113 to 147 in this time span; heroin 591 to 744. There are a multitude of variables that most likely change the number of deaths per year from these drugs. Citing the fact that they lessened marijuana penalties as reason why more are dead isn't logical. On top of this, these numbers are far too small to look into. Medicine My opponent states that he can point to another drug that accomplishes the same effects as marijuana with less harm. If we take a look at the statistics, which I will greatly expand on later, marijuana has caused zero deaths [1]. Over-the-counter-medicines and prescription medicines have killed thousands [2]. ""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics, unintentional overdose deaths involving prescription opioids increased 114 percent from 2001 (3,994) to 2005 (8,541), the most recent nationwide data available..."" [2] I would love for my opponent to point to something that can alleviate anxiety, anorexia, pain, vomiting, and many others, while having MINIMUM side effects. I will happily go find statistic on how many have overdosed on that drug, because they most definitely exist. In accordance to my opponent's statement's about carcinogens in marijuana being more abundant then in tobacco, I can agree. Marijuana does indeed contain a high amount of carcinogens. However, marijuana also contains THC, which actually helps deter cancer. ""...marijuana also contains the chemical THC, which [Tashkin] said may kill aging cells and keep them from becoming cancerous."" [3] He states that marijuana contains 20 times the risk of lung cancer, but again, there is not a single case of lung cancer from marijuana alone [1]. On top of this, the study actually doesn't include hard evidence that links marijuana to lung cancer, but has ""hypothetical"" and ""could"" used in it, words that are not definite. The lowering of the immune system is not validly represented by my opponent. According to my opponent's source, marijuana weakens the immune system in those who already have immune system deficiencies, which is solely due to the smoke. ""Smoking marijuana regularly (a joint a day) can damage the cells in the bronchial passages which protect the body against inhaled microorganisms and decrease the ability of the immune cells in the lungs to fight off fungi, bacteria, and tumor cells."" [4] Again, it states this in accordance to those with immune deficiencies. To administer this medicine to these patients with deficiencies in their immune systems, marijuana should be ingested. This eliminates the smoke factor and eliminates all chance of infection in these people, while leaving the medicinal calming effect. What my opponent advocates is more pills and more artificial drugs, which end up killing a fair amount of people yearly. For example, take Vioxx. It was created to alleviate pain for arthritis, yet also created more than double the chance of heart attacks and strokes in users [5]. Marijuana, however, would not increase either of these risks, yet will alleviate that pain. Individual harms It must be made clear that 30,000 people do not die every year in Britain smoking cannabis. This is a misrepresentation of evidence by my opponent. Every reader here can look over the source. It does not state that 30K a year die, but that 30K a year could die. Here is the exact quote: ""Cannabis may be responsible for the deaths of 30,000 people a year if the ill-effects of smoking the drug are comparable to those of smoking tobacco, researchers say."" This is not the same as my opponent's statement. The article goes on to make hypothetical comparisons, all of which are unsubstantiated. Con's 64,000 deaths stat was not found on the link he provided, nor could I find it on some other anti-cannabis sites. Con then states that you can become mentally retarded by smoking weed and says your lungs will be annihilated. While the latter of these two has already been refuted (no lung cancer, no deaths, and actual prevention of cancer in the lungs), the former has not. Again, however, the evidence was construed from the original source. The source actually targets those under the age of 15 who have smoke cannabis. 10% of them developed schizophrenia by age 26. Obviously, just as with tobacco and alcohol, there would be age limits along with legalization. Nowhere did I advocate for no age limits. 15 is a young age where the brain is still developing. Still, the number is again a very small one (1 out of 10). Addictive- My opponent's source for this dates back to 1984, something I would consider a little too old to be using in a debate on current data and trends. Also, my sources point to the other direction. A chart was put together, comprised of a variety of drugs, in an attempt to rate them addiction wise, 1-6, 6 being highest/ very dependent. Categories were established to evaluate all facets of the drug. In dependence, marijuana got a 1, lower than coffee. It also got a one in withdrawal and tolerance [6]. This shows marijuana not to be addictive. Even if marijuana was addictive, it's irrelevant, for a user has the right to get addicted if they so wish. Why is tobacco legal? Nicotine achieved a 6 on the chart, yet it's sold in every gas station in America. ""Fail at education"" Again, marijuana won't be administered to kids, though the source yet again is taken out of context. 15% of car accidents in teens involve marijuana- ""...often in combination with alcohol or other drugs."" [7] is the other part of that article. Even so, studies suggest that those who drive after smoking are capable [1]. Family Con states marijuana users are sick more often than not. His source doesn't state this. Marijuana users don't steal money. Property damage wasn't linked in the source, which was from 1999. For characters sake, I must not elaborate too much on the remainder of the points. I will state that if marijuana were to be legalized, legitimate traders would benefit more then illegitimate. Growing on your own would obviously be prohibited, and the quality of the marijuana shops would be supreme to the shady drug dealer who lives in the dark alley who has brick weed and coke he likes to mix in....Come on, which would you pick? Political lobbying and lawsuits comes with every company. That's not sufficient reason to not legalize something. |Conclusion| I've refuted Con's points. We can all see marijuana to be harmless, beneficial to the economy, and beneficial to the patient. Thank You.

Sd9e09240-Adb973a56	Marijuana Legalization	"Observers, I apologize for the lack of a lively debate. It takes two to tango, and my date seems to have stood me up at prom. Unfortunately I left the options for an opponent wide open, and a member who joined six months ago and has not had one debate (ie. a duplicate account, vote bomber, or troll) accepted the debate, but basically forfeited every round by not presenting an argument. He has done nothing but offend the intelligence of his opponent, and the observers, and use ad-hominem attacks that bear very little logic or reason. ""1. I ask people to answer this question in the comments section: Is my opponent high while he writes his argument?"" -If I am high, then that would bolster my argument. It would prove that someone under the influence of marijuana can be more logical, reasonable, articulate, and respectful than someone who opposes legalization of marijuana for no rational reason. ""If your life sucks so bad that you need pot, go right ahead and smoke it."" -No one ""needs"" pot. But life does suck. People get sick. People get depressed. People want to distract themselves, and have a little recreation. Be it drinking, smoking marijuana, playing video games, or watching TV there is very little harm to society as a whole, and there is no rational reason to oppose legalization of marijuana for personal use. ""My opponent has provided reasons we should tolerate pot heads"" -My opponent is arguing the strawman. I have not defended potheads at all. What I have defended is the position that marijuana should be legalized for personal use by responsible adults. A responsible adult can be defined by law, as with alcohol, and the sale, possession, and use can be regulated with much greater ease than the status quo. ""I'm ready for the next one to try and break in my house."" -Has a person exclusively high on marijuana ever broken into your house? Do you have proof that this is a trend amongst responsible marijuana users? Note the references I provided- over 400,000 people arrested each year for simple possession. Simple possession means there was no other crime attached, including breaking and entering. ""he's right, we should all save our money and let the people who want to smoke pot do it"" -My opponent concedes the debate. People, trust your own intelligence, and vote accordingly. Thank you."

S2a5141f4-A7bf5211a	Recreational Marijuana Should Be Legal	I do not think recreational marijuana should be made legal, this is because of a multitude of reasons for which I believe the cons outweigh the pros. I look forward to this debate.	CON	91
S59d1f83c-A48f8338	Marijuana should be legalized	"I thank my opponent for writing up his case. As requested, I will abstain from offering rebuttals until next round. What does legalisation of a substance do? In schools, we teach children to stay away from cannabis. In addition, we teach children to stay away from tobacco. Yet around the world, smoking rates are consistently higher for tobacco over cannabis. Why? Because after kids are told ""don't do cannabis"" we say ""if you do cannabis, you could be arrested,"" while after being told ""don't smoke tobacco"" we say ""but you are free to do so."" It's not just in our education system either. Adults who go to the store (which is pretty much all adults) are exposed to the opportunity to purchase cigarettes, but not cannabis. Indeed, if they want to buy cannabis, they need to go out of their way to find and deal with a good cannabis dealer. If we can buy cigarettes with our groceries, cigarettes become normalised. Exactly the same parallels can be drawn between cannabis and alcohol. That explains why the act of making a substance legal increases usage rates. For example, in Alaska, cannabis decriminalisation led to a rate of use among teens twice that of the US national average [1]. In Australia, a survey of young non-drug users found 29% didn't use cannabis because it was illegal. The same survey found 19% of ex-cannabis users quit because it was illegal [2]. Scarily, in Great Britain, the downgrading of the penalties for cannabis directly caused an increase in deaths from harder drugs (proving the so-called ""gateway drug"" effect) by a massive 15% [3]. I want to make this very clear - if cannabis was legal, more people would use it. Isn't cannabis a medicine? Recently there has been some evidence that cannabis might have some medicinal benefit, although there is no research that it actually cures anything. For each of the medicinal benefits of cannabis, however, I can point to another drug or therapy that achieves exactly the same, if not a superior, effect. In medicine, however, there is also an old principle, going back to the days of Hippocrates, called ""do no harm."" That principle is not only good ethically, but part of the Hippocratic Oath that doctors take upon graduation from medical school. The practical effect is that when two remedies are available, but one has fewer side effects than the other, doctors should prescribe the one with the least side effects. I'll go into detail about the alternatives to cannabis next round, but you can see the side effects by reading about the harms to users below. A flow-on harm is that people start to self-medicate more if cannabis is seen as a legitimate alternative. For instance, marijuana is already used by many cancer patients. Not only is cannabis utterly useless compared to other drugs, but cannabis actually contains a truckload of carcinogens making the cancer worse[4] - indeed, cannabis carries 20 times the risk of lung cancer as cigarettes [5]. At one time, cannabis was also self-medicated by AIDS sufferers to ease their pain. Doctors have always known, however, that cannabis actually weakens the immune system[6]. Basically, my contention is this: cannabis is an un-necessary and ineffective medicine that comes bundled with dangerous side-effects. Besides that, increased self-medication is a very real harm for dual recreational and medical drugs. Individual harms In the United Kingdom alone, 30,000 people die every year of smoking cannabis [7]. In the United States there are no similar statistics, but it is a factor in at least 64,000 deaths annually [8]. If you're one of the lucky few who doesn't die, you are likely to suffer from mental illness and watch your lungs get annihilated [9], before feeling the effects of a string of cardiovascular issues [10]. The worst part - it's addictive, making it harder to change your mind [11]. In return for these long-term effects (not to mention short-term problems such as memory loss, which particularly causes young people to fail at education[12]), you temporarily lose your sense of reality somewhat. That's why 15% of teen car deaths involve marijuana [13]. After that ""high"" you get a ""low,"" where you feel really bad (as if crashing your car isn't bad enough). The next time you do cannabis, your high will diminish. That leads the smoker to seek stronger drugs to regain the sense of euphoria from losing sense their of reality, multiplying the harm, and causing (in part) the gateway drug effect. That's just the start (and I may offer more next round), but to be fair to my opponent I think these 10 harms (including those cited under self medication) are enough for now. Family/Friends Cannabis smokers are sick much more often than usual [14]. As well as the harm to the economy, somebody needs to look after them. The problem is that this very same somebody will frequently have had all their hard-earned money stolen to fuel a cannabis addiction. Many communities also consider cannabis use morally reprehensible, leading to lying, deceit, families being torn apart and communities shattered. All these harms would accrue even if there was no criminal element to marijuana supply, which I deal with below. In addition, cannabis can cause users to commit crime, particularly property damage [15]. And you know how tobacco has a problem with second-hand smoke? Yeah, that happens with marijuana too. Not to mention the fact that they're going to face higher insurance charges and taxes to compensate for the greater number of cannabis users/abusers. Society Amsterdam is a beautiful city, home to about 7000 marijuana addicts. The law enforcement costs are causing the Dutch a deficit far above the taxes from marijuana. Over the same period that drug use worldwide fell (a 75% decrease in reported cannabis use in the USA) drug use in the Netherlands increased widely (from 30 to 300 ""cannabis coffee shops"")[16]. Among young people, consumption tripled [17]. Aside from the financial problem, there is also a criminal problem. As David Raynes puts it: ""There is the big lie that legalising drugs will take the criminality out of supply. What nonsense. Illegal traders who pay no taxes of any sort can always undercut legitimate traders"" [18]. All that was effected to stop marijuana being a gateway drug. However, Amsterdam still has more drug trafficking issues than anywhere else in Europe. For a small country, that's an appalling record. Now imagine applying all of these societal harms to a big country - like the United States - and you get the picture. Besides all that, look at all the political lawsuits, political lobbying and deep-seated corruption that exists within the cigarette industry. Do you really want a second drug industry doing that?

S59d1f83c-A6f142cd2	Marijuana should be legalized	"I'd like to thank my opponent for closing his case. In this round I will conclude and explain why all of my opponent's rebuttals have entirely failed. I'm not going to tell you how to vote on anything, but I will say that I did not intentionally misrepresent any of my sources - indeed, I didn't even unintentionally misrepresent them. Rather than give in to pro's rant, readers should check sources for themselves. I did make one honest error in round one but that was cleared up in the comments. Additionally, aside from sources, the second way to back statements up is logic. I've been using plenty of logic to substantiate my case. Many of my opponent's statements, however, has neither logic nor sources. I'll be counting all the unsubstantiated assertions my opponent made last round. Additionally, many of my opponent's sources were from lobby groups (ie drugwarfacts) and are thus unreliable and should be ignored (although I'll refute their wild claims anyway). I would like voters to take note, however, that while I addressed every one of my opponent's points in this debate, my opponent refuses to address many of mine. For instance, he ignored second-hand smoke, increasing insurance charges, higher taxes for non-users, and the moral reprehensibility of cannabis in many communities, among many others. That's not fair to me. That shows he fears confronting the issues. I specifically asked him to use the last round to rebut the remainder of my points, and despite the opportunity, introduced no new arguments as a gesture to help him. All this my opponent ignored. I can't debate if my opponent won't respond to what I say. Economic Benefit I've given half a paragraph of logic, and multiple sources, stating why marijuana has never raised tax revenue. I even quoted one of these sources in round two. My opponent, on the basis of a single source with estimates and some maths even he admits is probably shaky, has determined marijuana will raise millions. However, estimates can be wrong. My sources both explain why the estimate is wrong and give evidence for it, such as the experience of Amsterdam. Oh, wait, Amsterdam is a different country, so they'll be different, right? UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. Not only that, but I provided 3 examples from very different economies, one of which was Alaska. My sources had even more examples I could have used. The result has always been the same everywhere. Finally, yes, law enforcement costs are a cost of marijuana. On to employment. The reason why the number of marijuana dealers and growers isn't reported is because the government doesn't know how many people are doing crime. My opponent tries to counter that by saying the only marijuana growers today are medicinal. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. Plus I told you job gains in one sector will be met by losses in another. Then he states there is no correlation between marijuana use and a long list of stuff, such as sick days. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. Plus I gave you sources to the contrary. Note I didn't state marijuana users eat less, I said they will be able to spend less if they give up some of their income on marijuana. Maybe they'll go to McDonald's instead of buying from the local organics shop. That has health harms too, but it mainly hurts certain sectors of the economy. To refute that logic, my opponent states businesses won't suffer. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION, refuted by my logic. Personal Autonomy This last round my opponent argues the US constitution gives everyone absolute personal liberty, with no restrictions on what I can do with body. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. I'm not American, but I'm pretty sure the constitution does NOT say people have absolute personal liberty. Indeed, if I remember correctly, the articles of the constitution do not mention ""liberty"" at all. That's the declaration of independence. I invite readers to check the constitution for themselves, I might be wrong. My opponent talks at length about the need to be consistent with legislation, and how the government can't pick and choose. I've already told you I agree, and that we should ban all industries that cause excessive harm, rather than legalise them all. That's yet another point pro ignored. Health Benefits My opponent states you need all of marijuana to fight cancer. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. I also cited 3 scientific studies proving THC can do it on its own. My opponent also states marijuana cannot be abused. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. My opponent keeps ignoring the side effects and talking of zero deaths, a figure taken from a source that was itself making an unsubstantiated assertion. I'll bet the figure for road deaths caused by Benedril is much lower than for cannabis. Note my opponent has dropped cancer self-medication. On AIDS self-medication, that's my point exactly, when people SELF medicate they often don't know the smoke is harmful so they smoke it. Not to mention that getting cancer is a life sentence if you have AIDS. Individual harms I've already proven why an age limit won't be effective. My opponent has continuously asserted it will work, ignoring all my sources, evidence, and logic. Looks like I've found another UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. My opponent states anything can be mentally addictive. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. My source makes it clear marijuana is much more mentally addictive than most other drugs. My opponent notes his source states people don't lose concentration so don't suffer in education. My source contradicts that. Think about it logically: if you have less time to study because you can't really study when you're high, will your grades go up or down? He then states the gateway effect is nonsense because creepy drug dealers go away. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. What incentive does the creepy drug dealer have to go away? I've provided several examples refuting my opponent's claim, several sources refuting his claim, and explained all this several times. Also, I've already explained the numbers were not too small to be statistically significant. Family/Friends Apparently there is no link between stealing and marijuana. UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. If anyone should know if there's a link, it would be the police. Take a look at what police say in my source. Also, my family and friends point was much bigger than that, but my opponent doesn't seem to see the need to refute the rest of my points. Indeed both this point and the next are only briefly thrown in to the conclusion. Society Lobbying and corruption in every industry? UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTION. The fishing industry has been around for much longer than the tobacco industry, but one is much more corrupt than the other. Conclusion My opponent has not only completely ignored my points, but even dropped several of his own. When he did refute my points, this was inevitably with a series of premises that I had often already refuted. I have not dropped a single point in this debate. I have used a combination of clear sources, multiple real-life case studies and unrefuted logic to rebut my opponent's arguments. Just look at how many unsubstantiated assertions my opponent made last round. When it comes to voting for sources, arguments or conduct, take none of the lies my opponent said about me or my links for granted. This is an important debate. Most of my opponent's arguments - personal autonomy, economic benefit etc - could be used to legalise heroin or methamphetamine. My opponent constantly reiterates the need to be consistent, so let's make a choice. Do we want to live in a society with drugs completely legalised? A world run by the mafia? A world of disease and poverty, where (in defence of ""liberty"") millions are made mind slaves to invasive, dangerous plants and synthetic drugs? Or do we want to learn from our mistakes of the past? Do we want to learn that marijuana is neither necessary nor desirable, for it taxes the people and the government alike? I know which option I would prefer. The choice is yours."	CON	94
S59d1fcd6-A326061c2	Marijuana should be legalized	"Marijuana is a gateway Perhaps I didn't explain my statement thoroughly enough. Marijuana is no longer the first pick among young teens, they are being fed prescription drugs. Dealers no longer make a decent profit off of marijuana since pills can yield up to $40 a pop. The vast majority of dealers will always follow the profit. 2. Marijuana has bad health effects Obviously if someone were to smoke marijuana and then drive they are putting themselves and others at risk because it is a substance that can alter your mental state and impair motor skills though no where near the extent that alcohol does. No one is suggesting that you should be able to drive a car while under the influence of any substance that impairs your abilities. Studies have shown that the most common danger a driver is guilty of is texting and driving which is responsible for 23% of all auto accidents. Now that is a much higher percentage. It is the number one cause of teen deaths that occur while driving. Not only has there been a critical lack of information to show any harmful effects on a persons health but in fact just the opposite. Fast food is proven to be one of the most unhealthy things a person can put into their body and it causes problems like heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. All this in turn causes more health problems which in turn result in a flood of health care bills as well as more prescriptions being handed out and as I outlined the risk of prescribed drugs im sure you can see how this is highly problematic both to a persons health and the economy. But the fact remains that it is up to the individual what they put in their body regardless of the health impacts. It is our freedom to choose for ourselves. Might I add that marijuana does not cause any of the symptoms fast food does. http://www.textinganddrivingsafety.com... http://www.phonearena.com... 3. Use of Marijuana is Immoral That was extremism at its prime. Drugs and alcohol-Prohibition has never worked and cost America only billions of dollars trying to enforce and the lives of law enforcement fighting an unwinnable war. Euthanasia - Another topic all together but it should be legal for those that meet very specific criteria (let me know if you would like to debate this topic) Prostitution - Already legal and millions of people take part its called porn. They are paid to have sex made legal because its caught on camera and called a ""movie"" Polygamy - There is no detrimental impact on society from someone choosing to live like this and their are religions that consent to this. To infringe on this could be violate someones religion such as the Mormons. Gay marriage - Man has been discriminating each other since history began such as women, Indians, blacks, and now gays. Eventually they all get equal rights. Cannibalism - Some of that extremism I referred to. People are killed and eaten in this situation, people on marijuana just eat chips or cookies. Bestiality - Ok this one threw me off...don't know what to say Incest - This is proven to have harmful side effects on offspring from to related family members. Public nudity - This is legal in established nude colonies. Hence they are allowed to but in a designated area. Alcohol has designated areas as well, cant just walk down the street with a bottle. Abortion - Unlike marijuana this involves the life of another. Dueling fights to the death - More extremism, people die in this situation. You have failed to prove consequences to health to oneself or others and used extremism as an attempt at showing similarities. If you believe these things to be relevant that is your opinion and you are entitled to it but that doesn't mean everyone believes the same things. Because people have such drastically different views on what is wrong and right it should be left up to the individual. The butterfly effects is only a theory that is not widely accepted and if one were to use this theory it could be said that religion has led the world to its current state. There is no way to disprove or prove the statement but it fits into the parameters of the butterfly effect. 4. Legalization would increase the number of children having access to it The prohibition of alcohol gave rise to men like Al Capone and only pushed the substance underground. Theres a reason they thought better of it and lifted the prohibition. Crime rates rose as did the number of murders due to the illegality of the substance. [6] increased savings? Marijuana is the cheapest illegal substance there is and it is very easy to grow it in ones own backyard. Marijuana is proven to help relieve stress and relieving stress tends to make people happier. Portugal legalized drugs and they saw a substantial drop in all crimes, overdoses and their economy began to improve from the money that would have been spent prosecuting and jailing people. I did provide videos of law enforcement and politics stating that prohibition does not work but ill provide some more all the same. Let me know if you would like to see more evidence or statistics. I have much more to show http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.countthecosts.org... 5. Drug related arrest benefit society If they are in jail the taxpayers are forced to support them, Florida for example spends over 1 billion a year prosecuting marijuana users. Imagine that billion being thrown into the already underfunded education system and on top of that the profits that would come from taxes put on marijuana. [10] Unable to find the source you found this in [12] As stated before incarceration costs American taxpayers billions ad often times a user can have the drugs smuggled into prison. The longer a person is incarcerated the more likely they are to become institutionalized. They often come out more aggressive and become repeat offenders. Rehabilitation would be a more efficient method but a casual drug user that pays their bills and taxes and who keeps a happy home does not qualify as someone with a problem. http://247wallst.com...

There is a lot of evidence that some of the compounds in the cannabis plant, which is where marijuana comes from, can help people with certain illnesses. But for healthy people, using marijuana causes a number of bad side effects and negative health consequences. Short term marijuana effects include: Sleepiness and depression, an increased heart rate (which can cause a heart attack, anxiety and panic), and delayed reaction times. Long term marijuana effects include: Over the long-term the drug suppresses the immune system, causes growth disorders, lack of motivation and lung damage, changes mood and personality and lowers libido.

S2bdac55a-A5659931a	Marijuana Legislation should not pass.	"Salutations! I would first like to talk about the line ""X is a drug"" this line is non-productive, it plays off peoples currently held beliefs on drugs. For many the word have negative conitations, but drugs can have positive or negative effects, and save many lives. Most medicine people take is a form of this drug or that drug. So yes Marijuana is a drug but that does not have any effect on its value to the U.S. of A. You admit that marijuana has certain benefits but say it is not as good as other medications, if it can do the same job as a prescription pain killer with the same effect why should we only use the pain killer. Many people would rather eat a brownie than pop a pill, so the effects being the same why take away that option. You personally do not think that cocaine should legal, that how ever is not a great argument for banning something. Ritalin, is a common drug, it is legal, and it is incredibly similar to cocaine in structure and function. So if Ritalin is fine to give to kids with ADHD I see no reason for cocaine to be off limits in all cases. If people are being helped by the weed why stop them. Even if the reason why someone wants to take it is small, it can still be a valid reason. You said this in your argument ""To even have fun and enjoy. That's a little strange if you have a traditional mindset."" I fail to see why people wanting to have fun is strange to a ""traditional mindset"". People drink to have fun, yet doing weed for fun is strange. Also what is ""traditional mindset""? People have been taking drugs for a long time to be happier, so wouldn't that be more the traditional mindset. Something' s strangeness also is no reason to ban it. The drug makes people happy, how is that a bad thing? There are plenty of people that take anti-depressants to make them self's happier today. A hedonist (dictonary.com defines as ""one who believes the pursuit of pleasure is the most important thing in life"") would be all for weed being legal, it can bring them great joy but you would force upon them a less enjoyable life. Where does that right come from? that view on life has no more or less weight than anyone's different view. People should be allowed to make there own choices about what they do to, and with there body. Recreational use does not have to be a ""big no no"". The reason you give for it being a no no is that it would make it look acceptable to kids, adults can legally drink and have sex, but kids are not told those are not actions they should be doing before they are adults. Once they are adults it is acceptable. What is wrong or right is subjective, and the U.S. is not the world, so the world will not be going down the wrong path if weed is legalised in the states. You go on to say ""Marijuana will usually make a user eventually lazy, paranoid, and slow."" those effects often are things that make it into stonier movies, but are not actually noticeable symptoms of the drug for a lot of users. You also gave no reason to believe that those are common side effects. One of those symptoms, the paranoia, many people have said is not the effect of the drug but of the fact it is illegal. The paranoia is associated with the drug may very well disappear when the drug is legalised. Weed is already recreationally legal in Colorado, and those effects have not caused the state much trouble so far. People still get there work done and they did not all become slow. You can walk around Denver and not every thing smells like pot. Just as there are different types of drunks there are different types of highs I would not mind eating in a restaurant with a high couple, it is quite possible that I would not even now they are high. I will also call to mind that coming to work high is like coming to work drunk. Being high in many places is grounds for termination, legalization will not change that. The drug is beneficial in some cases, so why not teach kids about its pros and cons its better than them trying it with a friend. I also would like to talk about the idea it is a gateway drug, here is a quote from national institute of drug abuse ""people who are more vulnerable to drug-taking are simply more likely to start with readily available substances like marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol, and their subsequent social interactions with other substance users increases their chances of trying other drugs."" so this idea is not really weeds fault. There are different choices for pain relief but there are reasons why weed might be the best choice for some people, why limit people's options. I will also like to talk quickly about money, the money made in weed sales is good for the states, the tax revenue is very large. Weed does not need to be illigal."	PRO	100
Sc0722593-Ad262f446	Marijuana should be legalized for both Medicinal and Recreational use	The information you present on the effects of marijuana is definitely interesting, but I have to ask, would legalizing marijuana for recreational use have any impact on lowering the instances of driving while high? 2.Pro has very good points here. However, I believe that legalizing marijuana and allowing companies in the US to mass-produce it for recreational use would have a negative effect on the safety of the product. Pro makes a good point saying that marijuana is a clean plant, but so are oranges, apples, and grapes. You can eat these right off the plant. Now that food is mass-grown, however, each individual plant gets less important. Harmful pesticides are blanketed over the crops by plane. Additives are used to preserve plants and enhance flavor. Seeds are genetically modified to produce the types of fruits we EXPECT when we go to the supermarket – we want big juicy oranges and crunchy apples, and we want them to be the same every time we buy them. They should look perfect, taste perfect, be perfect. We want this enough that we are willing to allow these big companies to use potentially hazardous chemicals to meet our standards. We have a couple of options, of course, to avoid these potentially hazardous chemicals. We can buy local (or sometimes organic) foods that are guaranteed to be free of the chemicals, or we can grow our own crops. However, these options come at a premium. They are more expensive. People without the resources or time to eat healthy are forced into purchasing the cheap, often less healthy alternative. The same standard applies to the inebriants on the market today. More expensive cigarettes, like American Spirits, are additive free. Cheaper cigarettes are not. More expensive liquors are purer. With marijuana legalized, there is no question that the corporate mass-producers of marijuana would seek the cheapest way to produce and distribute their crop. If that means making it less healthy by using pesticides, preservatives, and additives, so be it. Now, you might argue that legalizing marijuana would mean local growers and home-growers could grow without risk, dropping prices and making the safe product more available. However, using the previous example, it is legal to grow fruit, and yet local products are still more expensive. This is because the mass-producers are extremely good at making their product as cheap and available as possible. There is no reason to assume that the mass-produced marijuana would not also be less expensive, forcing consumers without a lot of resources into purchasing that cheaper, less healthy alternative. Also, keeping marijuana illegal maintains that element of risk on the parts of both mass-producers and local growers. This means less concern is placed on making the product cheap than on finding viable ways to distribute the product. Therefore, illegal growers have less incentive to use harmful chemicals to cheapen the product. People are willing to pay a lot of money (and currently do pay a lot of money) in order to obtain marijuana, and prices are high mostly because of the risk involved. In my experience (and if Pro has counter examples, please bring them) I have never heard a dealer describe one product as being ‘safer' due to less chemical use than another. This is because, due to its illegality, dealers don't fly planes over their crops dumping pesticides. Keeping it hidden is the whole point. Legalizing it would open the plant up to a world of additives and pesticides that are currently of no interest to growers and distributers, as their focus is on keeping it out of view, not making it cheaper. Additionally, large companies invariably release different varieties of their product. This means using the cheapest chemical flavorings available. Marijuana is currently available in many varieties, but none that I know of are chemically flavored. If mass-producers were to flavor their products, which is an inevitable eventuality, they would seek to use the cheapest method available, which is chemicals, regardless of their health effects. 3.I agree that marijuana is a great source of income for these cartels. I am still not convinced, though, that legalizing marijuana would be the best way to stop the violence between these cartels. Black markets find a way to sustain themselves. Instead of putting a dent in these cartels' business by removing one of their sources of income, we should be more active in our assistance to Mexico in battling these cartels. This sounds hypocritical – after all, I have already conceded that the War on Drugs has been ineffective – but the difference is that we should be shifting our focus to eliminating the source of these drugs rather than discouraging its use with insane punishments for users. 4.As Pro said we generally agree here. However, the fact of the matter is that alcohol (and marijuana, actually) use is praised in this culture. I agree that the stoned pose an immeasurably lesser threat to society than drunks, but the fact is that legalizing marijuana is a way of endorsing its use. Currently there are countless medications that should by all rights be illegal that are instead prescribed by doctors. Is relying on these medications to solve our sleep issues, our depression, or our stress the best course of action? Absolutely not. Endorsing the use of drugs of any kind is a bad policy, as it gears our cultural attitude towards seeking release in the form of substances rather than the many beneficial alternatives to substance use. Why get an endorphin release from exercise when you can smoke a joint and feel twice as good? In that same mindset, why seek healthy ways to relieve stress and depression when you can pop a pill? In short, endorsing the use of drugs is bad for our cultural mindset. Thanks, and I look forward to your reply!	CON	101

S86fcaef8-A2bbb42d6	Legalization of Marijuana	"I do see where you are coming from. However, you have to realize that marijuana actually is bad for your body. According to Healthline's article ""The Effects of Marijuana on the Body"", marijuana is very similar to tobacco, in that it ""is made up of a variety of toxic chemicals that can irritate your bronchial passages and lungs."" Also, when it comes to younger people whose brains are not fully developed, ""marijuana can have a lasting impact on thinking and memory skills."" Teens, for example, are still in some of the heaviest stages of brain development. Those who smoke marijuana have impaired brain development. So when you say that doctors wouldn't be prescribing it if it was bad, you really have to look deeper into the issue. There are also many doctors out there who do not know what they're doing. While marijuana may have clear medicinal uses, that doesn't take away the fact that it still damages the body in other ways, as science has proven time and time again. I'm glad that you are also providing evidence to support your claim. However, the evidence you have provided classifies as a logical fallacy, or faulty thinking. The case which you have presented may in fact be true for you and your mom, but this one example is not near enough information to go against the countless scientific studies of marijuana on the body. Because of these dangers that are presented with the use of marijuana, I still firmly believe that it should remain illegal in order to protect our communities."	CON	103
Sf77858a3-A34af3142	Marijuana is safer to consume than both alcohol and tobacco	"Notes Thanks for this debate. Writing this round has been fun and I hope the next few are equally so. This debate is unavoidably going to be about sources; the method of determining safety of a substance is through research. I will refer to Pro's sources as numbers, by the order they were presented in. Definitions Marijuana ""1: hemp 1a, c""[1] Alcohol ""1b: drink (as whiskey or beer) containing ethanol""[2] Tobacco ""1: any of a genus (Nicotiana) of chiefly American plants of the nightshade family with viscid foliage and tubular flowers; especially: a tall erect annual tropical American herb (North tabacum) cultivated for its leaves""[3] Carcinogen ""a substance or agent causing cancer""[4] Refutation Paragraph One (Intro) Just the actual level of danger matters here. Paragraph Two (Benefits) Excerpt from his source 1: “We know that there are as many or more carcinogens and co-carcinogens in marijuana smoke as in cigarettes,” researcher Donald Tashkin, MD, of UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine tells WebMD. His own source states that marijuana has just as many or more agents known to cause cancer as cigarettes (not pure tobacco). His source also claims that it is not clear why they achieved these results. Unfortunately, his source 2 provides very little information about the actual study conducted. Regardless, Cancer.org states that ""[e]ven though placebos do not act on the disease, they seem to have an effect in about 1 out of 3 patients.""[5] So I propose that it is likely his study showed less effectiveness than a placebo. Marijuana reduces ability of bronchial cells to fight tumors, too.[7] Paragraph Three (Other Forms) Pro claims that safety of marijuana smoke says nothing of the safety of its other forms, but fails to show reason as to why vaporized marijuana or marijuana edibles are healthier. Also, this debate is about marijuana, not THC. Pro states that just the THC is extracted to make these other forms. No argument there, but THC is not marijuana. It is one ingredient. Pro is only conditionally supporting the resolution. The marijuana evaluated here should be that smoked from a pipe; it contains all the ingredients of marijuana without extra from a marijuana cigarette or other form of delivery. Paragraph Four (The Dangers of Marijuana) We have to worry about marijuana when smoked. Pro admitted himself that the vapors and edibles are just THC, not marijuana. Many, many more things can be said about the dangers of marijuana use than increased heart rate and cognitive and physical impairment. We have to worry about lung cancer, as marijuana is 20x more likely to cause lung cancer than cigarettes.[6] It also has twice as many carcinogens as cigarettes.[6] So cancer in general is a danger. Marijuana reduces ability of bronchial cells to fight tumors and other possible issues, suppresses the rest of the immune system in general, and speeds up the progression of HIV to AIDS.[7] The article goes on to state that ""[i]t has been suggested that marijuana is at the root of many mental disorders, including acute toxic psychosis, panic attacks (one of the very conditions it is being used experimentally to treat), flashbacks, delusions, depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, and uncontrollable aggressiveness. Marijuana has long been known to trigger attacks of mental illness, such as bipolar (manic-depressive) psychosis and schizophrenia."" Wow, seems quite a bit worse than just stating, without any sources, that the only issues are ""increase[d] heart rate"" and ""cognitive and physical impairment"". Paragraph Five (Heart Rate Increase) He states that all three substances lead to this. No need for argumentation here. Paragraph Six (""Cognitive and Physical Impairment"") Tobacco Pro states that [p]hysical impairments from [marijuana] are... slightly higher compared to tobacco"" with no other comments on tobacco from him here. Alcohol He provides no sources to state any physical impairments of alcohol use. So I will ignore the claim that alcohol impairs people physically, as it is unwarranted. Onto the second issue of driving. His source 5 only finds a correlation between states that have medical marijuana and lower traffic-related deaths. If there's a correlation between a society in which people drink juice and a society in which serial killers are rampant, does drinking juice lead to serial killings? His source 6 states that the study ""did find that drivers were more easily distracted when under the influence."" This is hugely important. Distracted driving accounted for 5,474 deaths and 448,000 injuries in 2009.[8] And the problem is already getting worse without the widespread use of marijuana. There was a 4% increase in the proportion of distracted drivers in fatal crashes from 2005 to 2009.[8] Oh, and also, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that 6.8% of drivers involved in collisions test positive for THC (once again, not synonymous with marijuana, but a major ingredient of it).[13] Paragraph Seven (Addiction) First of all, nicotine is not addictive.[9][10][11] Onto Pro's claims about alcohol. Because he has no sources, it is hard to determine how addictive alcohol is when it ""has been studied to also show physical dependency [sic]."" I assert that it isn't very addictive with alcohol dependence in 5% of the population[12]. This is opposed to marijuana, with 9% of the total number who will use it, 17% (1 in 6) of the teenagers who start in their teenage years, and 25-50% of daily users estimated to develop dependence.[13] Paragraph Eight (Summary) Fatal marijuana overdoses have been reported.[14] All refuted previously. Paragraph Nine (Types of Tobacco) I'm talking about tobacco, not substances containing tobacco. ""Dip"" tobacco Contains nuclear waste, cyanide, more[15] Cigarettes Common knowledge is that they have more than tobacco E-cigarettes Do not contain tobacco[16] My Case Observation This debate is of which is the safest of the three drugs. If the answer is marijuana, Pro wins. If the answer is alcohol or tobacco, Con wins. C1: Gateway Drug I made a table with statistics of [17] http://tinyurl.com... C2: Dangers of Marijuana Subpoint A: Medical · 20x more likely to cause lung cancer than cigarettes, twice as many carcinogens[6] · Reduces ability of bronchial cells to fight tumors and other possible issues[7] · Suppresses the rest of the immune system, too[7] · Speeds up progression of HIV to AIDS.[7] · Causes many mental disorders, such as acute toxic psychosis, delusions, depersonalization, depression, flashbacks, panic attacks, paranoia, uncontrollable aggressiveness[7] Subpoint B: Other Apply all non-medical statistics and arguments about the danger of marijuana used in refutation C3: Alcohol and Tobacco Apply all statistics and arguments about alcohol and tobacco used in refutation C4: Legal This one's simple.

S349ec7ce-Ae5281805	the legalization of marijuana	"Hello fellow debaters. As DDO's most vocal advocate of legalizing marijuana, I decided to challenge my debating skills and argue the opposite in favor of criminalizing one of America's favorite past-times. As the instigator of this debate and the one in affirmation of the resolution, Pro has the burden of proving that the U.S. should legalize marijuana. If I can negate all of his arguments (and I will), then you have no reason to vote Pro. In addition, I'll conclude with some final arguments of my own. Thanks, Pro, for starting the debate and good luck! -- Pro's Contentions -- 1) We could tax marijuana and profit. 2) Legalizing pot would create jobs. 3) A lot of people would leave jail. 4) Pot makes people tranquil; that's how we'll establish peace. 5) Pot would only be for people 18+ 6) Pot has medicinal uses. -- Rebuttal -- In one fell swoop, I can most certainly negate my opponent's first two premises. Pro insists that the government and society would both profit off of legalizing marijuana because we could tax the product and create jobs for the people. Ladies and gentlemen, this is wishful thinking. Consider this: If marijuana plants were legal, would you go to the store to buy it, my friends? No. You would do what Pro suggested in R1 -- grow it in your right own backyard. Or, like most people, in warehouses or little hydroponic containers in your home. This would be faster, cheaper, easier and the overall most convenient and resourceful option on any cost-benefit analysis. Thus legalization would NOT lead to the creation of any new jobs, or bring in any new revenue to the government (who already taxes way too much, in my opinion). This brings me to Pro's next argument. Pro insists that by decriminalizing marijuana, a lot of people would be released from jail. I've got two main arguments here. First, if you criminalize pot, many people will lose their jobs including cops, lawyers, DEA officers, etc. This brings me to my second point. If these people are all out of work, AND a whole bunch of people are released from jail therefore being expected to work, then where do you suggest these people find jobs? Nearly 10% of the population is unemployed at the moment which is one of the biggest detriments to the American economy. I've already proven how legalizing pot won't create jobs, so where do you expect these thousands of misplaced workers to go? The result would be an increase in taxes for the working people, and more people unemployed than ever. This is not only bad to the economy but society as a whole. When people don't have ""real jobs,"" they resort to criminal activity to make money. This would make life unsafer, and for the offenders, their punishments more intense thus leading to their imprisonment and perhaps the ruining of their lives in a more disastrous way. Pro's 4th point is that pot makes people tranquil, and as such it can help us establish world peace. Well, a bunch of Americans already smoke pot, and guess what -- there's not world peace. Again, this is wishful thinking on the part of Pro. We have war and unstable nations/relations in this world for deep reasons - hatred and greed - that even the fattest blunt or greenest bowl could not cure. Additionally, while pot is known to make people feel silly, sleepy and hungry, it's also just as known to make people apathetic, lazy and unproductive. Do we really need an increase of distracted drivers on the road or people being less productive than they already are? Just because people may not get caught or in trouble for their irresponsible behavior while high doesn't mean that the behavior itself wasn't wrong. Next, Pro argues that pot should only be legal for people who are 18 and older. Right... the same way that nobody under 18 smokes cigarettes, and people under 21 don't drink. Ha! Pro and I both know that this law would NOT be enforceable; especially with people being able to grow it in their own home with ease. As such, we can assume that minors will be ingesting THC on a daily basis. Not only is this morally questionable, but it socially irresponsible as hell. We're trusted to encourage healthy habits for our children. And while there ARE medicinal uses for marijuana (I'll address that in a second), there are also known DANGERS of the drug as well. So, on to Pro's final argument: Medicinal marijuana. As I said, though there are known medical uses for marijuana, there are also significant health risks. For instance, smoking pot is known to weaken people's immune system, increase the likelihood of mouth cancer (perhaps other kinds of cancer as well), accelerate some of the diseases it's trying to help, progresses the speed of HIV and AIDS faster, lead to an increase in schizophrenic patients, etc. So, it would seem that the dangers of marijuana cancel out the benefits of marijuana. Plus, let's not ignore the reality that legalizing pot would undoubtedly feed into the obesity problem in the United States (haha pun intended). Not only does pot give you the munchies, but it also encourages the consumption of delicious snacks such as pot brownies or hash cookies. This obesity of course can lead to cardiovascular trouble and diabetes to name a few risks. Finally, pot is illegal and yet marijuana still benefits people in a healthy way. Why? Those individuals have prescriptions. As such, this is a completely moot point on the part of Pro. Illegal pot still benefits those who are deemed to need it by doctors and psychologists. If people would like to self-medicate with pot, they can see a doctor and see if they meet the criteria, and move to a state that allows medicinal marijuana. All of Pro's contentions have been dismantled; Back to my opponent for now :)"	CON	105

If heroine were to become legal tomorrow, I still would not use it. I do not need the government to save me from myself, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself."" The reason that many people do not try it is because they do not have access to it or is too expensive for them to buy it from dealers. If like you said Heroin would become legal tomorrow, not everyone would immediately use it. How ever some people would use it because they now have access to it and may use it simply by urge or even from peer pressure. We dont need the government to take care of either of us because we are very smart people and know the harmful effects of Heroin, but not everyone does, and others do not care about the damage they could do to themselves. ""Marijuana is generally in the top 10, if not the number one cash crop in pretty much every state in the union."" You did not cite the source but it is true. If you investigate further though you will see just exactly who is growing the Marijuana, it is not the states or the government. People grow Marijuana (and lots of it) and the reason why it is considered a cash crop in many states is because of one report. http://www.drugscience.org... One person (who did not work for the government) estimated the value of Marijuana and then multiplied that number by how much is grown to calculate the enormous sum. People have illegally grown Marijuana and because it is an illegal substance it has a high price, but it is grown simply to be sold to others which classifies it as a cash crop. My point is, Marijuana is not being grown on wide open farms like cornfields in Iowa or Orange Groves in Florida and then sold to other countries for a price that is competitive to other nations exporting the same good. It is grown illegally indoors and in secret places like sheds with lights where people then sell it to other Americans for an ungodly high price because it is an illegal substance. http://stopthedrugwar.org... ^ that source may appear biased, but it just provides facts you can see for yourself. If you dont believe my argument consider this. 1 bushel = 30 to 60 lbs Amount of corn grown in the US = 9 to 10 billion bushels Amount of Marijuana grown (illegally) in the US = 1.5 million pounds were confiscated so estimating that only 10-20% of all grown Marijuana is found that would cause production to be between 7.5 to 15 million bushels Bushels of corn = 9 to 10 BILLION Bushels of Marijuana (guess) = 8 to 15 MILLION Price of one bushel of Corn = $2 to $3 Price of one bushel of Marijuana = $70,000!!!!!!!! :O http://www2.econ.iastate.edu... http://www.druglibrary.org... http://www.interstock.ru... http://www.cnbc.com... My point is, its not the states that grow all this weed, its illegal growers. The reason its the number one ""cash crop"" is because 1 bushel of weed is literally about 3000 times more valuable then 1 bushel of corn. Tons of Marijuana is grown and the government is doing a rather crappy job of trying to limit access to it. But since it is illegal the government has been limiting access to it, even if its only 10 to 20% You make an assumption that all teenagers in rehabilitation centers were caught, arrested, and then given an unbalanced choice by a judge to then be forced into rehab. That does happen but when you examine the teenage population (those who often go to rehab more than any other age group) it is often because their families have decided to put them in there and pay for it out of their own pockets. To assume that ALL teens are in rehab because they were ALL caught and were ALL given a choice of either rehab or jail is false.

S86da9e6a-A79289ef8	Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.	"I would like to thank my opponent for this argument, but it isn't as truthful as it may seem... To begin with, I am going to evaluate his sources. My opponent sites sources such as: www.drugabuse.gov www.abovetheinfluence.com www.teengrowth.com sites that OBVIOUSLY have a bias. this debate is about a subject which the government STRONGLY opposes, and so there really isn't a way that we can credibly site the government, and expect them to be completely honest. Yes, I did use government sources, but they just provide solid facts about yearly fatalities from legal substances, not substances that they stand solidly against. If we were debating the intelegence of African Americans when compared to caucasians, for example, we wouldn't trust a white supremacy site, now would we? In the same way, we cannot trust websites like www.abovetheinfluence.com, because that would be TOTALLY ridiculous! In the same sense, you cannot quote an organisation about something that they were designed to take a stance against! Now that that has been said, allow me to take apart this semi-truthful warped view of the so called ""facts"". ""Prohibition of Marijuana does control consumption of it because it severely limits ACCESS to it. People who are addicted to Marijuana will go to extreme costs and pay even more to have access to the drug, but legalizing it would mean everyone would have constant access to it and then millions of more pe0ple would increase the number of those addicted to the drug and the side effects it causes..... "" To begin, I do not see any proof that marijuana is addictive, at all! I have personally, (along with the majority of the people I know) have used marijuana for YEARS, and I have had to quit for a while (either for court, or a job interview, etc.) and have NEVER experienced physical withdrawal that an addict would feel. Yes, if you use marijuana every day like I have before, and then abruptly stopped, then you will see some differences, but that happens with everything, including soda. Does that stand to reason that we can become addicted to soda, and therefore will stop at NOTHING to get it? no, because that is ridiculous. Also, if a substance is that harmful to your body, and it is something that people wouldn't do normally, what makes you think that legalizing that substance would cause more people to do it? If heroine were to become legal tomorrow, I still would not use it. I do not need the government to save me from myself, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. as far as it limiting access, that is a complete lie. Marijuana is generally in the top 10, if not the number one cash crop in pretty much every state in the union. This excerpt was taken from abcnews.com: ""Contrasting government figures for traditional crops -- like corn and wheat -- against the study's projections for marijuana production, the report cites marijuana as the top cash crop in 12 states and among the top three cash crops in 30."" The study estimates that marijuana production, at a value of $35.8 billion, exceeds the combined value of corn ($23.3 billion) and wheat ($7.5 billion). Now, how in any way is that limited? ""1 in 6 teenage marijuana users become addicted"" This is actually based on teenagers who are in rehab for marijuana. Now, the reason those teens are in rehab is because they are given two options by most judges: Do a CRAZY amount of time in jail, where you have no freedoms, or go to rehab, where you can usually still get to live at home, and still have a lot of the freedoms you wouldn't if you were in prison. Now, what would that teen choose? ""Marijuana deteriorates memory, attention, and learning skills"" cite one study that proves this. ""People who have used the drug feel less physically and mentally healthy"" actually, speaking from personal opinion, it actually helps me become more creative, and do things like write stories, ( or debate. :D ) and I have not had any negative effects that I can name. Things like poor diet can also make you feel this way, but we shouldn't go around trying to make Cheetos illegal, now should we? ""As of 2012 guess how many deaths in the US involved Marijuana"" now, if you will, please tell me where you got these statistics for a year that hasn't even happened yet? Until you can, then please do not cite whatever study THAT was. now, I think that I have refuted my opponents arguments adequately. thank you for your time!"	PRO	107
Sdb751e93-A9066db83	Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.	"THANK YOU to my opponent for his/her contentions. I will spend this time refuting them and then highlighting the impacts of the arguments I provided. My opponent starts out by claiming that cannabis is dangerous. Just because a chemical is dangerous does NOT mean that it should be illegal. Legality and morality do not inform one another. One could argue that prostitution, excessive alcohol, and fatty food are all ""dangerous"" in some sense, but no American citizen has ever argued to make all of these activities illegal. Being an American means having the discretion and liberty to take risks and to choose activities that the moral actor is comfortable with and agreeable to. This is going to be an issue with my opponent's case for the rest of this debate. Then, even if the voter still believes that morality (whether it's dangerous/harmful) should dictate legality (whether it becomes legalized), my opponent does not successfully show the dangers of cannabis. There are none. He/she states that cannabis can make you panic or give you anxiety. This is a negative side effect called paranoia, but not all strains (varieties) of marijuana result in this effect. Furthermore, the smoker has to use a large amount of marijuana in order to experience these effects. Much more frequently, people claim using marijuana because it REDUCES their anxiety and provides medical BENEFITS. My opponent says that cannabis can kill you. However, to the contrary, there have been no deaths due to marijuana use. His/her argument is not only speculative but also a slippery-slope, as he/she first needs to prove that marijuana substantially increases the rate of heartbeat and THEN that an increase in the rate of heartbeat leads to death. Neither of these have been proven. Please do not believe this ridiculous statement. My opponent brings up some more speculative arguments about what cannabis COULD do to a moral actor (i.e. someone who chooses to use it), but the problem is again that just because something is harmful does not mean that it should be illegal. He/she keeps using words like ""can"" and ""could"" and then ""can"" again. These arguments are speculative and are not substantiated with the evidence that my opponent tried to provide. Marijuana does not create these harmful consequences, and even if it did, these effects would not develop until decades of heavy marijuana use had occurred. My opponent also attempts to compare marijuana to tobacco and says that marijuana is five times as unhealthy, however this is nonsense. Marijuana does not have the carcinogens and nasty chemicals that comprise a regular cigarette, and while 400,000 people die from tobacco each year, zero die from marijuana use. My opponent continues with speculative arguments that might have been proposed by some biased, anti-drug group, but they are not rooted in true empirical statistics. The only other argument that my opponent tries to form is that marijuana increases crime rates. Evidence to the contrary shows the opposite. In fact, when Washington D.C. legalized cannabis in 2015, the crime rate decreased by 99% (so was just about eliminated). Why? First of all, when marijuana is legalized, police officers spend their time fighting serious crimes like murder and rape, rather than nonviolent crimes like marijuana use. This allows more violent crimes to be deterred, and therefore their rates are reduced. Perhaps a more convincing refutation is that, under my opponent's world, marijuana is ITSELF a crime. So, if marijuana were legalized, then no one who smoked pot ever again wouold be committing a crime. Quite obviously, this would reduce the crime rate, since the action in question is no longer a crime. So, in summary, here is what is wrong with my opponent's contentions: 1. Just because something is harmful does not mean that it should be illegal. 2. Marijuana is not harmful, and consumers use it for medicinal or at least stress-relieving reasons. My opponent's speculative claims should not be considered substantial evidence. 3. Legalizing marijuana reduces or eliminates the crmie rate rather than increases it. The evidence can be substantial but is also simply intuitive: if marijuana is no longer a crime, then the ""crime"" goes down. I will now highlight my arguments and explain how they tie back to the framework of this debate, which is net benefits to society. Recall that the side that better demonstrates whether legalizing/criminalizing marijuana is better to society should win this debate. Contention 1: Economic benefits. Legalizing pot would create money and jobs, because we would be able to collect valuable tax revenue on something that people will use regardless of whether or not the laws allow for it. This revenue is used for health care and education. Furthermore, legalizing pot saves money, because there will be fewer prisoners that drain tax dollars due to long years of imprisonment. Contention 2: Social benefits. Legalizing pot means that police officers channel their time and attention on violent crimes, such as rape and murder, rather than silly nonviolent crimes like smoking weed. This clearly reduces the crime rate and allows for a safer society in which citizens can enjoy freedoms rather than be locked up in jail for much of their lives. Contention 3: Racial benefits. The enforcement of marijuana laws has been extremely racist and discriminatory. Author Michelle Alexander calls it ""a new Jim Crow"", meaning that blacks continue to have it much harder than whites when it comes to the criminal justice system, even though they are no more likely to use pot than their white counterparts. Legalizing pot prevents police officers from being able to continue with and conduct these racist enforcement procedures. Contention 4: Safer marijuana. Kepeing cannabis illegal DOES NOT DETER citizens from using it. This will be the most challenging argument for my opponent to respond to. He/she says that cannabis is harmful; even if it were, keeping it illegal does not stop people from its use. At least, with legalizing pot, we can verify that the cannabis is as safe as possible and that no sketchy drug dealers or cartels are entering the country with weed that could be laced with PCP or some truly dangerous chemical. Contention 5: Freedom of choice. Americans should be able to do whatever they want so long as their actions do not infringe upon the rights of others. This is the nation that the Founding Fathers intended, and to the most extent we let people make their own decisions. Since we let people smoke cigarettes and eat unhealthy food, they should also be able to smoke cannabis. Nothing about cannabis is harmful to the user, let alone to those who do not use it. My opponent will be expected to refute all five of these contentions with substantial evidence and reasons to believe otherwise. It is hard to argue against a legalization procedure that would create money, save money, reduce violent crimes, incerase health and safety, reduce racism, and promote the freedom of choice that responsible Americans deserve. My opponent also needs to return to his/her contentions and show why my refutations of them do not hold. Finally, he/she must tie his/her arugments back to the framework of net benefits to society. Unless my opponent is successfully able to show that the disadvantages to society of legalization overwhelmingly outweigh the advantages, the voter should vote Pro. My opponent has 48 hours to accomplish these tasks.

S59d1fc3b-A4b0be909	Marijuana should be legalized	"So you said ""The United States is not just a place for people to do whatever they feel like. Americans have freedoms but we can't just do whatever we feel like."" First of all The United States is a place for people do whatever they feel like as long as it does not cause any harm to someone else or fatal harm to themselves. As I said before alcohol does more damage then Marijuana. That is legal so why not Marijuana. Now I will begin my second point in this argument. The use and selling of Marijuana will tremendously boost our poor economy. When the pilgrims first got here they had nothing and were dying just like every other civilization tried. Then they planted tobacco. The Europeans loved the pilgrims tobacco. The soil that it grew in made have something new to it. So European countries would buy them instantaneously. They begin to trade and sell trade and sell. Tobacco saved the economy. Was it healthy? Absolutely not. Another case of this is cotton The slave-based TOBACCO ECONOMY that sustained the Chesapeake region was in deep crisis in the late-18th century and some Virginia leaders even talked about ending slavery however Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin a device that separated the seeds from cotton balls. This saved another economy. Marijuana can save our economy it can be that plant.

S71dd53dc-A119bc9c8	Autistic children should not be allowed to smoke marijuana.	"Rest assured, my game face is on. I imagine that I'll need it for this debate. I'd also like to suggest to my opponent that further discourse be laced with reeferences to marijuana. To voters: finding them all will earn you brownie points. Here is a rather elephantine list of slang terms to utilize: http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov... ======= Contention ======= I was zooming through news headlines this morning, and there was a report claiming that marijuana was charged with curing an autistic boy of his chronic symptoms of autism. http://www.kauz.com... (The video in this link will really hit home.) http://www.independent.co.uk... http://rawstory.com... Just Google 'Marijuana Cures Autism' or anything of similar kind, and you'll see pages and pages of these claims. Some are loco, but there are a few that I wouldn't dismiss as light stuff. As of yeh, there has been no reliable scientific study to conclusively confirm or deny these, thus I contend that we ought to legalize marijuana for autistic children so that scientists may get to the root of this claim. As I have debated ""Public health concerns justify compulsory immunization"" atleast 51 times durong the past month, I used the term 'allow' and not 'require' because mandated marijuana is no better than its current ban. Another, better, solution is: all parents willing to allow their autistic children to consume marijuana will be used as part of the study. ======= Reefutation ======= 1. While the arguments are probably stacked in the favor of 18 legalization, if Pro toke this debate to argue that point, she's in the wrong place. 2. I'm not advocating or debating that children should break their parents' rules. Given the probable physical and mental condition of those children eligible for this study, I highly doubt any would be able to lay hands on a stash of pot, let alone hide their habit from their parents. 3. Pro atleast gets up against the stem of my argument here. However, while there are more alternatives than one could shake a stick at, science is still wet behind the ears when it comes to the study of marijuana. We don't need pin point accuracy, but we need to have at least some scientific backing for our claims. I don't advocate this for the proven effX, but in order to prove the effects. 4. Post-fiat, marijuana would be legal for autistic children, so the parents would not be condoning illegal drug use. 5. Despite the incredible logic behind my original argument, I won't be pursuing it further. I realize that there are preeferable alternatives, most notably the formation of an all-autistic gang. Note: I'll give anyone a gold star who finds all 28 hidden reeferences."	CON	112
Sc0722593-A7108e9e8	Marijuana should be legalized for both Medicinal and Recreational use	"Thank you to my opponent who has made a very good argument, with some valid points. I see eye to eye on some of those points but as stated they're some fundamental differences in both of our arguments. 1. This is in relation to your argument in which you state ""laws should be changed to punish high drivers in the same way that drunk drivers are punished."" I disagree heavily with this statement, while I recognize that driving while under the influence of Marijuana poses some danger compared to someone who is sober, comparing the punishment of Driving while high on Marijuana to driving while intoxicated on Alcohol is a lot worse. Numerous studies from different organisation that the effects on driving while intoxicated from Marijuana are relatively benign. A study from researchers based at Hartford Hospital reveals that marijuana has little effect on the group's simulated driving skills, but did find drivers were more easily distracted under the influence. This is significant in which it is not the effects of Marijuana it self that poses the most risk while under the influence, rather the actions of those while driving, now why make the penalty just as severe for someone driving under the influence for something they might do that causes them to be distracted. If this is the case than shouldn't the drivers who get distracted by the radio, or putting make up on be penalized on the same level? My point being, while driving under the influence is as safe as driving sober obviously; the penalty should not be up there with Driving under the influence of Alcohol. The test included ""Volunteers responded to various simulated events, which were associated with automobile crash risk. Those risks included a driver who was entering an intersection illegally, deciding to stop or go through a changing traffic light, responding to a presence of emergency vehicles, avoiding a collision with a dog who entered into traffic and maintaining safe driving during an in-the-car distraction."" Reference; http://www.wfsb.com... 2. ""If legalized, marijuana would being to be mass-produced and large companies would soon dominate the market."" Marijuana is already mass produced in mass quantities, in fact studies find that Marijuana cultivation in the United States alone is valued at approximately $35 Billion, which far surpasses our other major cash crops such as Corn which is valued at approximately just $23 Billion. I agree with you that a major threat to the legalization is marketing from companies interested in making money, but that is not necessarily the case. Marijuana is a different case other than Tobacco. Tobacco companies must put in all those chemicals in their product because Tobacco itself in raw form is very harsh and practically nobody would smoke it, Marijuana is also very special as it can be easily cultivated by an individual also each plant may yield large quantities of Marijuana for the consumer; eliminating the need to buy from Tobacco-like companies marketing Marijuana. Government and Regulation is the key in safe Marijuana, Such as the medicinal Marijuana today in states across the United States that are tested for potency, quality, ect. The mass public is not going to buy a product with the same qualities similar to cigarettes in terms of Addiction, Harmfulness. Companies money would best be spent selling clean, potent Marijuana to stores instead of adding in harmful chemicals. Clean Marijuana would be available everywhere you go anyways so the only way big name Marijuana companies could survive is if they combine Convenience with Potency and Cleanliness, Marijuana is fine to smoke right off the plant after Drying and curing which eliminates the need to add harmful materials into it, it would just be wasted profit at the money they would already be making. 3. 4. ""marijuana is by no means the only drug these black market cartels are responsible for. While legalizing marijuana would certainly decrease gang activity dealing with that particular drug, it would simply shift their focus to other drugs or illicit activities."" To a point I agree, then to a point I disagree. on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana, wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. This was estimated worth of $338 Million. While it is true that the Drug cartels would try to import heavier amounts of different narcotics such as Cocaine and Heroin, the drug market isn't as available as it is with Marijuana. Thus in turn severely crippling drug Cartels. As referenced on this link http://www.druglibrary.org... which states that "" 8,000,000 and 12,000,000 Americans had smoked marijuana at least once."" ""25 percent (2,000,000 to 3,000,000 smokers) were ""social users, smoking marijuana on occasion when it is available, usually in a group context."" and ""The remaining 10 percent or less (800,000 to 1,200,000 marijuana smokers) ""can be considered chronic users who devote significant portions of their time to obtaining and using the drug."" and as referenced in this article http://www.thecyn.com... states ""A 1997 study found that nearly 1.5 million people regularly abuse cocaine"" While that study is outdated I recognize, one of the main reasons Marijuana is not smoked regularly by many Americans is the fact its illegal, legalization would bring more people to Smoke Marijuana thus increasing the amount of money the drug cartels lose compared to the margin they would be making on heavier drugs such as Cocaine and Heroin. Marijuana would make a very big dent in drug Cartel industry. 4. "" The fact that alcohol is legal means it is generally permitted, and endorsing yet another intoxicant does not seem productive."" I generally agree with most of your argument in this section except the quote I just listed. Your statement is correct by logic, but you also are not thinking broader. They're many cannabis users who smoke/ingest Marijuana to genially enhance their senses, let them look at things in a different light, and also to have a good time. Most alcoholics tend to act rationally when under the influence and tend to do drastic things they wouldn't normally do, these side effects can be again enhanced with the use of many Medications to provide sometimes deadly results. I'm not going to turn this into a ""Alcohol is legal so Marijuana should be too debate"" I'm just stating that they're some people who use it for productive activities or to calm an illness they may have, but in many cases the legalization of Cannabis can cause a safer alternative for those who go to drinking as an alternative to breaking the law. But like I said I pretty much agree with most of what my opponent said their I was just making my view clear. All the points I did not hit are because I have very similar beliefs to you. I would like to thank you for reading my argument and I'm looking forward to your rebuttal."	PRO	113

I would like to give a situation now of course this is drastic and I'm not comparing this to marijuana but if we legalized murder there would be a lot less arrests, thus the funding would go down, but there is a problem with legalizing murder.

It is also reported that 41% of students who said they were stoned while reading in school said they couldn't remember what they read. Marijuana also is shown to cause respiratory damage symptoms include - Daily cough - Chronic Bronchitis - More frequent chest colds - Injured lung structures - Pneumonia - and an increased risk of Oral and Lung cancers Marijuana also causes Immune system damage, reproductive system damage, for women danger during pregnancy, emotional damage, intellectual damage, and psychological addiction.

Sc0722593-Ab738490	Marijuana should be legalized for both Medicinal and Recreational use	"Great! Thanks for the quick response. Now it's time to rebut and wrap this up… 1.The fact of the matter is that ""drug-driving"" laws exist already in most states. (http://www.1800duilaws.com...) These laws include the legal drugs you mentioned. Legal drugs that impair coordination are required to state so on their labels, and violating that warning should and does result in a penalty. I still endorse these types of penalties on drivers under the influence of drugs, including marijuana. It's legality is really of no concern in this debate, and I brought it up solely as a way of demonstrating that laws regarding marijuana need to be changed to deal with the actual danger it poses to society, which is that it is an inebriant, not that it's damaging to the user. My entire argument revolves around the fact that marijuana should remain illegal, but the laws governing it should be massively overhauled. We should focus on the aspects of drugs that are actually dangerous and adequately equip our law enforcement with the tools and policies that will have a positive impact on the problem. 2.I also maintain that corporations if given the ability to legally grow and distribute marijuana commercially, would seek the cheapest method without regards to safety. Additionally, I maintain that, because of convenience and cost, most people would purchase their marijuana from these large corporations, thereby exposing themselves to the harmful additives and pesticides used in its production. In essence, legalizing marijuana would make it less safe to consume. 3.My opponent is actually agreeing with me on this point without realizing it. My contention is that we need to drastically change the laws concerning marijuana. As he states, we are jailing non-violent dealers and users, gobbling up resources that could be used much more effectively elsewhere. I agree. Instead of punishing the person who winds up with the product, we need to fight it at the source. The Mexican government is rife with corruption and cartel influence, which means their efforts are doomed to fail. The government may fight one cartel, but another cartel is making the campaign contributions that put that government in office. (http://bigjournalism.com...) What needs to be done to solve this problem? The US must immediately cease funding to the Mexican government for its War on Drugs, and must instead assist the government in gathering genuine intel and demanding that Mexico follow through on it. It is not just Mexico's problem – violence is bleeding over the border, so it's our War too. 4.Pro misinterpreted my argument here, perhaps because it looked like I was making that clichï¿½ reference to the lazy stoner. I was no attempting to make that correlation. I simply wanted to say that government-endorsed unhealthy behavior is not productive. My opponent agrees with me that laws need to be changed to keep users out of jail, and the absurd amount of resources we dedicate to this ‘problem' should be allocated elsewhere.

S349ec7ce-A867c0086	the legalization of marijuana	"to try and go against my opponents arguments i will now try to attack the points he tried to bring down and strengthen them my main points were 1)by taxing marijuana we would profit from it. 2)Legalizing pot would create jobs 3)A lot of people would leave jail. 4)Pot makes people tranquil; that's how we'll establish peace. 5)Pot would only be for people 18+ 6)Pot has medicinal uses. my opponent has made a good argument and i intend on reinforcing my case by adding to my points 1,2,3) by taxing marijuana we would create more jobs look at the world and the possibilities like i said many would grow it in their backyards well that would be a good thing why..they would start their own business selling hemp products and also hemp would have to replace trees making our air cleaner and safer also law enforcer would not be kicked out of their jobs but make it easier for them. for one there would be less crime two) prison systems would be better with the real criminals in them. also my opponent said that many of these people who were freed needed jobs well now with more opportunity they will bc in R1 i stated how marijuana can be used for fuel efficiency, aswell as i have stated many products can be made from it, medicinal creams and aswell paper making jobs at many places in the U.S and he stated that 10% of the population is jobless well if law passes this we would indeed carry out more jobs and also we wont have to pay money to many off sea countries such as china europe etc. so more of the money would stay here in the U.S as well we can see lawyers having an easier time dealing with many marijuana drug cases now and lawyers would never go out of the job there would be many more cases out there other than marijuana jeez. also to attack how many workers will become lazy and incompetent that is a lie. in a work place there would have to be rules and the workers would have to obey them or else they will be fired. this being a good thing. there would be extents to smoking marijuana some places already ban smoking such a illinois, where almost every restaurant denies smoking. so then it would apply to marijuana smokers where as they would want to come to work high but wont be allowed to work, this is a law that any work place would abide by so then it would keep people at work at tip top shape..... 5)i never stated that 18+ would be the only to get it i stated teens. so in reality buy having the chance to purchase marijuana many teens would actually have it out of their reach unless they get the seed which then they could grow themselves but we all know it takes 5-9 months to grow good bud so during that time period many teens and adults would have to go buy it from the local drug store or wherever marijuana will be sold. 6)as we all know marijuana has no side effects and many people would get used to the feeling after a long period of time. unlike cigarettes people can quit smoking marijuana at any given time i have stated that before, and marijuana has no such link to cancer but has indeed helped many cancer patients. Marijuana cigarettes have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and research has shown that THC is more quickly absorbed from marijuana smoke than from an oral preparation as stated in http://www.cancer.gov... also to go against the obesity argument dude their is a worse enemy out there and its called anorexia. marijuana actually helps many of these anorexic beings and saves their lives by giving them the munchies. and many people will learn to control these cravings for ""munchies"" i would know, but also it would help them realize how fat they are and would actually help them out and tell these obese people ""hey lose weight you fatass"" sorry for the language but yes many people would realize it and stop smoking and start dieting. i totally forgot point 4) well at the moment peace tranquility is only but a dream but many people had a dream and look what we have now a black president. may we say that a dream is far from reach...no because no dream is ever far from reach. with marijuana people would be tranquil happy and at peace none will be violent as i stated, law enforcers would have an easier job with marijuana legalized i mean cops have bigger matter to attend to than some dude thats been caught for having 3 ounces of pot on him, i mean there is always a drunk SOB out there that they would have to arrest so that means no law enforcer would lose a job PERIOD! and i affirm todays resolution bc i have attacked my opponent and strengthened my case aswell so you pot smokers of America unite and vote for moi."

S349ec7ce-Af74bfec0	the legalization of marijuana	"Welcome to the site, Pro. To clarify, I am a SHE, not a HE :) Back to the arguments... Pro begins by saying that pot will create jobs because people will start their own hemp businesses. This is an economically unsound argument. Again, since pot would be legal, and people would presumably grow their own to save money, then they're not going to buy it from other people either in the form of marijuana or hemp products. Additionally, you'll notice that Pro agreed that law enforcement and the like would lose their jobs. Pro contends this by saying ""their job would be easier."" Okay? They wouldn't have a job - that's the point. Next Pro argues that people would have jobs as hemp and the like would be used as energy alternatives. The reality is that hemp is not ideal for these things. On the contrary, the increasingly popular solar power, wind power and of course hybrid options are more feasible, practical and effective. Therefore my opponent has been unable to uphold any of his points thus far or negate my own. Moving on, Pro writes that I'm wrong in noting that people would do things like go to work high. I'd like to point out that I never said anything about going to work high. What I did say was that it's a FACT that just as pot is known to make people feel silly, giggly and sleepy, that it's also known to make people lazy, lethargic, apathetic, irresponsible and unproductive. Therefore Pro not only straw manned my argument, but also provided a moot point which is irrelevant. My argument was that these negative impacts DO affect smokers, which is not a contention in favor of legalization. Pro then says something about those 18+ that I couldn't quite comprehend. I think he said that only those over 18 could legally buy it in the drug stores; however, I already said how young people would still be able to acquire it easier if it were legal, which could be considered irresponsible by law makers. Further, once again, people wouldn't have to buy it in the store -- they would grow it. Pro acknowledges that minors would grow it, therefore he concedes this argument to me. Next Pro writes, ""As we all know marijuana has no side effects..."" That is a completely false statement. As I said in my last round, there are significant health risks including weakening people's immune system, increasing the likelihood of mouth cancer (perhaps other kinds of cancer as well), accelerating some of the diseases it's trying to help, progressing the speed of HIV and AIDS, lead to an increase in schizophrenic patients, etc [1]. You'll notice that Pro did not combat these valid points at all, and merely stated that there are no side effects. This is blatantly wrong. Pro continues to say that there are medicinal benefits to marijuana to which I have never disagreed. Instead, I argued that there are also significant risks which could be considered to cancel out any potential benefits. Pro continues to point out that pot is beneficial because while it induces munchies, it's okay because marijuana can provide a cure for anorexia. Haha that's a ridiculous argument with no factual basis, so it should not be taken into consideration on the part of the Pro. And finally, you'll note that Pro failed to demonstrate how smoking pot would lead to world peace. As I said, just because pot makes some people lazy and tranquil doesn't mean that it would solve the world's problems or cure people's mental illness or thirst for power and greed, etc. The resolution once again has been negated.

Sc0722593-A3dc4a6b4	Marijuana should be legalized for both Medicinal and Recreational use	"I would like to thank con for his rebuttal. Reading over it, we see eye to eye on many things. I would like to stress that most of his points he is trying to make however are based solely on opinion with no legitimate sources to back up his arguments. That being said his opinions are relate very closely to mine but as stated in my previous argument they're again some fundamental differences that separates us. 1. No, would legalizing marijuana for recreational use have any impact on lowering the instances of driving while high? No, obviously, however having it illegal will not lower the instances of driving while intoxicated on Marijuana either. The point that I was making is its been proven in fact that driving while intoxicated on Marijuana is substantially safer than driving while intoxicated on Alcohol or other legal prescription drugs such as: Xanax, and Hydrocodone. I do not condone driving under the influence or implying that it is safe, however I am saying that it is significantly safer than other legal narcotics available, I am implying that the punishment for doing so should be no where near classified of that on the same level as Driving under the influence of Alcohol and I see no need for their to be implemented devices to check if someone is intoxicated on Marijuana while driving. 2. Con makes a very valid argument here where he states about his concern with the quality and safeness of Marijuana if it is mass produced by large corporations. I will begin my argument here by pointing out a section in your post in which you state: ""it is legal to grow fruit, and yet local products are still more expensive."" This is a valid point and by theory is correct, fruit and vegetables are legal to grow and yet big corporations still rule the market, by theory this is correct however I feel you are comparing Marijuana too much to Fruit and other foods. The reasons why more people do not grow their own fruits and vegetables is because of time and land. To grow a full sized Apple tree it takes approximately 2-3 years to grow and mature and require a significant amount of land to grow many trees. This plays a big part as Marijuana cultivation takes approximately 6-10 weeks from from seed to harvest and require little amount of land for a large amount of crop which also yields a significant amount of Marijuana. I am not denying the fact that pesticides will not be used in the production of legal Cannabis because they probably will and they are used today, the fact of the matter is they're not necessary to use as pesticides can actually harm the plant as any good grower would no. Cheaper alternatives such as bat guano (http://www.marijuanafertilizers.com...) are great natural non-toxic fertilizers. Con is also neglecting the fact of other alternative growing of Marijuana such as Hydroponics which involves growing the Marijuana in water. As I stated before I cannot refute the fact of Pesticides as a potential hazard in the legalization of Cannabis but I do not think it should have any matter in the fact of Legalization of Cannabis. 3. This is the biggest disagreement that I have had so far with Con's proposal. Where he has made several hypocritical remarks in which he states ""War on Drugs has been ineffective"" and then states ""eliminating the source of these drugs rather than discouraging its use with insane punishments for users."" Most of the illegal plants grown such as Marijuana, Papi (Which produces Opium), and Coca; are significantly grown in 3rd world countries in which we have no control over the production for political reasons, the domestic grow and the war on drugs has also been severely ineffective. The war on Marijuana alone has cost the United States an estimated $42 Billion and 738,916 arrests for simple possession of Marijuana (http://www.alternet.org...), Think of all the things that the United States government could accomplish with an extra $42 billion. turning non-violent offenders into harden criminals and filling up prison cells where violent inmates need to be housed. It takes approximately ï¿½31,106 ($42,000) to house these non-violent inmates on top of that $42 billion. On top of that law enforcement has confiscated and destroyed millions upon millions of plants throughout the year and have not made a dent. The fact of the matter is Marijuana will be cultivated, produced, and sold no matter what the government does, the War on Cannabis is a failure so might as well tap into the money that we would save to pay for more important things like Health care and teachers which we so desperately need. Legalization of marijuana would take billions of dollars away from these drug cartels in fact hurting them more than spending billions of dollars fighting this endless war on drugs which we will never win. We have already been working with every organization possible and it still has had little impact on anything. 4. Con makes a valid point here but is digging way to deep into this when he states that ""Why get an endorphin release from exercise when you can smoke a joint and feel twice as good?"" A recent Government study indicates that over 83 Million people over the age of 12 years old will try Marijuana before they graduate school, and an estimated 200 Million Americans smoke it; on top of another 200 million will try it for the first time, Con is trying to imply that legalization of Marijuana will lead to a nation of ""lazy stoners"" which is simply not the case. The legalization of Marijuana I believe will have little effect on the amount of people who smoke it (But will obviously increase slightly.) Legalization will simply take away the harsh punishments of smoking this benign plant freeing up billions upon billions of dollars, clearing up prison cells in our crowded prisons. I believe if we should endorse anything endorse something that has many benefits, that actually relaxes you, and something that will generate billions of dollars to the economy and have numerous positive effects on the nation as a whole, Prohibition doesn't work, it has never worked, thus why not take advantage of it. Thank you to my readers and to Con, I have had a wonderful time debating with you so far and look forward to your future response. I urge my readers to look over my argument and see the facts that are clearly laid out and see that I am the correct side to vote for! Thank you, I am looking forward to your rebuttal!"	PRO	125

My opponent will probably say, ""well, we'll just let people grow it"", and that's a great idea, put it right in the open for all the youth to get a hold of and become pot heads. Stats show that smoking marijuana leads youths to try worse drugs like crack cocaine and eventual death.

Sf77858a3-Ae7d8bbc6	Marijuana is safer to consume than both alcohol and tobacco	"Government propaganda and other conditioning have led people to believe that marijuana is a dangerous substance, when in actuality, it is safer than both alcohol and tobacco. It is stupid of anyone to think that smoking any kind of plant matter is not dangerous. Any smoke being inhaled into your lungs is in some way bad for you. Sure some substances create much more toxic smoke, but smoking should not be seen as harmless. While saying this, it should be noted that marijuana smoke has been researched and seen as far less dangerous than tobacco smoke. Many studies show that there is no relation in cancer and long-term smoked marijuana(http://www.foxnews.com...). Some studies even show a decrease in cancer tumors showing that it may possibly help slow down cancer(http://www.sciencedaily.com...) It is still true though, that marijuana smoke is in no way 100 percent healthy. This does not say ANYTHING about the safety of marijuana or the compounds contained in the plants. There are many more options of consuming marijuana. These include vaporization and edible forms. Vaporization is heating up the plant to a temperature just enough to vaporize the thc/cbd in the plant, but not enough to burn the plant. This means no smoke will be created at all. Edibles involve baking the marijuana to extract the thc into food such as brownies or butter to be added to food. Now without smoke to worry about, what is dangerous at all about marijuana? Two things can be said. A) It increases your heart rate B) cognitive and physical impairment. Since we are relating the safety of marijuana to alcohol and tobacco, the first argument does not really say anything. This is because alcohol and tobacco also increase your heart rate(http://alcoholism.about.com...)(http://www.acde.org...) The second argument could say that marijuana causes cognitive and physical impairments. Short term memory loss is created with marijuana, but it is only temporary and returns after the drug leaves the body. Physical impairments from it are at a much less extreme than alcohol but slightly higher compared to tobacco. Many people just assume because someone is ""high"", it must be like they are ""drunk"", so of course they can't drive. This is untrue though. Studies have proven that there is very little, if any driving problems associated with marijuana.(http://articles.businessinsider.com...)(http://www.insideline.com...). The last negative health effect associated with drugs would be addiction. Nicotine contained in tobacco is one of the most physically addicting substances that is naturally produced on earth. Alcohol, while less than nicotine, has been studied to also show physical dependency. It is not known the physical dependency of marijuana. It is known that if any at all, it is far less serious than of tobacco or alcohol. People that get addicted to marijuana almost always do so because of a psychological addiction, not physical. You can be psychologically addicted to ANYTHING so this is just a way of saying that they have addictive personality. So basically, the only negative health affects from marijuana in vaporized or edible form are only a increased heart rate and temporary ""high"" effects that do not effect driving nearly as much(if at all) as alcohol. It should be noted that overdose from marijuana resulting in death is impossible. Lets compare this to the negative effects of alcohol. This includes DEATH from overdose, long term kidney damage, loss of brain cells, coma from overdose, large amount of physical dependence, large driving risk, etc. Now lets compare this to tobacco. Note that this is based on smokeless tobacco, where smoke tobacco would of course be more dangerous, but I have to be fair due to talking about vapozed and edible marijuana. Smokeless tobacco comes in either ""dip"" which is still VERY dangerous and causes cancer(http://www.cancer.gov...). It can also be vaporized in ""e-cigarettes"". This is much safer, but nicotine itself is also dangerous, and you would be receiving nicotine. Using these e-cigarretes, the safest form of tobacco has shown to STILL cause cancer(http://health.usnews.com...). It also can cause hives, difficulty breathing, and vomiting(http://www.livestrong.com...). Knowing this information, I find it impossible to believe that marijuana is more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco."	PRO	127

Sdb751e93-A72d392bb	Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.	"My opponent starts off Round 3 by mentioning that the U.S. spends $193 billion on illicit drugs. However, he misses the aboluste crux of his own statistics. This $193 billion is BECAUSE the drugs are ILLICIT in the FIRST place. If we were to legalize pot, a huge percentage of this $193 billion would be taxed and therefore would be fueled back into America's economy. All my opponent says is that the economic costs outweigh the benefits. This is due to a misinterpretation of his own statistic. Furthermore, he fails to refute my own contention about economic benefit. The point is that we can tax marijuana to create bilions of dollars in revenue in every single state of the United States. Furthermore, we will save hundreds of billions of dollars by not locking up nonviolent offenders. This is a costly expense that is not worth it. It is not my fault that my opponent completely misunderstands my second contention. As I stated in the 2nd round and reiterated in the 3rd round, police officers can solve other crimes if they do not make ""smoking pot"" their first priority. If police officers spent their time solving true crimes, like muder and rape, then there would be less danger and violence in society. My opponent has not refuted this contention, either because he misunderstands it or refuses to address it. He goes on about these speculative arguments about why people might or might not be purchasing cannabis, but there is no evidence and no logic. Please let my 2nd contention hold for the rest of the debate. I already presented a statistic from the Drug Policy Alliance, stating that even though blacks are no more likely to use cannabis than their white counterparts, they are 4 times as likely to be arrested for it. My opponent finally comes back with some statistic saying that blacks commit more crimes per capita, but these crimes are not specific to marijuana infractions. They could come from other crimes, such as murder or rape. This makes my opponent's refutation non-topical. My opponent might show that blacks commit more crimes than whites, but he does not show that this is true for marijuana arrests. Clearly, our system of incarceration and criminal justice is very racially skewed against black people, and the only way to fix this is to legalize cannabis so that police officers no longer have an excuse for ""going harder on"" African-Americans. My opponent actually supports my 4th contention without even knowing that he is doing so. YES, marijuana from drug cartels is certainly more dangerous than marijuana from a licensed recreational store, and that is PRECISELY the point of my argument. By legalizing marijuana, the government can watch after marijuana and take away the incentive of violent drug cartels to enter the country and sell sketchy weed. Keeping it above the counter, in the eyes of doctors and enforcement officials, leads to safer weed The only question that the opposition could ask now is: why legalize it in the first place? And, as my opponent has failed to respond to for now 2 rounds, keeping marijuana illegal does NOT deter consumers from using it. I'm not sure why my opponent fails to refute this. As will be a challenge for my opponent for the rest of this debate, just because the government says that something is illegal does not mean that people will not use it (examples: illegal production of alcohol in the 1920's, while it was still prohibited). So, none of my opponent's initial contentions about the health risks of marijuana hold: even if marijuana was unhealthy, keeping it illegal does not solve for this. My opponent again tries to bring up this ridiculous idea that marijuana can kill you. I already struck down this contentoin when I mentioned that marijuana has led to zero recorded deaths in all of human history. It is not dangeorus as my opponent wants voters to believe. Quite to the contrary, marijuana has powerful medicinal benefits, such as its ability to cure anxiety, pain, stress, insomnia, and the symptoms of cancer. My opponent's claim that any kind of smoke contanis carcinogens is blatantly untrue. I would ask voters to hold him accountable to irrefutable evidence for the next round, however it is too late in the debate for that. My opponent also has no meaningful response to my last contention. Americans should be able to do whatever they want, provided that what they are doing does not infringe upon the rights of others. All my opponent says is that ""it goes against the rights of others"". There is not a single reason, let alone any piece of evidence, to believe that this is true. Private marijuana use within one's own home should not be the concern of anyone else, because it does not harm anyone else (and, as I have shown, it doesn't even hurt the person who is using it). My opponent makes some speculative argument that cannabis can lead to other crimes, but he has still not shown any viable evidence for this. I appreciate my opponent's effort, however he has failed to maturely or convincingly refute any of my 5 contentions. Legalizing weed creates money, saves money, solves other crimes, reduces institutional racism, creates a safer society, and promotes basic freedoms to which responsible Americans should be entitled. Even though my opponent tries to say otherwise, marijuana is not harmful, and it does not lead to increased crime."	PRO	129
Sdb751e93-Add6a8e40	Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.	"Rebuttals: ""Contention 1: Economic Benefits. Legalizing pot allows the United States to allow a wealth of economic benefits in the form of tax revenue and also in the form of liberating costly prisoners from incarceration. We have already seen examples of collecting revenue. According to the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), between January 2014 and October 2014, Colorado accrued 40 million dollars of tax revenue by legalizing marijuana and allowing 21+ citizens to purchase it. Suppose that we extrapolated legalization to the whole country. According to the Huffington Post, this would result in $8.7 billion per year in the form of state and federal taxes. Taxing any good or service allows the economy to grow, because it provides money that is uesd for other programs. In the case of marijuana legalization, these programs translate to education, health care, and drug addiction treatment, valuable impacts in our society. Furthermore, legalizing marijuana prevents costs that are associated with incarcerating individuals. According to the DPA, approximately 750 thousand citizens are arrested for an infraction of marijuana law each year. Furthermore, the cost of incarceration is $47,000 per prisoner per year. This translates to 7 to 10 billion dollars per year that are wasted on locking up stoners (rather than rapists or murderers). Clearly, not only does legalizing marijuana create money; keeping it illegal costs money. This 35 billion dollars could be used to reduce the national deficit, solve other crimes, or perhaps reduce taxes on American citizens."" This is only the money the US gets from the tax revenue, and this is nothing compared to the amount of money spent on substance abuse. The U.S spends about $193 billion on illicit drugs, so the economic benefits are outshined by the drawbacks. ""Contention 2: Legalizing marijuana reduces crime. Legalizing marijuana prevents police officers from wasting their time arresting harmless stoners, when they could be spending these efforts and resources fighting actually dangerous crimes, such as murder, theft, or rape. According to RollingStone Magazine, marijuana arrests are no longer real ""police work"";"" My source says otherwise, but do not forget, Colorado is one out 4 states that have no restrictions on marijuana, so tell me, how is it known that other states won't have people committing crimes too. Lots of these cops said that they arrested the smokerrs due to possession alone, and they most likely haven't smoked enough to become depressed, anxious, or want to commit crimes, like what is happening in Colorado. As Pro, you need to prove that legalizing marijuana would be beneficial in all of those states. ""Legalizing marijuana reduces or eliminates racial discrimination in law enforcement. It should be clear to the layperson that most marijuana arrests are against racial minorities, particularly blacks. A black individual is no more likely to use pot than a white person but, in Washington D.C., is over 8 times more likely to be arrested for it."" Well I will lay some statistics on you, proportionally, blacks cause more crimes than whites do. Not in actuality, but mainly because there are more whites than blacks in this country. Whites make up 63.7% of the U.S population, while blacks make up 12.2%. However, annually whites have an average of 6,484,507 victimizations, and blacks have 4,091,971. Again, the whites have more people, so of course they will have more victimizations, but they have more than 5 times the population of blacks in the U.S, but don't even have twice as many victimizations, and so with the smaller percentage blacks have, they are actually more likely to commit crimes or be accused of one's than a white. Also while there have been confirmed biases against black people by cops, I don't think that nullifies every single case for it, as I don't see proof of that, and I have demonstrated blacks are more likely to commit a crime. "" keeping it illegal does not deter its use. In fact, the criminal nature of cannabis provides a compelling reason for drug cartels to enter the country and sell cannabis, with no regard to whether the weed is tainted with dangerous chemicals like PCP. Since the illegality of marijuana fails to have any deterrent effect, legalizing pot will allow the government to closely control and regulate it."" If drug cartels come to America, wouldn't that mean that a) marijuana use will be increased? and b) it's likely that the marijuana will be unhealthy? The Drug cartels are not our government, so I doubt they would regulate it. They just want money. And how will the regulations help? It might decrease a few deaths, however, any kind of smoke contains carcinogens, which can give you cancer and destroy your lungs. Are they going to guarantee that it doesn't release smoke? It is still dangerous and can lead to death if this isn't the case. ""Americans have freedom of choice. An American citizen should be able to do whatever she want, so long as her actions do not infringe upon the rights of others."" Marijuana can lead to committing a bunch of crimes, which does lead to users infringing the right of others, correct? This tramples the freedom in others, and as I have said, what makes you think it is safe to legalized pot across the U.S? If it goes against the rights of others, and marijuana is the cause, then marijuana shouldn't be legal. It is simple.

Its like saying something is food it does not really say much. Where saying it is a schedule one substance does give information Speaking of drugs ratings the DEA defines schedule one as ""drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"" It treats pain, and would be acceptable if it was not illegal. making it more of a schedule two, and plenty of schedule 2 drugs are legal. If they are similar they are not completely different, they are similar. Also the hole point of taking a pain killer is to alter you perception so you are not in pain. For a lot of people they want there perception changed. You are right in that I will say freedom of choice, because it is one of the most important things people have. Back to the schedule 2 drugs, both cocaine and Ritalin are schedule 2 drugs. you said ""it's not the same as Ritalin or else that would be illegal as well."" this tells me you did not understand the point I was making they are funcataily and chemically very similar but one is looked at as this horrible and criminal, but both are legal for medical uses in the united states.

People drink for fun, people eat for fun there is no harm in them getting a little high for fun I will also inform you that older generations did indeed get wasted, there have been drunks for a very long time. There where plenty of vets who did drugs after the Vietnam war. basically if there have been drugs people have wanted to do them. ""In the end it is free choice of the states. If people want It that bad, then it will be legalized."" This is a line of yours that fully agree with and in Washington, Colorado, and Organ they have made there choice and many states will follow in there footsteps. Wright and Wrong are subjective. Free will let people make stupid or smart decisions but the important thing is they made there decisions It is legal in the before listed states and the consequences seem to be small. there are still plenty of smart people in theses states some of whom still most likely use cannabis For people how do not believe in an after-life worldly pleasures are the best thing a person can seek after. The states have freedom of religion so religion should not play a role in the law. If your religion says that you should not do a thing do not do that thing you don't have to stop other people.

Sdb751e93-Ace8efbaf	Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.	I shall begin my case. Contention 1: Marijuana is dangerous Marijuana has negative side effects when individuals are exposed to it for both short term and long term periods of usage. It distorts your senses, can make you panic, give you anxiety, and increase the rate of your heartbeat, which risks a chance of a heart attack, and since heart attacks are lethal, this means that Marijuana can kill you overtime. Marijuana distorts both you both physically and psychologically. It can make you depressed, reduce your sexual capacity, reduce illness resistance in your body, and destroy your lungs fibers which could potentially be permanent. It also can give you psychosis and schizophrenia. Bronchitis and lung infections are also negative effects you can get from this lethal substance. But worst of all, it increases risk of cancer. It increases amount of cell mutations in your body and when the users smoke them, they inhale carcinogens, which have been scientifically proven to give you cancer by either manipulating your dna directly or increasing the rate of cells dividing, which increases chances of cancerous cells forming. The worst part of Marijuana is the simple fact that it contains up to 50-70% more of the cancer causing substances than tobacco does, and it can cause the same amount of damage as FIVE cigarettes being smoked one at a time. All of the above I have stated are negative effects Marijuana can give you, and we shouldn't allow a drug that is dangerous or lethal, as it causes an unnecessary amount of pain to those who are exposed to it, and each single period of time smoking marijuana is much worse than a single period of time of smoking tobacco. Contention 2: In Colorado, pot increased the crime rate From 2004 to 2012, crime rate in Colorado decreased by 32%, that is until pot was legalized, because once it was, crime rate was increased by 21% in just 2 years, with an average of 10.5% per year, whereas the crime rate from 2004 to 2012 decreased at a rate of 4% per year. If crime rates are increasing now with marijuana faster than it was decreasing, then Colorado has a problem. The rate could keep increasing of it is not stopped, and the problem is, this is just Colorado. Imagine if every state allowed people to smoke weed. There are only 4 states in the U.S that have 0 restrictions on Marijuana, while there are 22 states where Marijuana is illegal. Would you want to risk increasing crime rates in all of those states, not even counting the states that have heavy restrictions on Marijuana? Marijuana hurts both the users and the people around the users because as I have demonstrated, it has more cancer causing toxins than tobacco, can give you lung infections which destroy them, can make you depressed and anxious, and it can increase the likelihood of you committing a crimes. Marijuana is clearly not a safe substance, and therefore, it should remain illegal.

Saaec8cf8-A96168ce6	The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States.	"Alright, first off i'd like to apologize for providing such a lengthy argument, and not getting to all of my opponent's and my own points. I'll try to keep this shorter for all of you. So, first off I'll get right down to his points in his most recent argument. Point 1: ---""Both my opponent and I posted many sources explaining why marijuana was banned."" This is false. My opponent's sources explain how smoking marijuana can be harmful. They did not explain how it was outlawed, or why it was outlawed. I can guarantee you that this information was not available in the years from 1914 to the 1920s, when it was banned. The surgeon general's warning for cigarettes did not even come out until 1954. There was no research or evidence to conclude that smoking (anything, not just cigarettes or weed) was as harmful as it can be. Marijuana was not banned because evidence pointed to it being bad for you. I urge voters to read the links i provided in my first argument on this topic, and conduct research outside of the links my opponent and I have provided. But, as my opponent also pointed out, this is not as important as why it should be legalized now. The purpose in issuing this argument was to dispel myths in people's heads that marijuana was banned on a medical and scientific basis. But, onward! To the modern day! Point 2: He points out that I stated that marijuana has medical properties, but is harmful when smoked. He misconstrues these to mean this: ---""So, we have a pain killer that has poor side effects."" I say he ""misconstrues"" for two reasons: a) First, he makes it sound like the sole purpose of marijuana is to kill pain. There are many other uses, including medical, religious, and recreational. b) Second, he says marijuana has poor side effects. SMOKING marijuana has poor side effects, as I stated earlier, and as he and his sources ignore. I'll say it again: smoking is only one way to use marijuana, and it is not the best way. Vaporizers will allow more THC content to reach you, and eliminates the smoke. Eating it (often in baked goods, or almost any recipe with butter) also eliminates smoke. There are many ways to use weed, and smoking is not the best. The reason it is so popular is because of marijuana's illegality. It is easier to hide and takes less time and preparation. He then again raised the point that there are numerous pain killers with no side effects. Please, do tell. I have yet to hear of many medicines that have NO side effects. When he raises this point, however, he again fails to recognize that marijuana has more purposes than killing pain, and that you do NOT have to smoke marijuana to benefit from it. As i have stated, marijuana can be used for many purposes. Here are a few: -------- The following applications for marijuana have all been at least once, if not more, been deemed legitimate by one or more legislatures, courts, and/or government agencies: *HIV/AIDS: Marijuana can reduce the nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite caused by the ailment itself and by various AIDS medications *Glaucoma: Marijuana can reduce interlobular pressure, thereby alleviating the pain and slowing -- and sometimes stopping -- the progress of the condition. (Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. It damages vision by increasing eye pressure over time.) *Cancer: Marijuana can stimulate the appetite and alleviate nausea and vomiting, which are common side effects of chemotherapy treatment. *Multiple Sclerosis: Marijuana can limit the muscle pain and spasticity caused by the disease, as well as relieving tremor and unsteadiness of gait. (Multiple sclerosis is the leading cause of neurological disability among young and middle-aged adults in the United States.) *Epilepsy: Marijuana can prevent epileptic seizures in some patients. *(and now my opponent's favorite) Chronic Pain: Marijuana can alleviate the chronic, often debilitating pain caused by myriad disorders and injuries. ________ Many patients also report that marijuana is useful for treating arthritis, migraine, insomnia, menstrual cramps, alcohol and opiate addiction, and depression and other debilitating mood disorders. * Some religions use marijuana and/or other drugs in services and rituals * Recreational use I urge the reader, voter, and my opponent to take a look at these: http://www.letfreedomgrow.com... http://www.letfreedomgrow.com... http://www.letfreedomgrow.com... Also, I would like to point out that many pain-killers that are commonly prescribed are highly addictive and can be highly dangerous and harmful (i.e. opiates especially). They are also reported in many cases to have negative effects on the patients' regular daily routines in life. You don't need to worry about these things using marijuana. You can overdose on many of these prescription medicines. You can become physically addicted to these medicines. Marijuana is not physically addicting and you cannot overdose on it. Marijuana has tremendous potential for medical use, among other purposes. Do not allow rhetoric and lies to get in the way of the facts. Marijuana is safer than many medicines commonly used. It is safer than legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco. It has its detrimental qualities, but its benefits far outweigh them. Point 3: The war on drugs is a downright failure. The war on pot is a war on personal freedom. Using marijuana does not infringe on anyone else's rights. It harms no one else. If the government wants to save lives, it would do better to regulate what people eat than keep them from using weed. Marijuana is harmful. But it is harmful to such a small extent that risk is minimal, especially if not smoked. Use it responsibly, and it is perfectly okay. Marijuana has medicinal benefits. Do not keep others from using medicine because you believe one should not be intoxicated, high, drunk, baked, booming, rolling, cheesing, stoned, or whatever. Whose rights are infringed on here? (the responsible user, that's who) The war on drugs is an expensive failure too. Billions of dollars have been spent on it fruitlessly. If weed was legalized, we would push money lost into money gained, through tax revenue, and through new jobs. Now, i would like to address his question posed in his first argument. ---""Why should marijuana be legalized for adults, but not children?"" Because children should not be making this major decision early in life, and any negative effects can be expanded through use in early life, while still developing. For the same reasons alcohol and tobacco are outlawed. Risk of irresponsible use and harm is diminished when used after fully developing mentally and physically. ______________________________________Bottom Line:_________________________________________________ Legalizing marijuana pushes taxpayer money being spent on fighting it into tax revenue and profit. Legalizing marijuana creates a safer way and environment to use it. Legalizing marijuana affords users and patient the much-deserved rights to medication, religious practice, and personal freedom. Marijuana is safer than legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco, as well as an excellent alternative to other medicines, like potentially addictive and fatal painkillers. It is a tremendous show of hypocrisy on the government's part to allow tobacco and alcohol use to continue, yet it demonizes marijuana. It ain't poison. It ain't a miracle drug. It's a drug that deserves to be legalized. Legalize it! /Chuckles _________________________________________________________________________________________________ PS: technically, this is the bottom line of my argument^^^"	PRO	133

As I am sure you have seen, the three main points are debated back and forth. You can decide for yourself what you believe on these points, as there is a large amount of evidence for both sides. I will address his ""second to last"" line. ""Legalizing marijuana pushes taxpayer money being spent on fighting it into tax revenue and profit. "" The ""tax-payer"" money is spent on funding the police force. One of the jobs of the police is to stop trafficing of illegal substances. There is no money being spent specifically on fighting the drug, rather on the police. ""Legalizing marijuana creates a safer way and environment to use it."" Safer? Sure, now that the government sponsers it, its safe. Go figure. ""Legalizing marijuana affords users and patient the much-deserved rights to medication, religious practice, and personal freedom.""

If you would like to look into it further, please see my sources. Personal freedom: Here is the thing. My right to swing my fist ends where Chuckle's nose begins. Marijuana has been the cause of crime, and infringement of others rights due to the numbing of senses. Is legalizing this really protecting personal freedom?

S4291ec8-A11c9ac8f	The legalization of Marijuana is likely to have a more favorable impact than current policy	"My premise is simple: The legalization of marijuana would have a more favorable impact on our country than the current policy. I present the following arguments: 1. Legalization allows for better regulation, improvement of quality, reduction in street prices, and would alienate street dealers. 2. Regulation rather than criminalization provides a better medium for control of access to minors, including stiffer punishments for providers and dealers who contribute to the delinquency of minors. 3. Legalization would allow law enforcement to concentrate on hard drugs and violent crime (this includes DEA, ATF, FBI, Coast Guard, Customs, INS, and local law enforcement). 4. Legalization would provide safer environments for recreational users as well as pharmaceutical users. 5. Legalization would allow for an improved hemp industry which is currently hampered by a ban on all ""cannabis"" strains for fear that higher THC strains will be grown amongst the lower THC ""hemp"" strains. 6. Legalization and regulation would provide a bountiful source for new taxes- industrial, recreational, and medical. 7. Legalization would allow for more efficient studies which would lead to strains that can be disease specific. 8. Legalization would eat away at the monopoly pharmaceuticals have on harder prescription drugs that are actually less effective and more harmful than marijuana when used to treat certain diseases, ie. Fentanyl (a form of morphine) vs. MJ for fibromaelgia, scoliosis, and other painful diseases; Xanax vs. MJ for anxiety; Purcocet (another opioid like Fentanyl and often used in conjuntcion with), Vicodin, and others vs. MJ for pain. 9. Legalization would allow for lower pharmaceutical prices making it easier for patients to medicate and justify the expense which is sometimes smoked up by non-patient family members (like any other pharmaceutical). 10. Legalization would free up about 60,000 jail cells reserved annually for non-violent recreational users of marijuana. I await my opponent's response..."	PRO	135

S629701cf-Ab6e33b1b	Marijuana should be legalized in the US.	I fully understand the implications of legalizing drugs. My mother, in fact, is addicted to Nicotine. Long story short, banning it doesn't help and legalizing it could lower the number of drug uses. Let me explain.. Our current system is flawed. When we tried regulating products that create math, they used alternative methods. When we regulated those, we got drugs from Mexico. It simply doesn't work. And then we put them to jail. In 2009 alone we spent 2 billion on sending them to jail. That's roughly 22,000 dollars per prisoner. In 2007, 13 percent of all arrests were drug related. Now all of this may seem small in the grand scheme of things. Well if we decriminalized drugs we would save around 50 billion dollars total. Now onto the health effects. After making it illegal, drugs became more dangerous. Then there's the violence. We have seen a spike in violence because of it as drug cartels can't settle agreements through the legal system. According to some studies crime is 25 percent higher because of the war on drugs. So how do we fix this? First, legalize it. The war on drugs isn't helping anyone. Next, use the Swiss modeling the 1980's, the Swiss had a heroin epidemic. HIV rose, street crime rose, and so did poverty. What did they do? They opened heroin maintenance centers. Here's the logic: You get free, high quality heroin, clean needles, showers, beds, safe injection rooms and medical supervision. In return you have to try to stop with the help of doctors and social workers will get you a house and job. The results were amazing. HIV went down, so did crime, drug use lowered, and so did the number of heroin overdoses. Two thirds of all admitted became your average drug free workers. And on top of all of that, it was cheaper. TL;DR: The war on drugs doesn't work and we should use the Swiss model which lowered overdoses, crime, and HIV rates while also being cheaper. Sources: https://youtu.be... https://youtu.be...	PRO	137
S4291ec8-A27b1ddb6	The legalization of Marijuana is likely to have a more favorable impact than current policy	"First of all, let me state that my opponent's arguments are not scientifically sound, and are more in tune with the ""Reefer Madness"" myths. I will dispell some of these myths (with scientific, experiencial, and testimonial evidence). Furhtermore, you are not debating, rather asking me to educate you on the issue (which isn't a bad thing), but you shouldn't be opposed to something without doing the proper research. Let me attack each point specifically, as I am not a good debater and this seems to be my best method: ""How would lower street prices help?"" -Lower street prices would make the dealers less competative. They would be forced to seek legal means of growth and distribution. Most are already WILLING to distribute legally, but are not allowed to. Legal grow houses would allow for regulation of safer growing environments (not that they're unsafe, rather from law enforcement) which would provide LEGAL income to those employed, as well as taking them out of the ""underground"" where they currently stand for the most part. Given the controlled quality of legal marijuana, many street dealers have already lost competitiveness, and users are for the most part aquiring marijuana (in California for instance) through dispensiaries. ""That means people will still go for the more dangerous version on the streets because it's cheaper dealers would not decrease they would increase."" -Prices would fall over all. Not only that, but the majority of users are about quality and would rather pay more for less good quality, than less for low quality which has more undesired side-effects like tiredness which is not the result of THC, rather other cannabinoids found in marijuana. ""It's just like a bootleg DVD the quality may not be as good but it's cheaper."" -Many people who watch bootlegs are after the ""experience"" of the movie, not the byproducts associated with marketing the movie like sound, visual effects, etc. If they ARE after that they go to the movies, by an entertainment system, by the DVD, etc. These are people who are concerned about quality (as the majority of users). ""We supposedly regulate alcohol and give stiff punishment to those who give alcohol to minors but it doesn't seem to be stopping minors from getting it how would this be any different?"" -You can't ""stop"" minors from getting ANYTHING, you can only try to control, reduce, and educate. Regardless of whether or not stiffer laws have ""stopped"" minors from getting alcohol or tobacco or not, there has been a reduction in minor use(http://www.cdc.gov... http://www.cdc.gov...). ""Marijuana is just as much a harmful drug as all the others."" -Not true. (http://www.drugwarfacts.org...) Though marijuana has probably a 10,000 plus year history, there is not one documented death attributed to marijuana use. ""A drug that affects your dopamine levels so that you're always content on how things are no matter how bad things are or how sick you are seems pretty dangerous to me."" -You're right, but marijuana does not have that effect, and YOU have the burden of proving this claim (since you made the claim). ""There is no such thing as a safe environment when it comes to weed."" -Home is the safest environment possible. ""If you get hooked it's over and if you have legal access to if you might as well give up your house and family now because if you're always happy and content you won't care about going to work, you won't care about what's going on in the family and you won't care about life because you'll be to busy being happy."" -No offense, but this is a very ridiculous claim. Let me give you a list of very wealthy marijuana users who have not ""given up their house, family, etc."" because they're ""always happy"": Woody Harrelson, Willie Nelson (who recently persuaded Bush to endorse research), Montel Williams (an ardent medical use advocate and user), George Clooney, Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Anniston, Larry Hagman, Stephen King, Bruce Willis, Oliver Stone, Aaron Carter, Madonna, Richard Branson (the BILLIONAIRE), Johnny Depp, Prince Charles (yes, THE Prince Charles), George Washington Carver, Brad Pitt, John Sinclair, Jack Nicholson, Arnold Scwarzenneger, etc. etc. etc.- O, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and many others! ""Who's going to do the regulation and taxes when there all high."" -The United States Department of Agriculture. ""the only thing this drug can be used for in medicine is for pain relief and should still be used only in the worst of the worst situations."" -Not true. Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs, primarily THC, for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. The psychological effects of cannabinoids, such as anxiety reduction, sedation, and euphoria can influence their potential therapeutic value. Those effects are potentially undesirable for certain patients and situations and beneficial for others. ""I mean at least those don't make you think the sky is purple down is up and that signs are staring at you."" -Marijuana doesn't do this. You can, however, loose all inhibitions when using alcohol and ""blackout"" to the point where the next day you don't even remember what you did. Other drugs have a similar effect. Marijuana does not. ""That is an over exaggeration most prescription medicine is not shared with the family"" -I didn't mean ""shared"". (http://www.mediacampaign.org...) This file shows how prescription drug use by children 12-20 is as prevalent, if not more, than marijuana use in the same age range. Where are they getting those drugs? On top of that (as referenced earlier), prescription drugs are as much as 30,000 times more dangerous than marijuana. ""Yes it would free up 60,000 jail cells but fill many more hospital beds and graves because even though it's almost impossible to overdose the weed can still hurt you and others"" -I have shown statistics proving marijuana is nowhere near as dangerous as you paint it... ""Any person with a touch of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder would wig out whether they smoked the weed or inhaled the second hand smoke because of their chemical imbalance and the dopamine inducing effect of the drug. And since some of them are violent this could end badly for them and those around them and don't for get about all the other mental disorders that go undiagnosed and untreated."" -I read that study and you are misquoting it, however, since you brought it up it is your burden to prove your statements. You didn't read the study, you are quoting media hype over a recent study. The media hype ignored certain factors within the study... like the fact that all those studied were schizophrenic! It did not compare the effects in SANE individuals. Bipolar Disorder is one of the diseases for which marijuana is mostly prescribed... so unless you are an MD challenging the word of thousands of other American MD's, then you are just simply wrong. ""If we lost all stress nothing would get done and that includes the things needed to keep the house and feed yourself you cold starve your self to death and never know. That is dangerous probably the most dangerous side effect there is."" -My friend, you are very misinformed on the effects of marijuana. This is tantamount to me arguing that the moon is made of cheese because I was told it was. It's true- many lazy people use marijuana, but that is not to say marijuana users are lazy. If they were all lazy then the percentage of users wouldn't go up with education. High Times and countless other magazines wouldn't be published continuously on time.

This if the person has been regularly abusing marijuana since childhood, or to those who have a specific variant of the AKT 1 gene. [1] AKT 1 gene is a gene that controls the dopamine output. Dopamine is the chemical released during pleasuring activities (sex, eating chocolate, being in love...). If there is a defect in this gene, then yes, marijuana can cause depression, suicidial thoughts etc. There is also a special version of the gene for COMT which is a gene that produces the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase. This enzyme degrades the neurotransmiters, such as dopamine, in your brain and helps to control the level of certain hormones.[2] If you have a defect, you are screwed. No weed for you young man. So if your genes aren't retarded, you are okay. You can smoke weed if you aren't a weird mutant. And yes, use since childhood can cause IQ deficiencies. But you forgot one fact. Most liberals, like me (I think), also want the drug regulated. THC for example, the compound that causes the high, should be regulated. There are canaboids that do decrease the effects of THC [3], but I believe it is safer to just regulate the dosage. And many studies have proven as you have said that weed has a greater effect on teens than on adults. That is why we have regulations. We should set up a regulation to 21+ years, like with alcohol or porn. Now, you may say: ""Well teens can buy alcohol and watch porn way below the age of 21."" Yes they can. They can also buy illegal, enhanced weed from that shady guy that lies in the dumpster and makes airplane noises. This way, they will buy marijuana which is neither as addicting, nor as potent.

Saaec8cf8-A5668bfa	The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States.	"I apologize if it was lengthy. I'm only attempting to fully explore and explain all points and arguments. I believe debate is better when more than simply tag lines and catch phrases are exchanged; so I'm only trying to make the debate as fun and stimulating as possible for you and I as well as the readers. As you say, there is a large amount of evidence for both sides, and plenty of room for debate. This will be my last arguments, and then we're on to the voting period. Good luck to Con! First I'll rebut his most recent arguments. He starts by addressing my point that legalization of cannabis would create revenue for the government. _____________""There is no money being spent specifically on fighting the drug, rather on the police.""______________ The taxpayer money is allocated to police forces and law enforcement, correct. But they spend much of that money fighting drugs (and the bulk of this goes to fighting marijuana, as it is the most popular illicit drug). In fact, they spend billions of dollars (up to and beyond $50 billion). http://www.mapinc.org... http://www.drugpolicy.org... If it was legalized and taxed similarly to alcohol or tobacco, cannabis would create great revenue for the government as well as move and create legitimate jobs. Cannabis is California's #1 cash crop, and has been reported to be the #1 cash crop in America, at least in the top three. If the government taxed these billions of dollars changing hands, it would make estimated billions more. Thus legalization would move money from poorly spent budgets to increased revenue and economic growth. __________""Sure, now that the government sponsers it, its safe. Go figure.""_______________ Once again, this point has been misunderstood or deliberately misconstrued by my opponent. The fact that it would be safer lies not in its legal status, but in how it is traded and in terms of purity. As I stated ALREADY, marijuana has been reported to sometimes be laced with more harmful drugs. If the government regulated marijuana as it does tobacco and alcohol, purity, and yes, SAFETY would be ensured. Also, you would not have to associate with drug dealers and criminals in dangerous parts of town to get drugs, they would be in a safe environment much like a liquor store. Thus acquiring and using the drug would be a safer and easier matter. Next he rebuts my points that legalization would afford users the rights to medication, religious practice, and personal freedom. He says that I only address the medical and personal freedom points. What more is there to say about religious practice? Some religions use marijuana in sacraments and rituals and whatnot. The government denies them the right to practice their religion by using this substance! Yes, medical marijuana was already discussed, but there are four rounds, and I think it appropriate to continue debate and conversation beyond the initial ""my sources say this"". My opponent has not done so. He only claims to have addressed it. That he hardly did. He showed sources that say SMOKING marijuana is bad for you. Even the MD's testimony only refers to SMOKING marijuana, not other use. When will my opponent, and the rest of the world, stop ignoring that you can use marijuana by means other than smoking! I have already stated this. Before i jump to personal freedom, i will move on to the next point he addresses, as they can easily be lumped together. ""Do you still not realize that marijuana is one of those ""fatal painkillers?"" THIS is hypocrisy! Again, please see my sources."" Do you still not realize that marijuana ISN'T fatal? It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana! Once again, the most dangerous aspect of cannabis is smoking it, and YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMOKE TO ENJOY WEED'S EFFECTS. Other LEGAL painkillers and medicines have more serious side effects, greater potential for addiction, and actually HAVE potential for overdose. How often are Percocet, Loratab, Oxycontin, Oxycodone, and other dangerous substances prescribed? Every single day. Marijuana would NOT be near the top of the list of dangerous medicines. Also, as several patients whose links I referenced last round confirm, many for varying reasons cannot or should not use other medicines. _____""Marijuana has been the cause of crime, and infringement of others rights due to the numbing of senses.""______ Marijuana is associated with crime simply because of its illegal status. Users often must associate with criminals and other dangerous people to get the drug. If it was legal, you would not need to visit criminals to get weed. Marijuana is not the cause of infringement of others' rights. If it is, as my opponent claims, how? And if it is, so what? So is alcohol. Alcohol is associated with much worse impairment of judgment and senses than weed. Cops will attest, many a drunk person resist arrest or worse due to poor judgment from being drunk. They get in more fights and struggles arresting drunks than potheads. Even think of the stereotypical stoner compared to the drunk. The stoner is lazy and laid-back, and not violent. The drunk is rambunctious and often violent, and only calms down when he's passed out. Marijuana is less dangerous and unhealthy than both alcohol and tobacco, no matter how you view it. As I close, I would like to state that my opponent seems to only reference his first points and sources rather than seriously argue my points. He misconstrued or misunderstood one or more points twice, even after i made it abundantly clear what was meant. He failed to show that marijuana is dangerous when not smoked. He failed to show why marijuana, a safer and healthier substance than alcohol or tobacco, should be illegal while booze and smokes are legal, and kill thousands of Americans annually. Marijuana kills no one.

It would result in a huge increase in government tax revenue and more jobs.

S1b53d7af-A5ad90b59	Recreational Drugs should be Legalized	"Before I refute your arguments, I would just like to thank you for accepting this debate, magpie. 1) ""I agree that recreational drugs are widely traded and used on the black market, you fail to substantiate that black marketeers profit unduly from the fact of the illegality."" The logic here is very simple, and the history of alcohol prohibition has shown it to be accurate as well. If there is a demand for a product that is legal, the vast majority of people will prefer to purchase it by legitimate means. It is true that there is a black market for legal goods, but it is pale in comparison to the black market for illegal goods. When alcohol was prohibited, organized crime rapidly expanded. After prohibition was lifted, they moved on to supplying the drugs which had recently become illegal under the Federal Narcotics Act, but they shrank in size as these drugs don't have the demand that alcohol does. If those drugs were made available through legal means, their funds would dwindle even further. ""This is equivalent to saying that making rape illegal causes pimps to make more money in prostitution."" That's absolutely ridiculous. The equivalent would be saying that making prostitution illegal would cause pimps to make more money, and that is true. The prostitutes of the Red Light District in Amsterdam are much cleaner and safer than their illegal counterparts in cities with less lenient laws. Cleaner because condoms are mandatory, a policy that is only enforceable if the establishment is legal and regulated. Safer because the streets are lined with police ensuring that none of the women are raped or injured. Instead of being ""protected"" by pimps, these women are protected by the police. 2) ""In this justification you have put money ahead of the ruined lives of addicts, their families and society."" No, this point was simply to show how legalization would benefit the economy. If you look at my other points, you will see that legalization will not ruin the lives of addicts and their families. Perhaps I should have saved this point for last. 3) I would agree that more severe punishments for drug smugglers makes sense, but I will still argue that they will not go away, regardless of how harsh the penalties are against them, until the demand for illegal drugs dissipates, and that will only happen if there is a legal means of obtaining these drugs for the people who are addicted to them. 4) It's interesting that you bring up Switzerland, perhaps you should have done some more research on them. From what I've read, their policy of providing heroin to those who are addicted, by a doctors prescription, has been very successful in reducing usage rates and their model has since been adopted by cities in Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Canada, to name a few. Since the practice was adopted in 1994, heroin related deaths have decreased by more than half, the number of new heroin users decreased from 850 in 1990 to 150 in 2002, the transmission of aids and substance abuse related crimes have also decreased. Perhaps most importantly, ""'In Switzerland, the medicalisation of heroin use has helped change the image of users: from rebels to losers,' Nordt said. 'In the eyes of the young, they're mostly just sick people, forced to get medical help.'"" The best way to reduce the rate of future addictions is to convince kids that drugs aren't cool, and it seems that treating addicts as people in need of medical help is having precisely that effect. http://www.swissinfo.org... For very dangerous and addictive drugs like heroin, the Swiss model of providing them through a doctors office and allowing for controlled use seems to work very well. However, drugs with no severe health risk, like marijuana, should be legalized and distributed in a manner similar to alcohol. There is absolutely no reason why marijuana should be illegal while alcohol and cigarettes remain on the open market. I don't want to get too much into marijuana, for that is a debate in itself, but I will quickly say that alcohol and tobacco both exhibit qualities that are many times worse than those of marijuana and so it is very hypocritical of our government to allow the sale of these substances while prohibiting marijuana. 5) There is one final point that I would like to make that I should have made in my first argument for why addictive, high-risk drugs need to be made available through legal means: to protect children and teens. As it stands right now, the best place to find illegal drugs in suburban towns are in high schools. When I was in high school, the most difficult drug to obtain was alcohol. The only way I could get alcohol was if someone had a parent or older sibling willing to buy it for them. On the contrary, I could get any drug that I wanted from dealers in school. By moving drugs from the illegal to the legal market, you put drug dealers out of business and out of schools."	PRO	144
S1b53d7af-Adfecb056	Recreational Drugs should be Legalized	"Thank you for the kind words, magpie. I'm glad you decided to post a rebuttal, I thought you were going to forfeit the round. ""I deduce from your handle, your choice of presidentiial candidate, and your choice of sources, that your interests are more related to your personal preferences than a desire to rid society of the drug scurge."" You seem to be implying that you can ""deduce"" that I use drugs and that is the reason why I want them legalized; I resent that. These three things should have no bearing on the course of this debate. a) My handle is representative of the government's hypocrisy in banning a plant that no more than 70 years ago was vital to our efforts in WWII. Hemp, which farmers from all across the midwest have petitioned the government for their right to grow, has a great deal of industrial potential and my support of it says nothing of my usage of it's cousin, marijuana. b) My choice of presidential candidate is even less relevant to this ""discussion. I support Ron Paul because I believe in minimal government intervention; his stance on drug policy is only a small part of the reason why I support him. c) As for my choice of sources, I really don't understand. From what I can tell, the only direct source I posted was from swissinfo.com, which I found by googling Switzerland heroin addiction to see if your claim was correct, and I found that it certainly was not. ""By contrast, even though I drink alcohol, my only concern is for those who misuse drugs, thse who eventually will, and the rest of society who must endure the problems they create."" Your only concern is for those who misuse drugs? Well than you must think that all prescription drugs should be banned because some people misuse and abuse them. Do you see the flaw in your logic? Your problem is that you think the government needs to protect each and every one of its citizens from...themselves really, for they are the ones who choose to abuse drugs in the first place. Rather than setting an impossible task, the government should do its best to have an informed and educated populace that is capable of making the right decisions. ""The difference between attempting to ban alcohol and maintaining a ban on drugs is based on numbers."" True, that is the difference. But they are similar in the fact that banning them does very little to curb their usage. ""can you see my concern that drug dealers would be left with only children to sell to."" I can understand where you are coming from, but you fail to consider where the drugs are initially coming from. Of course, different drugs have different origins. First I'll consider the case of marijuana, and than heroin, as they will have very different regulations and they currently come from unrelated sources. Most of the marijuana in the country comes from large illegal growing operations, not individuals growing a few plants in their basements as many may think. If legalized, it is reasonable to think that the large operations would become legitimate and sell it only to adults or licensed retailers, for failure to comply would result in a penalty, which can be easily avoided without hurting their business. So where do the kids get it from? They have two options: know somebody who grows it themselves, or have a parent or older sibling buy it for them(the same as it is with alcohol). Now unless the number of kids growing it in their parents basement rises substantially, there will be substantially less marijuana in the school system. Heroin, on the other hand, is imported. It is produced in foreign countries like Thailand and Afghanistan, and it is smuggled into the country. If the primary business - the heroin addicts - are able to obtain their drug from the doctor, the demand is going to shrink significantly. A downward shift in the demand for a good causes a decrease in the price, in the short term. In the long term, suppliers either decrease their supply and the price reaches a new equilibrium, or they cut production altogether if the demand is not high enough to justify the risk. Either way, the amount of illegal heroin in the country drops. ""Additionally, any presently existing taboos that prevent the saner individuals from participaiing will disappear when children are told by their associates that ""...it is ok! Even the goverment says that it is."""" Not true, heroin addicts would be seen as sick individuals, and marijuana would be viewed much like alcohol. Some will refrain from using it, while others will indulge. What's important here is that only adults will be able to make the decision. So to recap, there are several reasons why drugs need to be legalized and regulated. 1) Society will benefit from less crimes related to the illegal drug trade. 2) The economy will benefit from a smaller black market, keeping more money in the legitimate sector. 3) The government will benefit from not losing money to an impossible War on Drugs, but instead possibly accruing a positive balance from taxes collected on the sale of drugs like marijuana. 4) Addiction rates will decrease when addicts are treated as sick people with a medical condition, rather than rebels who know better than the government. 5) Most importantly, the presence of illegal drugs in schools will greatly diminish, which will ultimately have the most profound effect on lowering future drug usage rates."

Those arguments should fall flat on the grounds that smoking is one of many forms of to benefit from weed's effects. Some alternative methods include edibles and pills. With more methods are being studied the smoking is bad argument becomes less important. There is also a common argument about it being addictive.

Saaec8cf8-A9efcbe5a	The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States.	"Okay, i will try to address all the points he makes, but as he did not roadmap them out as i did, i apologize if i miss one, and i hope the voters would not penalize me. My opponent says that my version of how cannabis was outlawed was not the case. If so, I'd appreciate his version of how it all went down, unless this is his version: ""There were in fact studies done to show how cannabis is dangerous."" If this is indeed his version, i suggest he look into the matter more. Perhaps read the links i provided, yes yes? I did paraphrase the whole matter, but it is essentially correct. Anyone interested should read those links and do some more research on there own. There was in fact very little to no research on the matter at the time of it's banning. But, as he also points out, research has been conducted that has shown that smoking marijuana is bad for you. The problem is, the research leaves out some important words and emphasis. It should probably read more like this: Research has been conducted concluding that SMOKING marijuana all day, every day, for years, is bad for you. Studies and research have been arranged by the government for years to show that marijuana is bad. They've also been carefully and conveniently edited to leave out the parts where it is beneficial, and not as bad as thought. Furthermore, your links and sources and that man's testimony all ignore the fact that smoking is not the only way (or most efficient way) to use marijuana. Vaporizers are the most efficient for using marijuana, and you avoid smoke. You can also ingest marijuana (or other THC products) by way of mouth, in brownies, baked goods, any recipe that uses butter, all sorts of things. There are many safer ways to use cannabis, the only reason smoking is so popular is it is more portable, and easier to hide. A vaporizer won't fit in your pocket, and generally baked goods don't belong in your pocket either. A pipe will easily fit in your pocket and is easily stashed in case of POLICE (AGGH!) Smoking is just easier to get away with as it takes less time and preparation. He says that weed smokers inhale more smoke for a longer time. They also smoke less, and less often. Next, he claims my argument is rash and not well thought out. Thanks. he points out that cannabis can relieve pain, obviously. He then ignores the rest of the benefits, but says that they can all be achieved by other medicines. This may be true, i'm not sure about all of them to be honest, but adding one more option, one more arrow in the quiver can't hurt. Some patients are allergic to one treatment or are otherwise unable to use that treatment, then another can step in. Diversifying the medicines and treatments for an illness does not hurt. Then he provides a link to testimony by a doctor during hearings when medical marijuana was considered in connecticut. First off, i would ask that if he expects me to reply to those points made (and the voters to vote on them), my opponent should make them. He simply provides a link to a doctor's opinion. The testimony provides little to no actual research or links to research, just the typical ""studies have shown"" phrases. If you want me to reply to the points, make them yourself and i would suggest bulk them up instead of have a doctor make them, because we can both find many doctors testimonies and opinions regarding the matter on both sides. What my side has that his does not is patient testimony. It works, it helps. And if you do get high by it too, who cares? Next, he claims that we would be harming the general populace by legalizing marijuana. I ask how so? We would not force marijuana on anyone. Marijuana is not a toxin. It is a plant with psychoactive and medicinal properties. Medicines have side effects, and so does cannabis. When considered carefully, cannabis used in ways other than smoking is much safer than many drugs on the market. Some would say even if smoked. You can't overdose on it. How many drugs on the market can you overdose on? Many! How many are potentially habit-forming? Many. Marijuana is not physically addicting. You may become psychologically addicted to it, but you may also become psychologically addicted to: sex, video games, eating, TV, and many other things. You may potentially become psychologically addicted to virtually anything. Marijuana is not physically addicting and has no potential for overdose, two worries that many legal drugs can bring (especially things like sleep-aids). We are not poisoning citizens for money by legalizing. Marijuana is not poison. Next he misunderstands or mischaracterizes my argument about safety. Cannabis will not be safer when legalized because citizens suddenly obey directions on the label. The point is not about controlled doses, an idea my opponent seems to have pulled out of thin air. It is about quality and purity. Let me explain. The better quality of cannabis (the more potent it is), the less a user has to inhale to get high. The less he uses, the less health risks he runs, especially if he chooses to smoke his weed. With legalization, yields and crops would gradually increase in quality until we had more of what stoners call ""headies"", which is just good weed. It is not common, but not unheard of to obtain a bag of laced marijuana. This means that the marijuana is laced with a more harmful or addictive drug. If the government regulated weed, there is no risk of getting laced weed. Safety would not increase because someone uses it the way the government says so, like my opponent says, that is ridiculous. It would increase because of quality and purity increases. Then he says government controlled doses are still unsafe (although he likes to use all caps for that). This is part of his misunderstanding of my argument. He asks you to look further into the detriments of cannabis. I fully encourage this, especially if you are considering using. But look at the benefits as well. Don't be afraid to ask why not, but don't be afraid to ask why either. Fully consider this decision. Next he writes (in all caps): MARIJUANA HURTS THE USER. PERIOD. First, (comma) I must protest the writing out of punctuation.(Period) It is unnecessary and frivolous. (Just kidding, I had to say that though). Marijuana indeed hurts the user. Tobacco hurts the user. Alcohol hurts the user. Many prescription drugs hurt the user. Food can hurt the ""user"". Many fun or tasty or exciting things in this world hurt the user. Moderation, responsible use, and education are the keys to wisely and safely enjoying any activity, especially drugs. Marijuana, especially if not smoked, hurts the user at such a minimal rate that it is not much of a concern (especially when contrasted with alcohol and tobacco). Next my opponent says that my attitude about the war on drugs is wrong, and un-American. He compares the War on Terror with the War on Drugs. He essentially says this: that no matter how futile a fight may be, we, as Americans, should continue the fight. Fighting against terrorists is fruitless i would agree, as is fighting against drugs. So why keep it up? The war on terror is a completely different subject that i don't want to talk about, but in my modest opinion, i think we should shore up our defenses and should have stayed the hell out of Iraq and Afghanistan. You can't win a war on terror and there is nothing honorable or right about occupying countries for years on end in search of a terrorist leader. If you want to take out a terrorist leader, use a smart-bomb, a black-ops team, whatever, but don't occupy a country for years. It doesn't work. The war on drugs (and in the context of this debate i mean the war on Pot) is fruitless, and fights not against an enemy wishing to annihilate us, but a plant, and personal freedom. Pot smoking doesn't hurt anyone but the user, and it doesn't hurt the user much either. I would comment more on this but i am running out of charac"	PRO	148
S4eb2076e-Ab0c8da48	We Should Legalize All Drugs	Thank you for accepting the debate. In response to the fact that you say a drug, such as marijuana, can be very harmful, I completely agree with you. I, myself, would never use these substances, but the thing is, it is the choice of the people to actually use these substances. The ones that do use the substances would provide the government with money, which we need desperately in a time of economic crisis. Additionally, I think that we also need to increase drug education in schools. If all drugs are legal, we need more education so the kids can make more decisions for themselves. There is also a medical aspect to this debate. The legalization of marijuana has cured thousands of people of cancer, and making it illegal would prevent these people from getting the proper medical treatment. Harder drugs like cocaine and heroin also serve as a great way to relieve pain, but they are slightly more addicting. Where cocaine is legal, in countries like Canada, dentists often put cocaine on their patient's gums to create a numbing sensation, easing the process of surgery for those who may be allergic to other numbing agents. Heroin also serves as a great painkiller for those who have gone through painful surgery or something of that nature. I know that abuse is a problem, but that is because doctors and drug companies try to make us buy more drugs to get us addicted and buy more. This can easily be fixed by banning all pharmacies and making them government owned. Finally, there are also hundreds of drugs that get people in trouble, but are actually not even bad for you. For example, ecstasy makes you see hallucinations. It's not even addicting, yet people are getting their lives ruined for only doing having a little bit and end up having to serve life in prison. The economy would see a great boost if all drugs were legal. Those who are addicted would give a lot of money to the government, reducing our taxes and making our country #1 in the world again.

Saaec8cf8-Af5dd6f7d	The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States.	"We've agreed to go again, even tho this will be the third time! Good luck! To clarify the resolution: simply, use of marijuana (both medicinal and recreational) be completely legalized in the US. Use of marijuana would thus no longer be against the law and would be allowed for adults over a certain age (Yet to be determined). My arguments: The use of marijuana has been prohibited and demonized by the federal government (as well as state governments) since about 1914. Many people assume that marijuana was outlawed in a very careful process that went something like this: Scientific proof of danger in use + Congress = Reasonable Law protecting constituents They assume that there were extensive studies, hearings by the government, as well as experts in the fields of Science and Medicine. In truth, none of this happened. Marijuana was outlawed for many reasons, few of them legitimate. Here are some of them: Racism Fear A young government officer looking to further his career Money and greed. Government officials actually thought (or at least told their constituents) that marijuana made Hispanic and African-American people go crazy, having fits of violence. Here's an actual quote: ""I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigarette can do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents. That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage of our population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons, most of who are low mentally, because of social and racial conditions."" Harry J. Aslinger, who was the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics, used marijuana as a scapegoat to further his career. I don't want to go that in depth into the prohibition of marijuana in the first round, but keep in mind that it was banned essentially because some white government officials didn't like Mexicans, African Americans, and (of all things) jazz music. http://legalizepot.wordpress.com... http://civilliberty.about.com... http://www.encod.org... http://www.drugtext.org... Now I'd like to point out benefits of marijuana and its legalization. First, marijuana has medical benefits. Marijuana and its active chemical, THC, have been shown to help patients suffering from glaucoma, eating disorders, nausea, loss of appetite due to AIDS or chemotherapy, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, and pain. Second, legalizing marijuana not only provides tax revenue, but decreases danger associated with its use. If marijuana was legalized and taxed similarly to alcohol and tobacco, it would create billions of dollars in revenue for state and federal government. This would be especially appreciated in our economy's current poor condition. Not only would it stimulate government revenue, but it would create jobs. Legalization would also allow for safer use of marijuana. If moved into the realm of legal commodities to be bought and sold, government could then regulate it (similar to alcohol, tobacco, or any food!). This means marijuana would be safer for users. This means you don't get bags of weed laced with more dangerous and addictive drugs like PCP. Furthermore this means that a user no longer has to associate with criminals. You would not have to go near a drug dealer who most likely deals with harder drugs, as well as other crimes, to get marijuana. You could get it in 7-11, or in a more regulated environment like dispensaries. Third, prohibition and the ""War on Drugs"" have not, and will not work. Millions, even billions of taxpayer dollars go to the war on drugs. Your money is spent to put small time users in jails and prisons, to prosecute people for a victimless crime. And for what? Marijuana is still the most common illicit drug in America. 40% of Americans have used it. The President of the United States used it! Millions use marijuana. Prohibition has not worked. If the government wants any control over use of cannabis, then it needs to legalize and regulate it. At least when it is regulated the government can keep an eye on things to maintain safety! In its current state of prohibition, as long as you can get the goods, anything goes! Those will be my points for now, I await with eagerness my opponent's arguments. And good luck to whomever that opponent may be!"	PRO	150
S8bb4c1ee-A609985a9	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	You stated that the illegalization of Cannabis was mainly based on culture and there is sufficient proof about your claim and also articles that support that statement. However don't you think that since 1937 they could've revised that law and probably legalized for those above the age of 18 just like alcohol or even cigarettes ? But NO they did not. Therefore we see that there is a purpose in why Marijuana is illegalized. You see unlike alcohol, if Marijuana was legalized it would lead to lead to long term cognitive effects and these are happen in people that use the drug before the age of 21. These effects include Short term memory and the diminishment of a capacity to learn or even recall information : With that we see that it is not good but beneficial to refrain from the recreational use of the drug. Just like any other drug like cocaine or heroine, cannabis has effects that last long after smoking(the feel good effect) unlike the smoking of cigarettes which calms someone down at that present moment. Do cigarettes impair your ability to drive? NOPE ! Cigarettes don't impair your ability to drive but cannabis does; It affects ones perception and psychomotor performance which can clearly lead to accidents on roads which puts not only the driver's life but also other people's safety at risk. You see once the drug is legalized then you can't keep an eye on everyone smoking because 1. its physically impossible and 2. there'll be such a high demand that a government won't be able to monitor users and especially where and when they use the drug. Studies are in your favour and suggest that young people are not delinquents because of Marijuana but instead abuse Marijuana because they are delinquents. Abuse by the way means ABNORMAL USE. So if we take a look at the young delinquents in most nations and consider the type of antisocial behavior that they engage in then we see that its best we don't legalize cannabis. In America there was a recorded 750 000 arrests due to Cannabis and these were mostly related to those who were in simple possession of the drug and the rest were crimes driven by the use of Cannabis. If we consider that frame of stats we might think that is we legalize the drug then its a case of many people getting jobs as sellers and growers but that's not the case. Once we do that then we are starting a reaction that will damage a country's future. With a legalization there'll be a high dependency on Cannabis whether its the use or simply growing and even selling, which means that : 1. Young people especially those of a specific race are not seeking after education at a higher level like varsity or PhDs but would rather enter the Cannabis. This leads to a nation that has a dull future and is forced to hire foreigners because it has a high demand for educated people of a certain skill set. 2. In a country like the US then its hazardous because there will be production of the plant nation wide but not a large market. If the market is so small then so are the profits. Concerning the health problems associated with cigarettes. Its all dependant on the smoker rather than the fact that its legal. Tobacco is the plant and once we illegalize the production of Tobacco then we have taken away the Farming business of thousands of farmers in nations all around leading to a high unemployment. Cannabis was illegalized for a reason and it has boundaries are the medical field and should stay that way .	PRO	151
S8c8c9887-Addee909f	All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use.	"I realize that I might not explained myself well enough. While I think all drugs should be legal, I still think there should be regulation. For example, only adults should be able to 1) It doesn't matter if you would allow thousands to kill themselves, the governments job is to protect its citizens (EA: police, Military, Fire department, ect.) You cannot claim its protecting its citizens if people are melting from drugs. Children are effected by their parents melting, and lots of times even innocent children are introduced into drugs by friends and family, not all of them go into it thinking, oh this will melt me. All of this is protecting people who weren't intentionally trying to die. They are protecting their right to happiness. Letting people kill themselves is part of the pursuit of happiness. (This seems to be turning into a debate about the right to kill yourself.) 2) Smoking and drinking are not nearly as addictive as morphine, morphine is also used medically, so people who are given medical morphine and become addicted will be fueled by recreational use. and remember even children are administered morphine in hospitals. So you are for legalizing MASS addiction and then feeding it. I wanted to legalize it, not making it so there won't be any regulation. Only adults would be allowed to buy drugs. Have you ever heard of people getting morphine in a hospital and becoming addicted? 3A) Children in situations worse than you are exposed to drugs more often than you, so those parents who die will expose their children who initially could have avoided it. The same parents could have got them from the black market. I think that increased regulation would mean that less people will die, even if drugs are easier to get. 3B) A funeral is more expensive than a life in prison or in every drug users case, a year or two. Who pays for the funeral? The individual. If they don't have money for a funeral, they don't have money for drugs. Perhaps make a law that people that die from suicide/intentionally harming don't get their funeral covered by the government/anyone that uses drugs for non medical use forfeits government paying for their funeral? As I said, regulations and laws will have to address this. 3C)no that's the point you're causing a continuous cycle of increased potency of addiction. If people have pure drugs, and can freely talk to their doctors, counselors, and other people who can help, won't that mean that they'll be less likely to be addicted to the point that it harms them then if they had to get their drugs on the black market, with no regulation ? 3D) there is a massive amount of harm, people dead, melting, ODing, broken families, Equal crime, all for a ""possible benefit.""

Saaec8cf8-A6e788908	The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States.	"Alright, lets get started. I will address what my opponent has said, while at the same time building my own case. Please note that as the affirmative, the burden of proof falls on my opponent. Lets begin. So my opponent starts out by saying that cannabis was only prohibited due to dislike of ""Mexicans, African Americans, and (of all things) jazz music."" Really? This is not the case. There were in fact studies done to show how cannabis is dangerous. Why is it still not legalized? Is it because we are STILL prejudice? While some radical groups are, the government is obliged to not be racist. If this were the only reason that marijuana is banned, then certainly it would not be banned anymore. Here is why marijuana is ACTUALLY banned. Smoking any drug is unhealthy. Cannabis is no exception. The smoke actually contains higher concentrations of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than tobacco smoke. Cannabis smokers generally inhale more smoke for longer depositing more than 4 times as much tar on their lungs as cigarette smokers. http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com... http://cyber.law.harvard.edu... http://www.marijuana-detox.com... So, I hope that cleared up why marijuana is ACTUALLY banned. Now to address his ""benefits."" He says that marijuana has medicinal benefits. This is rash and not completely thought out. Obviously, it can relieve some pain due to its numbing effects. However, there is a great cost to these benefits that can be achieved JUST AS WELL IF NOT BETTER by alternative medicines. Please read or at least skim this article by a MD Physician. It is very eye-opening. http://www.alexarends.com... This should have addressed the medicinal benefits. Now on to the revenue. He also says that it would provide revenue and increase the safety of the drug. I will address each. First, the fact that any industry brings revenue is obvious. Yes, money would be coming in. However, we would be harming the general populace by doing so. Do we really want to sell this toxin to our citizens? Should we actively be poisoning them just for money? I think not. In the same paragraph, he says that legalizing marijuana increases its safety. ""OK, so its legalized now. I am going to take it in ""safer"" doses now, right? I will obey all instructions on the side, right? I will do all of these things just because the government said so, right?"" Here is the thing: Obviously people disobeyed the government by getting illegal marijuana. Why would they all of a sudden obey the government, just because what they are doing now is legal? ""OK, well, I am going to smoke this the way the government says so."" What? Ya, because that worked so well before. Right. On top of all this, even government controlled doses ARE STILL UNSAFE. Please look even further into all of the detriments of cannabis. EVEN IN SMALL DOSES, MARIJUANA HURTS THE USER. PERIOD. Lastly, he says that prohibition didn't work, so neither will the war on drugs. While this is somewhat true, should we not try? Think about it this way. The war on terror will never be won, so lets not try. What? OK, the terrorists slam a plane into our buildings. Oh well, we can never beat them. Is that the kind of thinking we should be taking as Americans? Absolutely not. We need to take a proactive stance to let the population know that THIS IS WRONG. I would like to now pose a question for my opponent. Why should marijuana be legalized for adults, but not children? (Assuming it were to be legalized) In attacking my opponent's case, I hope you saw the structure of my own case. Marijuana is harmful, and has no medicinal benefits that cannot be achieved by safer options. (If my opponent contends this, I will post several proven medications) Because of these reasons I can only oppose the resolution. Thank you. The use of cannabis by adults should be legalized in the United States. Negated."	CON	153

S9fa39f2d-Ad9016847	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Immoral Yes, it is a personal belief, but I also have a personal belief that triangles have three sides. Just because it is a personal belief does not make untrue. When you said the ""world is not so black and white that Kant's moral belief system should be absolute for everyone."" You didn't give a reason for this that the world isn't black & white. Further, you state that ""In the case of the terminally ill pain is useless because there is nothing one can do to save their life. Therefore Kant's moral belief system becomes irrelevant."", but Kant's reasoning didn't depend on whether or not there was a possibility of survival. Also, there is nothing that is impossible just highly improbable, so there is not a single person that is without hope. ""If animals are allowed that humanity then why not us?"" We separate ourselves from animals in many ways. We have a Universal Declaration of Human rights but not animal rights. Humans are separate from animals because we are capable of higher thinking, and realizing that we exist. Further, you assume I am in favor of euthanizing animals. 2. Subjectivity It doesn't matter what the source of the pain is, it still makes you act differently, and you don't dispute that. Further, you say that since illness is natural is valid, but pain from torture is invalid since it is not natural. That is the appeal to nature logical fallacy. [5] 3. Right to Die They also had her parents' words which were the other party in the case. Non-voluntary euthanasia is the proper term. [1] Also, you have never shown there was a right, and the supreme court unanimously agreed there was no right. [2] 4. Slippery Slope It isn't an opinion, it is a trend shown by the countries that have legal euthanasia, and in fact just recently Belgium, one of 4 countries that have euthanasia, now allows euthanasia of children. [3] ""...to suggest that infants would start being euthanized without probable cause is highly unlikely..."" Probable cause? You are saying if there is a probable cause then we can euthanize infants, and you still say that the slippery slope is my opinion? Also, the Netherlands thinks they have probable cause too. 5. Voluntary Yes, the Nazi plan wasn't voluntary, I wasn't saying it was. I agree that it targeted the ill and disabled, and what demographic does this ""voluntary"" euthanasia target? It is the same group of people. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, Euthanasia suffers from a high amount of complications from failure to induce coma, a longer time than expected for death, etc. [4] Also, a BBC report 1 in 5 cases of euthanasia are not ""easy"". [5] ""There is no Nazi party here trying to find legal methods of exterminating people."" This wasn't the point I was making. In fact you avoided everything in this point. Everything in this argument was to show that it isn't voluntary as you think, that there is coercion, and guilt that factor into such ""choices"". 6. Pain Relief You NEVER addressed this point. 7. Terri Schiavo It wasn't euthanasia in the way you used it, but it was Non-Voluntary euthanasia. "" She had made the choice to die..."" That is not true. As stated in the last round ""There are no written declarations by Terri Schiavo as to her intention with regard to the issue"". There was no choice made by her. If there was a choice, there would not have been a court case. 8. Gallup Poll Euthanasia isn't a unique situation, I showed many other things that would go into the same category of only involving the persons opting for it. ""By your phrasing the people over 60 would have no say in the matter."" I am not sure how you came to that conclusion, I am sure they were part of the people opposed. The point was that public opinion has no validity on what should and should not be law. If you are in favor of euthanasia, gay marriage, and marijuana for the reason that it only affects those involved, then you should be in favor of the other things I named such as public nudity, beastiality, or polygamy for the same reason. "" It's not forcing anything on the nation as a whole."" Yes, it does that was the subject of points 4 & 5. The majority don't decide laws here. See video. http://www.youtube.com... The government protects people from themselves all the time with seat belt and helmet laws. ""euthanasia is the choice of an individual."" Like I said you didn't argue point 5 about if it is or not. I made the case, and gave evidence for that it isn't, you made a statement that it is. 9. Logical Fallacies I didn't use appeal to authority because I never said that something like ""Well [unqualified person] doesn't think that euthanasia should be illegal too."" About the Slippery Slope, I never said that euthanasia is genocide. I said that euthanasia lead down the same path as mass murder. I showed how the two are similar and how slowly countries are moving in that direction. It would have been a logical fallacy if I didn't provide proof. It seems you dropped you case that this is the appeal to nature. Refusing a medical treatment is not ignoring pain since they can still get different medical treatment that is aimed at relieving pain. If someone jumps off a skyscraper, that is suicide because it is ending their life sooner than it naturally would have, but refusing medical treatment is not suicide because it is not ending their life sooner than it naturally would have.

Now, You might argue that they can't stop smoking, But my question is, Why did they start smoking them in the first place? I still don't get that. Why would you want lung cancer as a part of your life? Cigarettes should be banned because of this. Second, Marijuana. Niggers love to smoke it and get high everyday. It's so god damn annoying. It's already illegal in the first place, So why make it legal now? Also, No, We shouldn't have medical marijuana, Because the black people are just going to abuse the system so they can get high like the niggers they are. Third, Meth. Yeah, Screw that. Meth f#cks people up. 'Nuff said. I could go ON AND ON AND ON about how bad drugs are. Basically, Drugs are bad, And only disabled honkeys, Niggers, And other races smoke.

Both my opponent and I posted many sources explaining why marijuana was banned. No matter which you believe, it matters not.

This takes us back to my previous analogy that you misunderstood. Perhaps it was my fault: we can always reduce crimes by making previously criminal behavior legal. So your argument would therefore justify legalizing rape. 2) ""The economy will benefit from a smaller black market, keeping more money in the legitimate sector."" The black market will redouble efforts to sell to children. There is nothing in what you or R. P. propose that can undo the reality that the profit motive of the drug cartels will persist. 3) ""The government will benefit from not losing money to an impossible War on Drugs, but instead possibly accruing a positive balance from taxes collected on the sale of drugs like marijuana."" The war can be won, but not with the half hearted mesures of the past. Taxing marijuana will increase its cost, which undermines your contention of undercutting the black market. 4) ""Addiction rates will decrease when addicts are treated as sick people with a medical condition, rather than rebels who know better than the government."" You pointed to Switzerland as your example of how this would work. That country has about 30,000 heroin addicts in a population of approx. 10 million. Extrapolating to the U.S. population, that would be about 900,000 heroin addicts. Not exactly something to be proud of. 5) ""Most importantly, the presence of illegal drugs in schools will greatly diminish, which will ultimately have the most profound effect on lowering future drug usage rates."" There is absolutly no factual evidence that this would happen. The laws of economics suggest that it would be the exact opposite. When markets erode, organizations will adapt by finding new methods or by creating new markets. Either way, targeting children will be expanded. Thanks for a really great debate.

S9fa39f2d-A30224149	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Freedom and dictatorships are not opposites. Freedom and totalitarianism are, and democracy and dictatorship are. You can have a totalitarian democracy or a freedom protecting dictatorship. You say I used the False cause logical fallacy but it don't see that I said any false causation. I said pain makes you do things you would not normally do, and torture is was just an example of how pain will change what people do. I did not commit that logical fallacy. I could prove it just by stating that many nations still use torture to ""change"" peoples minds' and if pain didn't do this then nobody would use torture. 1. never ending or changing First, the human body is always changing and nothing about it is never ending or changing including pain. The statement about people suffering from depression is to show that most are suffering from that mental disorder, and not in the right mind to make such big decisions. Yes, people are suffering, but suffering can be relived as previously stated. I never stated that depression caused their suffering or illness, I just people with the suffering usually have depression and are not in their right judgement. 2. Being hooked up to a machine is what keeps many people alive such as Terri Schiavo. In Terri Schiavo case was not euthanasia, she should have never been hooked up to a machine in the first place if was against her will. ""As far as a child being able to make the choice to end their life, that is another debate altogether though that would be a very tricky topic."" Children don't have the ability to make such decisions which is why we don't let them do many other things like smoking, driving, buying a house. Gallup poll Then inter-racial marriage would have been banned for much longer, and so would segregation, slavery, laws that teach creationism. Just because something is popular doesn't make it right. Hopefully, you like the death penalty because that is popular, just like being pro-life. If tomorrow a poll revealed that 80% of people agreed that citizens over 60 should be euthanized to reduce medical cost would that be something we should make law? After all it is the people's will. Marijuana is legal in four states? Really please name them since I only know of two. [3] 3. The belief of the majority has been overlooked because it wasn't right like ending slavery. We are a republic not a democracy there are certain things that no matter how many people favor can not be done like ending the freedom of press. Further, democracies have done terrible things at the majority whim like executing Socrates. [1] Also, there is plenty of negatives which is why it is legal for states to forbid such actions. ""'What gives us the right to deny them what they so desperately want?' Again we are not talking about something malicious such as murder"" Why not murder? If they desperately want it why not? You gave no reason on why not. ""Policies change all the time such as those pertaining to marijuana."" So, what does this prove? ""True we do impede on the choices of others on certain topics but euthanasia is a unique problem that cannot be compared to the wide variety of subjects you mentioned. If you like I could go into depth on each of these subjects to show why they have no relevance."" Yes, I would like that because there is no reason why they are not in the same category. ""Your logical fallacy was an appeal to authority since there are laws prohibiting your examples."" Really, is this a joke? Appeal to authority: ""You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true."" [2] I never said the law forbids, so it must continue to be forbidden. That is an appeal to authority. You falsely claimed another logical fallacy. As for the slippery slope, this is also false. First, this is only a fallacy if ""no proof is presented"" [4], and I drew direct correlations such as targeting elderly, the disabled, the sick. Now to the appeal to nature. This is yet another false claim. I said ""Refusing medical treatment isn't suicide, they are not ending there life any sooner than would naturally"", which is just telling why refusing medical treatment isn't suicide. There is no claim that this is good or bad or preferred. I was just stating a fact, so to claim I said ""Con contends that euthanasia is ending a life sooner than it would naturally so therefore it is not right or justifiable."" If, this were true I would have never advocated for palliative care since it would extend a persons life beyond natural means. 3. Right to Die Terri Schiavo' s case is a interesting one. ""There are no written declarations by Terri Schiavo as to her intention with regard to the issue"" [5] The issue of life support. Her case was between her husband and her parents who believed she had opposite stance on this issue.

S8c165140-Ab2bb8b81	All drugs should be legalised, change my mind.	I do not want free health care, but I do want the people doing drugs to be offered psychological help. But free health care is another discussion. Driving while on drugs should be illegal. Just as it is today. But all your arguments seem to be standing on one belief: If we legalise heroin, everybody is going to use heroin! Well, how many people reading this would start using heroin if it were legal? I bet nobody would start using it just because it would be legal. Nobody think like this: oh I cant take care of myself, and I don't want to use drugs, so I need the governments laws to take care of me! Nobody see the law as an obstacle for drugs, you either want to do drugs, or you don't. There is nowhere in between. Simple as that. My point is that there wont be a large amount of people who start doing drugs just because it will become legal, and that is what your arguments seem to be based upon. 1 in 3 adults have been doing illegal drugs at some point in their lives. I don't think that anybody would think that 1 in 3 adults have been suffering from all those negative aspects of drugs that you just mentioned. Which means that you are taking a bunch of exceptional and extremely rare cases, in order to prove that all cases of drugs are bad. There is a really big and important difference of guns and drugs. If the rate of drug use goes up and down, there that wont be a big problem, since it is only hurting the drug users themselves (actually, a very small proportion of the drug users). But if the rate of gun violence goes up, we have got a really big problem at our hands. Guns are made to harm other people, while drugs are made either for medical reasons, or for an experience. A man has his own choice if he would like to do drugs or not, but no man has a choice if he will be shot by a gun or not. The legalisation of drugs would in my opinion stop the development of new, less expensive and potentially more dangerous drugs. Take cocaine for example. The main reason that cocaine got as popular as it did, was because of the high marijuana prices. If the marijuana price would have been lower, cocaine would have never been popular. That brings the question, why were the marijuana price so high? The answer to that question is that it were illegal. If marijuana would have been legal, the price would have been low thanks to competition. But since it were illegal, it got harder to sell, so the drug dealers could set a higher price. By then, the demand for a new, less expensive, and potentially more dangerous drug also went up. So my point is, the more money we put into the war on drugs, the harder it get for the drug dealers, forcing the price to go up and forcing a faster development of new, cheap, and more powerful drugs. This is the reason for so called internet drugs today. If the price would be low, nobody would develop new drugs, because there is no demand for it. I hold it to be the inalienable right of anybody to go to hell in his or her own way.	PRO	161

Sa799c6ee-A5f67a685	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	"If the war on drugs is unwinnable, I fail to see what the end game for this war might be. Simply making the drug industry illegal and incarcerating recreational users and addicts along with producers and dealers IS giving up the battle. Since drugs and drug users cannot be eliminated altogether, the challenge is to reduce the harm that drugs can cause on users, on addicts, and on society. Prohibition makes the drug problem worse, not better. ""[Legalization] would result in legalized unlimited sales of all types of currently illegal drugs. This would allow drug dealers to operate freely, able to coerce more people into buying drugs and becoming drug addicts. They would be free to sell anything they like and would likely increase sales of the most dangerous types of drugs due to the larger profit margin and the absence of serious prosecution."" This is why legalization of drugs needs to be coupled with regulation of the drug industry. Regulations on the production and distribution of drugs takes control of the industry out of the hands of the cartels, gangs, and street dealers. During the period of America's failed attempt at alcohol prohibition, production and distribution of alcohol became the domain of the criminal underworld. Producing, selling, and buying alcohol became as dangerous an endeavor as producing, selling, and buying cocaine and heroin is today, where these products are illegal and unregulated. It is precisely BECAUSE of the health risks that many drugs pose that the industry needs to be regulated. Most people, modern ""libertarians"" aside, understand the need for regulations on the production and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs because of the added risk to the public if these products and industries were unregulated. The use of any drug, whether currently legal or illegal, carries with it inherent risks. Prohibition adds to these risks, as evidenced by America's alcohol prohibition. ""The removal of restrictions on drug use would lead to many people to believe taking drugs is OK. Many people who would never have tried drugs either because they were scared of the danger posed by drugs or the fear of persecution for using drugs would take drugs."" Alcohol and tobacco have largely been legal and readily available in most places for as long as most of us can remember. This does not mean that people grow up being told that unchecked use of these drugs is ""OK."" People are educated about the risks that these drugs pose. Society has rules about who can use and purchase these drugs, who can sell them, what you are prohibited from doing while using them, and where you can use them. Drugs that are currently illegal should be subject to the same level of factual education and restriction. I say ""factual"" education because much of what is being taught as drug education is unneeded and counterproductive fear mongering. People do not need to fear the effects of drug use, they need to be taught the actual risks that drug use poses. In many areas, children are still being taught the erroneous view that marijuana use is a ""gateway"" to the use of harder drugs. They are taught that marijuana soon loses its effectiveness, and that users are driven to harder drugs to achieve their highs. Once people realize that what they have been told about marijuana use is untrue, they may question whether what they have been told about other drugs is also untrue. Facts, not fear, is what is needed. Fear of prosecution is also counterproductive when it comes to people seeking treatment for addiction. With few exceptions, alcoholics do not need to fear incarceration and/or loss of employment when they come forward seeking treatment for their addiction. Because alcohol use does not face the same social stigma as does the use of illicit drugs, society is more tolerant, accepting, and helpful to addicts looking to kick their alcohol addiction than it is to those with other chemical addictions. ""The legalization of drugs would also make them much cheaper to buy."" This may be true of some drugs and in some areas. As anyone who requires prescription drugs knows, legality does not always equal affordability. Lower drug prices actually has an upside for society at large. Addicts do not rob and steal because of the effects of the drugs, they do so precisely because of the high, unregulated drug prices. Lower prices means lower crime rates associated with addiction. ""These factors combined would lead to an increased burden for both the police force and the health service, and will allow gang and mafia culture to thrive."" Ending the war on drugs and drug users would significantly reduce the burden on the police force and the criminal justice system. Legitimizing and regulating the drug industry eliminates the need to prosecute and incarcerate producers and distributors. The production and distribution of drugs would be held to the same standards as is the production and distribution of other potentially dangerous products. Legalization and regulation would also stem the flood of recreational users and addicts into the prison system. The resources could then be used to increase funding for rehabilitation programs which are actually effective at combating addiction, unlike prison. Addiction is a medical issue and should be treated as a medical issue, not a criminal issue.

I agree, I do not want people to do drugs, but i dont think that drugs have to be a bad thing. Most people can handle their life while doing drugs. About one in 3 adults do drugs in their lifetime. I would not think that you believe that 1 in 3 adults have ruined their lives. So that means that you are taking an exeptional case in order to make all cases illegal. I believe that the people who are suffering from an addiction should be offered help, and medical treatment. You said that poor and mostly depressed people would use drugs to get way from reality. I would agree on that, but you are missing the problem itself. The problem itself is not that they are doing drugs. The problem is that they are poor or depressed from the beginning, the drug is only a consequence from poverty and depression. People usually say: If we legalise heroin, everybody is going to use heroin! Well? how many reading this would start using heroin if it were legal? I bet nobody would start using it just because it would be legal. Nobody think like this: oh I cant take care of myself, and I don't want to use drugs, so I need the governments laws to take care of me! Nobody see the law as an obstacle for drugs, you either want to do drugs, or you don't. Simple as that. The legalisation of drugs would in my opinion stop the development of new, less expensive and potentially more dangerous drugs. Take cocaine for example. The main reason that cocaine got as popular as it did, was because of the high marijuana prices. If the marijuana price would have been lower, cocaine would never have got as popular as it did. That brings the question, why were the marijuana price so high? The answer to that question is that it were illegal. If marijuana would have been legal, the price would have been low thanks to competition. But since it were illegal, it got harder to sell, so the drug dealers could set a higher price. By then, the demand for a new, less expensive drug also went up. So my point is, the more money we put into the war on drugs, the harder it gets for the drug dealers, forcing the price to go up and forcing a faster development of new, and more powerful drugs. This is the reason for so called Internet drugs today. If the price would be low, nobody would develop new drugs, because there is no demand for it. This is why the war on drugs is failing, people will still get drugs even if it is illegal. But if it were legal, some of them would actually seek help to cure their addiction. If its illegal, then instead of help, we put them in prisons, where there is a higher rate of drugs and criminality then there are out in the real world. I have a question for you. Does drugs use HAVE to be a bad thing? I know that I would never in my life use any drugs, but if some people can find their happiness in it, who am I to judge? “You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.”	PRO	164
S4291ec8-A240e3d55	The legalization of Marijuana is likely to have a more favorable impact than current policy	First off I would like to thank my opponent for not only starting this debate but for not taking advantage of a bad situation. First I will analyze your argument. 1.How would lower street prices help? That means people will still go for the more dangerous version on the streets because it's cheaper dealers would not decrease they would increase. It's just like a bootleg DVD the quality may not be as good but it's cheaper. 2.We supposedly regulate alcohol and give stiff punishment to those who give alcohol to minors but it doesn't seem to be stopping minors from getting it how would this be any different? 3.Marijuana is just as much a harmful drug as all the others. A drug that affects your dopamine levels so that you're always content on how things are no matter how bad things are or how sick you are seems pretty dangerous to me. (I'll get into the deeper effects later.) 4.There is no such thing as a safe environment when it comes to weed. If you get hooked it's over and if you have legal access to if you might as well give up your house and family now because if you're always happy and content you won't care about going to work, you won't care about what's going on in the family and you won't care about life because you'll be to busy being happy. 5.I'm skipping your fifth argument the ban is perfect but I don't feel like elaborating. 6.Who's going to do the regulation and taxes when there all high. 7. One although weed is illegal for use it has not hampered studies of this and other now banned drugs for future pharmaceutical use, and two the only thing this drug can be used for in medicine is for pain relief and should still be used only in the worst of the worst situations. 8.There are lots of different options out there that aren't pharmaceutical all of the little herbs, spices, and snake oils which have been proven to work and aren't illegal. And even though the drugs you have listed do have their problems so does weed. I mean at least those don't make you think the sky is purple down is up and that signs are staring at you. 9.That is an over exaggeration most prescription medicine is not shared with the family partially because of the cost and partially because with medicine what makes one better makes another sick that's just how it works for the most part the only things that are shared are weak painkillers and allergy medicine. 10.Yes it would free up 60,000 jail cells but fill many more hospital beds and graves because even though it's almost impossible to overdose the weed can still hurt you and others indirectly for example: •Any person with a touch of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder would wig out whether they smoked the weed or inhaled the second hand smoke because of their chemical imbalance and the dopamine inducing effect of the drug. And since some of them are violent this could end badly for them and those around them and don't for get about all the other mental disorders that go undiagnosed and untreated. •It get's rid of stress and though that may sound good think about it what keeps you going? Being relaxed without a care in the world, No STRESS DOES!! If we lost all stress nothing would get done and that includes the things needed to keep the house and feed yourself you cold starve your self to death and never know. That is dangerous probably the most dangerous side effect there is. •Lack of judgment can lead to accidents in the workplace, at home, and on the streets and highways and some will be deadly. Marijuana is a horrible drug all it does is warp the reality off the user and hides the real world from them if we legalize this drug kiss what remains of the U.S.A goodbye we don't know the meaning of restraint so making marijuana legal is like inviting anyone who wants to destroy us to come on because we're defenseless and if they don't get us our lack of will to work will crash our economy.

S8bb4c1ee-Aafed72f2	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	Thank you for accepting the challenge, you have put forward many strong points. I realise that the laws regarding Marijuana hasn't changed yet (in the UK, I don't know much about other countries) however I think that is not because this scenario (cannabis illegal, cigarettes legal) is the optimum one but changing it would be difficult. Legalising cannabis would anger many people who have seen the negative effects it causes (which there are) and make it seem as if the government is supporting this. Meanwhile making cigarettes illegal would anger people who feel they have the right to choose etc. There is little incentive for a government to change the ruling, that doesn't, however, mean it shouldn't be changed. I also do not deny that Marijuana has negative effects, sometimes serious ones, but I do not think that they in any way compare to the far larger number of deaths due to cigarettes as shown in my statistics from the first round. The long term effects of cigarettes are far greater and more dangerous than that of cannabis, especially for those around the smoker. If Marijuana were to be legalised, I agree it would have to be strongly controlled by the government (as is the case with cigarettes mostly). This means controlling production and taxing imports heavily. But the government would be far more able to control such things with cannabis legal rather than illegal and it could be done in such a way to greatly reduce (if not eliminate) the effects you describe. Also, it may be the smokers not the fact that it is legal causing the health problems, but that doesn't change the fact that those health problems would decrease were it to be illegal. As well as this, I choose to value the lives of thousands of people over the farming business of thousands of farmers. As far as I see it, there are 4 options: Both illegal, neither illegal, cannabis legal and cigarettes illegal, and cannabis illegal and cigarettes legal. The first two of which are justifiable either by considering our freedom to choose or by thinking that any substance which causes such harm should be illegal. The latter two are far more difficult to justify, partly because cannabis and cigarettes are very similar, however the last (which is the subject of the debate) is extremely unjustifiable given the immense damage that smoking does in comparison to cannabis. I therefore challenge the Pro to argue for this option over the other three and not just explain the consequence of changing the legality. Again, thank you for accepting the debate, I look forward your response.	CON	167

S8c8c9887-Ae8e81d0c	All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use.	"So its cool you came up with arguments for me but that's not the route im going, your resolution clearly states ""All drugs"" That means every single drug should be able to be used for ""recreational use"", so instead of bringing up issues with legalization, I will bring up specific drugs that are not legal now for recreational use, and should never be. And since you as AFF hold the Burden of Proof, you must prove ""All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use."" if even one drug shouldn't be legalized then you haven't proven ALL DRUGS, thus you cannot win. 1) Desomorphene (Krokodil) Desomorphene is a drug composed of Codeine, gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous from matchstick heads, it provides a high that masks pain. However it has extremely drastic results; it rots the skin off your body while you are alive and awake. Forbes reports ""What makes this drug so exceptionally strange, however, is that once injected it begins eating the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body from the inside out, causing blood vessels to burst and surrounding tissue to die. Essentially a corrosive acid with opiate effects, krokodil destroys body tissue the way battery acid eats through plastic, opening large sores that can go all the way to the bone.""[http://www.forbes.com...] (I went to get photos and nearly threw up; DO NOT GOOGLE KROKODIL) 2) Morphine We all know what morphine is, its highly addictive and very effective. but legalizing it for recreational use is a terrible idea, recent studies show that morphine, when used regularly, will actualy degrade your bones. That means taking morphine can lead to bone loss, severe pain, and in time death. the national library of medicine conducted a series of experiments and reported that morphine ""accelerated sarcoma-induced bone destruction and doubled the incidence of spontaneous fracture in a dose- and naloxone-sensitive manner. Morphine increased osteoclast activity and upregulated IL-1Ã""Â² within the femurs of sarcoma-treated mice suggesting enhancement of sarcoma-induced osteolysis. These results indicate that sustained morphine increases pain, osteolysis, bone loss, and spontaneous fracture, as well as markers of neuronal damage in DRG cells and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines"" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...] 3. Now I will address your points. A.) Leglizing drugs leads to a more widely used product, while individuals may have gotten high at parties, they generally do not provide their own drug. that means legalization will provide them with the way to get their hands on it, if we allow ALL DRUGS to become widely assessable for recreational purposes our death rate increases. B.) We wont be spending it helping them if we have to spend it burying them because their flesh rotted away. C.) When you allow a low quality drug to be mass produced drugs even stronger, more dangerous, and addictive appear on the black market. D.) There is 0% chance that someone abiding below the law would suddenly decide to follow the law. The mafia is a prime example, they were created when alcohol was banned and they still exist, killing just as many as ever. E.)look at D. F.)The reason why drug initiatives exist is because they are illegal, when meth and acid were legal in the 80's schools didn't fight them. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I see that youre new so let me give you some tips for next time: 1) Be careful how you phrase your resolution 2) dont form arguements for your opponent, you should state your own arguements. 3) if you want to refute the opponents views you should go neg, then have them go first and skip thier last turn. 4) dont get worked up over anything, DDO has alot of trolls."

S776ec737-A15ad5208	Random drug testing should not be used in public schools.	"Resolution Clarification: I'm talking about random drug testing only of students who participate in extracurricular activities. (i.e. You have to pass random drug tests to play basketball, etc.). Conditions/""Be Nice To Me's"": This is a three-round debate. You may introduce new arguments in the first and second round, but I ask that my opponent refrain from doing so in the third round, as i will not be able to respond. In the third round i ask that my opponent only present rebuttals, etc to arguments presented earlier in the debate. I will do the same. Me Talking: About 40% of teens use marijuana. According to the Monitoring the Future study, 70% of high school students used alcohol in the last thirty days. Supporters of drug testing claim that it deters and/or catches drug users and protects children. But does it really deter drug use? A 2003 study conducted by the University of Michigan, drug testing had very little to no impact on drug use in high school students. Schools that tested their students and schools that did not had virtually the same rates of use. In fact, for whatever reason, it found that 12th graders were MORE likely to use marijuana at schools that test! I affirm the above resolution; for the following reasons: 1. Drug tests are ineffective. 2. Random drug testing violates constitutional rights and principles. 1. Drug Tests are Ineffective. Urine tests conducted by labs are only accurate 46.5% of the time according to Dr. Kent Holtorf. How are we supposed to rely on a rate so low? We can't count that a positive is a positive or that a negative is a negative! ""Passive use"" (essentially secondhand cannabis smoke) has caused false positives in urinalysis and hair follicle tests. As well, foods, medicines, and medical conditions can cause a false positive. Common cold medicines containing ephedrine can show up as amphetamines, poppy seeds as heroin, ginseng tea and higher doses of ibuprofen as marijuana. Diseases like diabetes cause chemicals in the body to be produced that can show a false positive for opiates, cocaine, and barbiturates. These tests (especially urine) are easy to beat if you know how (and there are plenty of websites dedicated to telling you how). There are essentially three ways to beat a urinalysis: Adulteration: mixing in another substance in your pee to dilute or mask signs of drug use. Household products can be used as well as commercially available ones. Substitution: Using someone else's pee. It could be a friend's or commercially available clean pee. Dilution: Drink enough liquids or other options to push the amounts of chemicals in urine that show drug use. You can simply drink a lot of water to dilute your pee, and take a B-vitamin to make it yellow again (because labs reject clear samples). These test also only test for certain drugs. Other drugs are impossible to detect. This means students can simply switch to another, potentially more harmful drug. Marijuana, relatively harmless, may stay in your system for up to a month. Alcohol, LSD, Ecstasy, and mushrooms are out of your system within hours or days of use, or just plain undetectable. Tests are also just too plain expensive to be using, especially being so susceptible to tampering and mistakes. Urinalysis costs about $20-60 for each test. More thorough tests cost upwards of $120. As well, NCAA drug testing standards require a second, backup test in case of a positive. Many high schools skip this second test because of the cost. This only increases the possibility of a false positive. 2. Random drug testing violates constitutional rights and principles. These tests violate constitutional principles, the first i will focus on being the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"". Drug tests require you to prove your innocence, reversing the process to ""guilty until proven innocent."" This is an unacceptable practice. Next, testing violates the 4th Amendment (rights against searches and seizures). The key to this amendment is determining what searches are reasonable. This means that for a search to happen, you need probable cause, a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. Random drug testing is by nature unreasonable. There has been no reason to suspect the student is using drugs. If there were reasonable suspicion, a drug test would be in line. However, the RANDOM factor means we're testing students without any suspicion. What if the government decided to submit citizens to random house searches for drugs? It's unconstitutional without probable cause/a warrant. Since a test constitutes a search, this is unconstitutional. Testing violates a student's right to privacy. Besides the act of asking already self-conscious teens to pee in a cup with a witness outside the stall or right next to them, there are more violations of privacy. As mentioned, certain medicines and conditions can cause a false positive. This forces students to disclose medical information to the school to be checked against the sample. This is a blatant invasion of a student's privacy. The tests also reveal more than just illicit drug use, they can reveal medical conditions, pregnancies, all sorts of things that schools do not have the right to demand. Testing violates the right to due process. There is no way to appeal a decision to remove a student from a team as a result of a drug test (or any other punishment). Student's have no way of appeal and no opportunity to defend themselves. In terms of due process, to test a student and then punish him/her for a positive is akin to a police officer searching your house or car without cause, then arresting and sentencing you without the right to appeal or defend yourself. The last constitutional right that testing violates is found in the 5th amendment: the right to remain silent. It essentially states that no one should be forced to be a witness against himself. Providing a urine, hair, or blood sample is basically being a witness against one's self. It is forced self incrimination. I eagerly await my opponent's opening arguments and wish him/her good luck!"

S6c2b1862-A914894db	Recreational cannabis should be illegal.	"I would like to refute and touch upon a few of your statements if I may. You begin your first argument by saying- ""Yes, cannabis can cause mental deficiencies among some parts of the population. This if the person has been regularly abusing marijuana since childhood, or to those who have a specific variant of the AKT 1 gene."" Then you sum up your first argument by saying- ""So if your genes aren't retarded, you are okay. You can smoke weed if you aren't a weird mutant."" Cannabis will negatively affect people with underlying mental disorders, which is a surprisingly high percentage of the population. As well as people who smoke while in their teenage years, because it's a critical time for their brain development. it also affects people with the AK 1 gene. According to recent estimates, approximately 20 percent of Americans, or about one in five people over the age of 18, suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year. This means the total number of Americans who will suffer mental disorders from smoking cannabis, such as depression, anxiety and psychosis are very high. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... -Source showing how many Americans have underlying mental disorders. Knowing that 1 in 5 Americans could develop a form of mental disorder due to their underlying condition and cannabis, could we really justify legalising it? I fail to see any positive effects on mental health. Legalising cannabis will make it easily accessible to children and teenagers. They could steal it from their parents or ask a stranger to buy some for them, in exchange for half the amount ( I used to do this with cigarettes. When I was under age) Knowing that cannabis has a major impact on the development of teenage brains, we simply can not risk having an epidemic of anxiety and depression, amongst other mental disorders caused by cannabis. I would ask my opponent to provide mental benefits for cannabis, as that's what I've failed to find. You state- ""Also Canada has legalized pot and there is nothing wrong with them and everyone likes them. Be like Canada my friend."" Canada has not legalised cannabis recreationally. Canada have only legalised it medically. however, the medical benefits of cannabis are still in question and if such benefits do exist, they have not been fully recognised by science. Instead many medical professionals claim the ""benefits"" are just a placebo effect. Some scientists say it has medical benefits on pain relief, nausea and headaches. Why then, do doctors not offer you a vape full of cannabis? Because all research seems to vary from person to person, indicating a placebo affect. Despite this, I have no problem with cannabis being used for medical purposes, as it's a great way to research the drug. Certain groups in Canada hope to push for full legalisation by spring 2017, but this will violate many global treaties, so I'm doubtful that will even happen. My point is simply- Canada has not legalised recreational use. http://www.cbc.ca... -Source showing that Canada has not legalised recreation use of cannabis. Conclusion. Cannabis is a hallucinogenic, which means it's a psychoactive agent which can cause hallucinations, perceptual anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness. The common types of hallucinogens are psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. I don't think children should have easy access to a hallucinogenic and I don't think we should risk many people developing anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, psychosis and many more mental disorders, simply because some people want to push for legalisation and then get high and lounge about all day playing video games. We can not control the strains of cannabis, they will keep getting more potent as the demand for a better high grows.

By my opponents rationale pain from some illness is one of our bodies methods of protection so therefore it is a natural phenomenon whereas pain induced from torture is not a natural pain, it is caused by the intentions of another person. Therefore it is irrelevant. My opponent seems to be in a fairy tale where reality simply does not exist. He seems to believe that people do not live in perpetual pain for the rest of their short lives. True we cannot determine exactly how much longer they will live but that is one of the greatest benefits of medicine and science today, we can observe and record people with conditions and predict rather accurately the outcome of those with the same illness. So you contend that depression is widespread but what if a person in perpetual pain had never had signs of depression until the pain began? Yes sometimes pain can be relieved but you simply cannot deny that sometimes every option available still does not work. Sometimes there is no relief medicine can offer. That is a fact of life 2. I never stated that it was euthanasia I stated that she was essentially allowed to commit suicide because she did not wish to be kept alive by machines. She had made the choice to die rather than live by machines, much like a person suffering perpetually opts for euthanasia. As I said in the previous round children and euthanasia would be an entirely different debate. Gallup poll Again euthanasia is a unique situation, it only involves the person opting for it. If a physician did not wish to participate in euthanasia that would be there right to refuse such as some refuse to do abortions. There would be those that would participate in it. ""If tomorrow a poll revealed that 80% of people agreed that citizens over 60 should be euthanized to reduce medical cost"" This was an incorrect use of the word euthanized as it is a choice. By your phrasing the people over 60 would have no say in the matter. 3. More and more states are legalizing things that were once taboo such as gay marriage or marijuana. The views of the individual are beginning to gain more weight as we've seen in recent years. The fact remains that euthanasia is a personal choice. It's not forcing anything on the nation as a whole. It was overlooked because the power of law lies with the few and they did not uphold their duties and respect the voice of the people. It is not their job to protect people from themselves (please cite a source if you disagree) and no where in law does it state that if they disagree with the masses that they have the right to act against our decision and yet they do anyhow. Murder is taking away a persons choice, euthanasia is the choice of an individual. Vast difference It shows that the taboo is loosing its impact. People are beginning to break down the walls of myths that surround subjects that were once taboo and they're finding that it was not as horrible as they were made to believe. Gay marriage, marijuana, things like that. People have lived in ignorance on these subjects but the more they actually educate themselves on the issue the more their views have changed. Like the gallop poll on euthanasia for example or marijuana. Two decades ago these were still taboo subjects, especially gay marriage and now the military even allows it to some degree. ""In 2010, two federal courts ruled the ban on openly gay service personnel unconstitutional and on July 6, 2011, a federal appeals court suspended the DADT policy.[1] In December 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and under its provisions restrictions on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual personnel ended as of September 20, 2011."" http://en.wikipedia.org...

""Slippery slope"" Must I define euthanasia and genocide for you? gen""o""cide /G2;jenəG6;sīd/ noun noun: genocide; plural noun: genocides 1. the deliberate killing of a large group of people, esp. those of a particular ethnic group or nation eu""tha""na""sia /G6;yoV2;oTHəG2;nāZHə/ noun noun: euthanasia 1. the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma. The practice is illegal in most countries My opponent seems to have trouble understanding the difference of the two so I shall attempt to break it down. The Nazis operated under the guise of a euthanasia program that had already existed but the methods used to do so were illegal but at this point they had complete control of the government therefore rendering anyone virtually powerless to stop them. My opponent refuses to admit his proven fallacies despite being caught red handed. The Nazis operated under a dictatorship under a man named Adolf Hitler who attempted the Jewish Genocide. America does not operate under a dictatorship, this is a country where the president is elected by the people and we have elected officials that represent us. Are you suggesting that America could be converted to a dictatorship which would make your scenario plausible? Nazi Germany is the only country to attempt using ""euthanasia"" as a means to commit mass murder. ""any sooner than would naturally"" naturally being the key word in the phrase. This correlates to your statement in round one. Refusing medical treatment is ignoring the ""pain"" meant to keep us alive and therefore immoral by your standards as the person is choosing to allow their life to end. If someone dies by jumping off a skyscraper is it suicide? Yes, if someone refuses medical treatment that would save their life is it a form of suicide? Yes, they are choosing death plain and simple. The person chose to not save their life which is immoral by your stance. From round 1 ""1. Immoral One of the most famous philosophers of ethics was Immanuel Kant. He came up with a system of figuring out if an action was moral or not called the Categorical imperative. The Categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire. In using the this method Kant condemned all forms of suicide by saying the purpose pain is to protect one""s life [1] , such as taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one""s life was contradictory to the purpose of pain and was therefore immoral. We usually strive to be moral beings, so we should avoid from having immoral acts."" 3. Right to Die Unfortunately she did not leave a declaration as to her intentions on the issue so the husbands word was all they had to go by. ""non-voluntary euthanasia"" again you have misused the word. Euthanasia is physician assisted suicide, Terri was removed from all forms of life support allowing her to starve to death. According to your previous rounds she died naturally as no one euthanized her. She starved to death."	PRO	183
S4eb2076e-Af97e2a36	We Should Legalize All Drugs	"I'd like to start off by saying I don't support prohibition of any kind, however I will attempt to debate from a pro-prohibition mindset. **NOTHING I SAY IN THIS REPRESENTS MY ACTUAL VIEWS** Marijuana is currently legal in 7 states within the United States of America, and the US's citizens have been pushing for the legalization of marijuana. Many people believe marijuana to be a wonder-drug, with few negative effects, however this is not true. Marijuana can cause hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis when taken in high doses. As well as impaired memory even in low doses. Marijuana also affects brain development. When people begin using marijuana as teenagers, the drug may impair thinking, memory, and learning functions and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions. Researchers are still studying how long marijuana's effects last and whether some changes may be permanent. For example, a study from New Zealand conducted in part by researchers at Duke University showed that people who started smoking marijuana heavily in their teens and had an ongoing marijuana use disorder lost an average of 8 IQ points between ages 13 and 38. Those who are depended on heroin, and other opiates are disproportionately involved in criminal activity. Here is an excerpt from an article from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... titled ""Insights into the link between drug use and criminality: Lifetime offending of criminally-active opiate users"" ""We test whether the offending trajectory of those who test positive for opiates is greater than test-negative controls and whether the relationship is constant both prior to, and post, opiate initiation. We consider whether these relationships differ according to gender and offence type. The study provides an analysis of historical offending records in adults linked to test results for opiate and cocaine metabolites. Those testing positive for opiates were linked to treatment records to retrieve data on age of opiate initiation. Rate ratios (RR) were calculated to compare opiate positive testers to opiate and cocaine negative controls, separately by gender and adjusting for age and birth cohort. Age of opiate initiation was included in a second model as a time-dependent variable. Within-subject clustering was accounted for using generalized estimating equations. Opiate-positive cases had higher rates of offending than test-negative controls, both prior to, and post, opiate initiation. Initiation of opiate use increased the RR by 16% for males but doubled it for females. The RR increase in non-serious acquisitive crime was greater than that seen in serious crime. For males only, opiate initiation narrowed the difference in violent offending rate between cases and controls. A larger offending increase was associated with opiate initiation in female, compared to male, users. For most crime categories, the difference between groups is exacerbated by opiate initiation. The findings indicate that opiate prevention initiatives might be effective in reducing offending, particularly among females."" It is clear that these substances cause crime, and can be quite dangerous.

S8c8c9887-A134e2905	All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use.	1) Desomorphene (Krokodil) From what I understand, this drug makes you high, then kills you. I'm for the right of people to kill themselves. There are many people who kill themselves painfully without any protection from pain (like a high) at all. I don't think this is worse than that. Therefore, I think this drug, and any other drug that kills you, shouldn't be illegal just because it kills you. 2) Morphine Basically, what you're saying is that morphine should not be legalized for recreational use because it causes long term, irreversible damage to your health and eventually kills you, right? I don't see why people shouldn't be allowed to slowly ill themselves. How is that any different from smoking or drinking? 3. Addressing my points. A.) Only people that want to die, or at least don't REALLY care, will die directly from that. If someone feels so bad, why not let them kill themselves like that? There aren't enough jobs or resources. Letting people that want to die, die, isn't a bad thing. Taking away people's rights is. B.)Money will be spent cleaning up after them once instead of continuously while they're in prison. C.) This just seems like more options to me. I don't understand why this is necessarily a bad thing. Legal stores would be able to sell the new, stronger drugs just as much as the black market. D.)But this would be one less thing for them to do illegally. And there is a chance. Again, no harm, possible benefit. E.)Smoking and drinking are legal, but there are still lots of initiatives against them in school. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About your tips: 1) I'll try to be careful how I phrase my resolution. 2) I looked at some other debates before this one, and they just happened to all be like that so I thought that's what I should do. :) 3) I'm not exactly sure what this means, but thanks for the advice. 4) I won't.

S8c8c9887-Ab197a1e8	All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use.	"1) The regulations would, of course, make it so that it would be illegal for adults to introduce minors to drugs. One possible way for this to happen would be only allowing people to use drugs in certain areas or buildings where one must present ID, or some other form of identification to show that they are not minors. Kind of like bars, except that would be the only place where the drugs could be used. Your idea of the pursuit of happiness has no relevance in this discussion. Analgesic action: this merely means pain relief. I don't see why this is something that should be considered a deterrent for drug legalization. Higher toxicity: I have already argued that people should have the right to kill themselves. A less toxic drug is just as bad as a more toxic drug, depending on how much of it one takes. Since it's already possible to abuse currently legal drugs, this won't really matter. Respiratory effects: As long as people know what they are getting themselves into and don't hurt anyone else, they should be allowed to do what they want. For the same reasons smoking and alcohol are legal, all drugs should be legal. General depression: ""Depressants are substances which slow down the normal function of the central nervous system."" ""Depressants are commonly used to reduce anxiety, induce sleep and lower inhibitions."" This has nothing to do with the major depressive disorder, commonly known as depression, which you seem to have confused it with. ""So they aren't PURSUING HAPPINESS...and CAUSING DEPRESSION..."" Gastrointestinal motility: 2) No, I'm not saying that minors don't ever drink, smoke, or chew tobacco. I addressed this when I replied to statement 1; ""...people could only use drugs in certain areas or buildings..."". 3A)""...none of the nightmare scenarios touted by preenactment decriminalization opponents , from rampant increases in drug usage among the young to the transformation of Lisbon into a haven for ""drug tourists"" has occurred."" ""Although post-decriminalization usage rates have remained roughly the same or even decreased slightly when compared with other EU states, drug-related pathologies "" such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage "" have decreased dramatically. Drug policy experts attribute those positive trends to the enhanced ability of the Portuguese government to offer treatment programs to its citizens, enhancements made possible, for numerous reasons, by decriminalization."" ""The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success. Within this success lie self-evident lessons that should guide drug policy debates around the world."" http://www.cato.org... This directly refutes your assertation, which you have provided no evidence to back up. 3B) 1. A funeral is more expensive than regulated drugs, so people can go broke buying drugs. That depends on how expansive the drugs are, and how often they use those drugs. Anyways, the same argument can be applied to junk food. It's cheaper than a funeral, and eating enough of it can eventually make you need a funeral. However, it would be ridiculous to ban junk food because of that. It's your choice. 2. That means that the government pays 7 to 10 thousand dollars, and since deaths are higher we pay millions. ""If you keep it simple, though, the average cost of a cremation, including a basic memorial service, runs about $1,600. If you go for a so-called direct cremation, without a memorial service, the cost can drop well below $1,000. Go online and you can find prices as low as $600 or so."" http://www.nbcnews.com... You provided no data on how much the government pays for funerals, only how much a normal funeral costs, so I had to look this up myself. The government could probably get bulk discounts too. You used the high end of the price range, which is completely unrepresentative of what the government would have to pay. 3C) We have cigarettes now and people die, do they have the ability to talk to doctors, counselors, and other people who can help? Yes. But they still suffer and die. ""Evidence from controlled field experiments suggests that antitobaccomass media campaigns conducted in conjunction with school- or community-based programming can be effective in curbing smoking initiation in youth and promoting smoking cessation in adults."" http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov... 3D) 1. As I stated above, children are exposed to these drugs. Is it OK that their lives are being risked? It would be illegal to sell any drug to anyone under the designated age, perhaps 18. Anyone caught doing so would lose their license to sell drugs, and with it a sizable slice of their business; they might go to prison. It would not be worth the risk. 2. Overdosing has nothing to do with purity, it has to do with the amount we intake... If you don't know what you're taking, you are more likely to kill yourself accidentally. 3. ...and setting it up for recreational use means NO DOSAGES, it's use at your own risk. Everyone would be free to overdose if they want. They would just know exactly how much they could take for whatever their purposes are. They would know exactly what the side-effects could be, and how much they need for a high. 4. While crime may go down ... So you admit that crime would go down. This would save HUGE amounts of people from dying! 5. ...we spend more and more on deaths... Here is some evidence that points in another direction. ""Evidence from Portugal, where all drugs were decriminalized over 10 years ago, suggests safer behavior (fewer fatal overdoses and cases of HIV), when the law is not breathing down your neck so heavily."" http://newint.org... This, and the end of all the violence associated with the illegal drug trade, shows that there would be probably less deaths. 6. ...and families may break over prisons or death, The thing is, there would be less deaths as well as less people going to prison, so that argument is invalid. 7. HOWEVER there will be an influx of death. See 5. 8. That means more deaths than prisoners, which leads to more broken families. See 5. 3E) I don't know what world you're from, but drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes are used by teens. ""40 per cent of 12 to 13-year-olds "" and that rose to ""60 per cent among 14 to 15-year-olds"", that doesn't sound like a decrease that's working. 1.If your programs were working why is there an increase as children get older? ""...teen drug and alcohol use take a turn for the worse... ""We are troubled, but not completely surprised, by these numbers because, in schools and communities across the country, support for drug education and prevention programs has been cut drastically due to budgetary pressures.""

S8712369-A6b33bc8a	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	Thankyou lannan13, let’s get right into it! The loss of a life of a loved one, or house-hold pet can be very grievous and hard for people. Let’s face it, no one wants to lose someone close to them. When you have an extended period of warm memories with that person or animal, it becomes increasingly harder to let that life go. However my goal in this debate will be to prove that sometimes Euthanasia is the best option. There are two types of Euthanasia that my opponent and I talked about in a private message prior to this debate. Those two options being voluntary, and Non-Voluntary. My take on voluntary, would be that the patient in question is willing and wants to die by their own choice. Non-voluntary to me means the patient is not willing to die, and that ending life support is not their choice and goes against their own will. I’ll be arguing on the pro side of both of these sides. My only exception on Non-Voluntary would be if the patient didn’t want to die, and the person paying the medical bills was willing to continue paying for life support. According to the definition I provided in round one, I am going to be arguing for Euthanasia only in the case of patients who are under life threatening illnesses that are incurable, and will not be focusing this debate on under age suicidal teenagers. Argument 1: Resource delegation Research data shows that most medical costs go into patients last month of living. If a patient were even to be Euthanized a month before the time their predicted time of death, the saving are enormous. “Assuming that (1) 2.7 percent of patients who die each year (62,000 Americans) would choose physician-assisted suicide, (2) these patients would forgo an average of four weeks of life, and (3) the medical costs in the last month of life for each patient who dies are $10,118 (in 1995 dollars), we estimate that legalizing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would save approximately $627 million in 1995 dollars Estimated Cost Savings from the Use of Physician-Assisted Suicide by Patients with Cancer Who Receive Conventional Care (in 1995 Dollars).). This amount is less than 0.07 percent of total U.S. health care expenditures. “(1) For a patient or a patient’s family who is willing to end life support of their own will, not only does it save them a lot of money, but it also saves these resources (medical resources) for individuals who aren’t life threatened. Non legalized Euthanasia is flushing money and medical equipment down the toilet so a patient can suffer longer against his or her own wishes in many cases. When we are weighing the value of life, we also have to weigh what value that life can continue to bring other than a family members happiness, as opposed to the value of what could be saved if the person were to take part in assisted suicide. Argument 2: Quality over Quantity Suffering and pain is the worst possible place to be in. No one likes to willingly suffer, and more often than not, most would choose death over the idea that their suffering will never end. Why should every individual not have the opportunity to cease their own life as their own choice? Or if the person isn’t able to make that choice, have someone else end their suffering? Value in life has desisted at a certain point, elderly individuals often have experienced much of life. And if it is a child in such circumstances, why would anyone be okay watching a child go through so pain? So the question here is, what is more important, the quality of one’s life, or the quantity, the proverbial number of days the person has lived? If pain and suffering is all a person has in their cards for the remainder of their days, then we should legalize the ability to end that so as not to ruin their overall quality of life even further. Argument 3: It is possible to regulate Euthanasia. Euthanasia if legalized wouldn’t be omni-present tool used all the time, and without good reason. Just as every rule or legislation, it would be modified to make sure individuals still followed the correct protocols in order to proceed with Euthanasia. Legalization of Euthanasia doesn’t mean doctors will run around willy nilly, distributing lethal doses to their patients against the will of the patient or the client. In fact Oregon is one of many states that have legalized Euthanasia through their “Death with Dignity act” and it is heavily regulated to satisfy societal moral compasses, and patient wishes. In order for a patient to receive such treatment, they must go through a series of avenues, questionnaires, and meet strict requirements in order to be eligible for Euthanasia. More information on their specific laws can be found on the Q and A page. (2) My point is that each state that legalizes Euthanasia will have a specific set of rules that must be followed in order for it not to be a crime, just as with Colorado’s Marijuana legalization. Argument 4: Euthanasia already happens To take more of a Utilitarianistic approach (or a consequentialists if you will), death is inescapable. Passive Euthanasia will occur, due to lack of funding to pay medical bills, or the equipment simply failing to work on a patient in many cases. Many patients will die anyways, and when they do it will be much more painful than it needs to, and much more expensive. Why let Passive Euthanasia kick in, wasting an individual’s quality of life, money, and all to let them suffer? Conclusion: Is death really such a bad thing? It may be impossible to know. For many it is fear of the unknown, ignorance if you will, of what is beyond the black void we call death. We will all make our way their however, and many of us would prefer to get there the easiest, and most painless route possible. That is my proposal, that life is beautiful, and that to preserve such a beautiful thing in misery is wasteful, and archaic. We as humans have evolved to a point where Euthanasia is the most logical, humane, and resource effective avenue, with really little to no recourse. Thanks again lannan for the debate, and good luck in your follow up round. Sources: 1. http://www.nejm.org... 2. https://public.health.oregon.gov...	PRO	193

That increase of 154% shows that almost all women who undergo abortion commit suicide.

There is just a 14% chance of him getting it, as is for all the other living people in the world.

S8c8c9887-A5837a7d1	All drugs should be legalized for both medical and recreational use.	"This is my first debate, so I apologize in advance if I accidentally break any rules. :) I am NOT arguing that people should not be discouraged from using drugs. 1.Drug use is a victimless crime; people should be allowed to put what they want in their bodies. 2.Legalizing drugs would save people from going to prison. 3.Legalizing drugs would make it so that people can buy high quality drugs, and have the proper dosages so they don't hurt themselves as much. 4.The money from legalizing drugs, and from not wasting it on stopping people from getting drugs, could be used for more important things. 5.If drugs are legal it becomes easier to get funding for research on them, which may eventually lead to drugs without negative side effects. (1)http://www.policechiefmagazine.org... (This link also has some ideas for con, which I'm going to try to address now.) 1.The legalization of drugs would increase use, lead to more experimentation by youth, and exacerbate the existing deleterious effects that drugs have on society. The thing is, people that are bad enough to need drugs can already access alcohol and cigarettes. Many currently illegal drugs are less harmful, and might even work as replacements, which could easily outweigh the negative effects of the few that might start on the ""hard"" drugs. 2.They are of the opinion that government subsidization of addicts would have crippling effects on the economy. But now that money would be going to help the drug users, instead of sending them to prison. 3.They also feel that legalization would help to create a large black market for drugs. There already IS a large black market for drugs. If a legal source became available, why would people go to the risk of getting drugs from an illegal source? 4.Drug dealers and hardcore addicts would not suddenly become productive, law-abiding members of society. Dealers will still be involved in crime and violence and that users will still need to support themselves by engaging in criminal activity. If the drug dealers lose their customers, there is a possibility that they'll just give up on illegal work on become productive members of society. If not, they just find some other illegal work. No gain, but no loss either. The users will buy their drugs from legal sources or they'll stay with the illegal source. Possible gain, no possible loss. Also, if drugs become legal, it will be easier to find rehab and they might become productive. 5.Basically, they believe that the legalization of drugs would lead to increases, not reductions, in crime because there would be more addicts and because of the aforementioned black market. I've already addressed the concerns of the possible black market, so I'll focus on more addicts. First of all, if all drugs become legal, people will know exactly what's in their drugs and the proper dosages, so they'll be less likely to become hooked. Also, since people could freely talk about their drug use, they could find better ways to deal with their addiction. Especially since people could help them completely give it up. 6.Statistics show that drug prevention initiatives, drug awareness curricula in schools, and drug treatment programs are working. They point to the fact that there are fewer addicts today than there were 20 years ago. And that is wonderful! And legalizing drugs will have no effect on those programs. Actually, more money could be spent on those programs after it stops being wasted on sending people to prison."	PRO	196
Sc351e266-A5e89da73	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"Alright, thanks to Con for an intriguing case, and I'll launch into it. Just a note at the top: I did alter the sourcing from that debate, removing and adding several, as well as altering the order. Please use the sources as I've presented them in the previous round, and not the ones in that link. Con's arguments break down to three key points: that the federal government doesn't have this authority, that prostitutes are victimized by dangers inherent to the system, and that legalization does not solve for those dangers. R1) States Rights Multiple responses. 1) Let's be clear that the resolution says ""should"" and not ""could."" Con is arguing that there's an inherent barrier that prevents the federal government from engaging in this action. That doesn't matter. The question was posed as a ""should"" in order to explore the outcome of the federal government taking this action. Con cannot simply argue that there are impediments, otherwise we'd never get to the basic question of the debate. He has to show why the federal government circumventing those impediments is actually harmful. He hasn't presented any such harms, merely asserting that the tenth amendment is a barrier and we shouldn't pass it. He'll need to do more than that to win on this point. In fact, I would argue that having the federal government act invites beneficial discussion, as it results in nationwide engagement in the discussion of both prostitution and the duties of the federal government. That discussion, both by the populous at large and the Supreme Court justices, would provide a much needed examination of an issue that has been stuck in the past for far too long, as well as updating views on the limits of federal policy and duties of the federal government for the better. 2) The tenth amendment is incredibly vague. It doesn't afford any specific powers to the states, it only says that ""powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."" On that basis, why should we assume that states should have this power? Why shouldn't the power of choice go to the people, allowing each individual to make the choice? Pro doesn't provide any reasoning, he just says that the tenth amendment wills it to be so. That's not enough to dismiss my case as impossible. 3) The vagueness of the tenth amendment has led to numerous abridgments of it, most notably regarding interstate commerce. Congress has actually passed constitutional laws criminalizing prostitution from this perspective,[26] so they have intervened in the prostitution issue before, and as that law is still on the books, they continue to play an important role. There's no reason why that role cannot be reasonably expanded. In fact, it has been before: ""federal power has extended into many areas of the economy... The commerce clause has been interpreted to authorize many laws whose real purpose was not truly to regulate commerce between the states but for which it was possible to point out some way in which the effect of the law would or could affect commerce. For example, the Supreme Court struck down California's attempt to legalize marijuana for medical uses and upheld the federal government""s right to outlaw marijuana nationally (even though the California law affected marijuana that would be cultivated and consumed in California and therefore would not directly be part of interstate commerce). The logic was that legalizing marijuana in one state would effect the national market for marijuana and therefore federal preemption of a state's right to decide what drugs are legal within that state was permissible as a regulation of interstate commerce."" This shows evidence of how such a law would be regarded by the current USSC, and therefore how a tenth amendment challenge would be ineffective. Moreover, since the tenth amendment has only presented as a successful challenge to new federal laws twice in the last 78 years, and since those cases required that the federal government actually ""commandeer"" state legislature for its own purposes (something my case is not doing), it seems unlikely that this would be ruled as unconstitutional.[27] 5) Even if you buy that a challenge might be successful, international law would still supersede it. Cross-apply my advantage 2. The basic justice that I talk about there outstrips any potential harms in this disadvantage. The U.S. population would view it as atrocious if states were to randomly eliminate jobs and thus stymie the capacity of their constituents to earn a wage. There is no difference here. R2) Prostitution creates victims and is dangerous All of these harms are ameliorated under a system where prostitution is legal. I've presented evidence that shows this. A. Disease Con's only support for this point is that HIV is common among prostitutes. I agree, it is common, but it's far more common in states like New Jersey than it is in Nevada. Look to my sources [8-12]. They show that disease reduction isn't just a likelihood - it's a certainty. The U.S. system has led to substantial reductions in the incidence of STDs. That's not to mention that, since my policy requires the usage of contraception, it prevents the spread of any STDs that do persist. If disease is the major concern, though, then there are plenty of other jobs that should also be eliminated based on this same concern, such as nursing staff, coal miners, and just workers in general. [28-30] If likelihood of acquiring an illness is the standard by which we determine if an occupation should be legal, then why aren't these other positions put under the same lens? B. Psychological I did address this to some degree in my R2, pointing out that psychological problems accompany the prison sentences that these women get in a system where prostitution is illegal.[6] I would argue that the physical violence they face, as well as the prison experiences, account for the vast majority of the mental concerns, and since both are substantially lessened in the absence of laws against prostitution, it's a big deal. But generally, Con will have to offer more proof than he's given here that prostitution inherently causes these problems. Can prostitution, as a profession, be blamed for past sexual abuse? Can prostitution be blamed for those women who don't have the disposition required for the profession? And, even if it can, is this reason enough to keep the profession banned? It's been well-documented that numerous jobs cause PTSD as a result of various traumas.[31-33]. Is Con suggesting that these should be banned as well? C/D. Mortality and Violence Again, I agree that morality and violence are common among prostitutes. However, it is far more common under a system where it is illegal. Look to my sources [1, 2, 4, 5, and 10-16]. They all provide evidence that a) locations where prostitution is illegal have high incidences of these problems (especially rape), and b) that locations where prostitution is legal have reduced incidences. But again, going back to the basic question, is this reason enough to keep this profession banned in many states? Con hasn't done any work to prove this. There are many other risky professions that are allowed in status quo, and for which we would find a ban to be abhorrent. An example would be a worker on an oil rig, where explosions, fires, fatigue, heavy machinery, bad weather and choppy seas put many of these workers at great risk.[34] Extensive studies have been done detailing these harms, which include many mental illnesses.[35] Oil rigs are male dominated, and despite safety improvements, continue to be a great source of physical risk.[36] Why should oil rig workers be allowed, whereas prostitution should remain illegal? This is going back to my point on justice, which showcases the harms of making such arbitrary delineations. R3) Legalization doesn't solve Con really doesn't put much time into this. He doesn't address my case, instead posting 3 paragraphs that fail to prove anything of note from a fact sheet that provides little more than the outline of a case against prostitution, drawing only limited evidence from two papers that Con himself doesn't cite, neither of which do research to compare countries where prostitution is illegal with countries where it is legal. Again, cross-apply my second advantage, which showcases how keeping prostitution illegal is inherently dehumanizing. The document Con's provided here merely asserts that legal prostitution is dehumanizing without warrants or evidence. He'll have to show that traffickers operate behind the scenes in U.S. brothels, something that I've already argued against in R2 and supported with my source [7]. Having the capacity to report trafficking also does a great deal to prevent this, none of which is at all likely in the status quo.[4, 5, 37] The only evidence that he provides here is is with regards to rape, physical assault, PTSD, all of which I've already responded to. The only point I haven't addressed yet is this argument that ""the routine abuse and violence that form the prostitution experience and brutally victimize those caught in its netherworld, and I would argue that keeping prostitution illegal keeps these women confined to that netherworld. Keeping prostitution illegal allows for numerous criminal enterprises to exploit women and further their own agendas, making for the worst possible outcomes. Con is allowing a terrible system to perpetuate itself, while I seek to solve for many of the harms, something my policy will most certainly accomplish.

S776ec737-A7a7df986	Random drug testing should not be used in public schools.	"In schools that randomly tested students, 12th-graders were more likely to smoke marijuana. But, and pay close attention because this what makes the stud(y)(ies) laughable: These results could just as easily been read as: In schools where 12th-graders were more likely to smoke marijuana, the students were more likely to be (randomly) drug tested. This is hardly surprising and makes the whole study questionable. Who commissioned it anyway? The White House. Why? ""It"" was displeased with the results of the earlier study which just happens to be the other study cited. Why? The earlier study did not address ""random"" drug testing. It just addressed drug testing. Non-random drug testing would have to be either the testing of everyone, or the selective testing of some based on some criteria other than random. This is even worse than random. So the study, even if everything else said about it is true, is completely worthless. All government studies are. All studies are government studies. Not to mention who paid for it. And remember ""peer reviewed journal?"" This is not that either. It wouldn't mean much even if it did prove anything which it does not. The two studies, if they were done properly which they were not, would be an elaborate comparison of the effectiveness of random vs. non-random drug testing. The latter presumably being the testing of everyone. So my opponent is presenting not very good evidence that drug testing either should or should not be random, we can't really tell which because the studies were so poorly controlled. How did they determine student drug use? Let me guess. There are plenty of sociological studies on teen drug use. This is not one of them. This is a charade. What could be more hilarious than Joyce Nalepka's grandchildren and the World Trade Center and all that Islamic hashish. http://tv.mpp.org... http://www.debate.org... No don't read that boring debate. Here http://www.AGrowthIndustry.info... light one up and watch a movie while I head on down to the library to go after this Dr. Keith guy.

S8bb4c1ee-A247dac53	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	"Why the scenario in question is correct is simply because of the right to choice. Upon coming t a consensus that it would be very difficult to change the current legal situation of both Marijuana and Cigarettes then we should also agree that the current situation is justifiable because : 1.There has been more warning and information about Cigarettes than there was In the last decade. Its astounding in fact. So the harm that's caused is not because of its legal state but because humans have a choice. If a person decides to stab himself and cause himself great harm and even death should we illegalize Knives because they can cause harm to people or should we take it into consideration that people have a choice as to how they use a knife. Same concept applies to anything hazardous. 2. For those who suffer due to being in close proximity I think in France there are places where people can smoke, a place where they don't potentially harm those who don't. In the Arab Emirates there are places where people can effectively smoke or drink without inconveniencing those who don't . To conclude I will talk about Cannabis just like Con did about its effects and why its legal state is justified in relation to Cigarettes. First off I will like state that in recent years there has been a drastic improvement with Cigarette production and the introduction of E-Cigarettes which are a good way to have Nicotine in the body and that helps reduce the amount of people affected by second hand smoking. My conclusion: The recreational use of Cannabis brings about not only one effect but leads to an unfolding chain of effects that don't affect a person in a large way like cancer developments but instead smaller effects that amount to something rather big. 1. You see unlike Cigarettes, if cannabis is used at a young age it literally takes over and decides who a person becomes. If youth use Cannabis not only are they in danger of experiencing a great deal of psychological damage but also they become very vulnerable to the abuse of much stronger and eccentric drugs like Molly and Heroine and Cocaine which have damaged lives and broken apart families to bits. If we look at the displaced people in society that wander around looking coins to survive are usually Crack addicts or heroine addicts who started off by smoking a ""joint"" for fun. People have dropped out of school. This was a good argument and I'm not sure where people stand but I believe its justifiable that the state of legality of both Cigarettes should stay as it is as well as for Cannabis. Why? The damage has been done but, there have been different ideas that can reduce the amount of people that are dying and not only are they ideas but ones that have been put into practice. People are dying not because Cigarettes kill but they chose to smoke."	PRO	199
S8bb4c1ee-Ac2f96157	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	"Hello, this is my first debate and I am looking forward to it. The topic is, 'Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal'. (I'll use 'smoking' to refer to smoking tobacco based cigarettes and cannabis to refer to the drug when used for recreational purposes not medical etc.) I disagree with this motion however I am not saying that both should be legal, neither of them legal etc, only that it should not be as described in the title. My first 2 arguments are as follows. 1) Cigarette smoking is more dangerous than cannabis. In America it is estimated that more than 480,000 deaths annually are caused by smoking (1) in addition to 42,000 deaths to secondary smokers. That is a large number of deaths which could be prevented. In fact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said, ""Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature disease and death in the United States.""(2) I could go into great depths about the statistics of lung cancer, heart disease and the cost to tax payers in the UK (I am from the UK where cannabis is illegal, so will apply most of my points to the UK), but the fundamental fact is cannabis, even where legal, causes far fewer deaths than cigarettes. It is therefore counter-intuitive that cannabis is the one which should be illegal. 2) Why is the line drawn here? It is not too hard to draw the line between legal and illegal at either end, all harmful substances legal or none legal. Drawing it between cigarettes and cannabis, however, is much harder (even assuming cannabis is more dangerous) as they are ultimately very similar and it is mainly culture which has decided their legality, not their objective level of danger. These are my first two points, I can introduce more in a later round when 'pro' has put forward their own points and rebutted these two. Thanks.

S9fa39f2d-A948c5f1c	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"""How is there no option?"" Taking away someones choice is not freedom, that speaks more of a dictatorship. 1. This is a logical fallacy, you presume that pain will cause people to do things they would not normally do. Torture is a completely different set of circumstances that do not coincide with the concept of euthanasia. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... A more accurate statement would have been ""pain might make people do things they would not normally do"" There is no way to prove your statement, it is simply an opinion. Though it has some truth to it because someone living in perpetual pain with no cure seeking out euthanasia would not be seeking it out if they did not live in perpetual pain. per""pet""u""al /pərG2;peCHoV2;oəl/ adjective adjective: perpetual 1. never ending or changing That is the definition of perpetual and it's how terminally ill people live out the remainder of their lives. By your own statement ""a super majority of older people suffering from terminal illness who attempt suicide suffer from depression."" 1. They are suffering 2. They are terminally ill These two things can directly cause depression, it is not the depression that is the cause of their suffering, or their illness, nor their pain. When a person has no quality of life they are going to be depressed. 2. Being hooked up to a machine is what keeps many people alive such as Terri Schiavo. As far as a child being able to make the choice to end their life, that is another debate altogether though that would be a very tricky topic. I apologize if my statement about ""forcing"" one's view has offended you, that was not my intention though when people try to take away a persons choice to do with their body as they see fit based on their own moral perspective that is exactly what's happening. It's not easy to think of someone suffering so much that they would rather end their life than continue living but that is reality. It's easy to tell others how they have to live when we are not that ones suffering. Gallup poll ""popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity"" Popularity of an idea is the view of the people whom these laws would affect so it absolutely has validity. For example: The presidential candidate to receive the most votes will become president because that is the choice of the people. Marijuana is another prime example, legalization has become a very popular idea over the last decade and we now have 4 states that have legalized it and even Washington D.C. is putting it on the upcoming ballot. Clearly popularity has validity. 3. That is not a statement that belongs in a free democratic society. We elect an individual to run the country based on the beliefs of the majority and there is no proof to say that the negatives would outweigh the positives that is purely an opinion. Euthanasia is an individual decision that does not affect the masses. ""What gives us the right to deny them what they so desperately want?"" Again we are not talking about something malicious such as murder. Policies change all the time such as those pertaining to marijuana. True we do impede on the choices of others on certain topics but euthanasia is a unique problem that cannot be compared to the wide variety of subjects you mentioned. If you like I could go into depth on each of these subjects to show why they have no relevance. Your logical fallacy was an appeal to authority since there are laws prohibiting your examples. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... This is similar to an earlier round where you stated that euthanasia was a slippery slope. That claim in itself was a logical fallacy called ""slippery slope"" you have shifted attention to extremes such as the Nazi's suggesting that people here might be forced into euthanasia. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... My opponent has also stated ""Refusing medical treatment isn't suicide, they are not ending there life any sooner than would naturally "" This is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature. ""Many 'natural' things are also considered 'good', and this can bias our thinking; but naturalness itself doesn't make something good or bad. For instance murder could be seen as very natural, but that doesn't mean it's good or justifiable."" Con contends that euthanasia is ending a life sooner than it would naturally so therefore it is not right or justifiable. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... http://listverse.com..."	PRO	201
S255646d7-A907f8e23	There should not be any type of ban on Abortion	First of all, I'd like to welcome dxpilot to this debate. I would first like to state that, there are many reasons there should not be a ban on abortion. First of all, it is the mother's choice, and the mother's choice alone. Simple as that. Post-abortion guilt. These effects do not always take place. Suppose a woman got raped, and she was worried about the child she was to have. She could, very easily, feel relief in getting an abortion, knowing that there will not be any other long-term effects. Although this seems a bit immoral, I do not think a growing fetus should be considered a human. Just like an apple seed should not be considered an apple tree. And although this seems just as immoral, it is not an independet creature. It lives much like a parisite, living off of it's host. Some may say that, when a pregnant mother is killed, it is counted as double murder. And because of this, there should be a ban, right? Wrong. It has often been proven that medical laws and procedures, can very much differ from the laws upheld in the courtroom. Prove me wrong.	PRO	202
S622af56b-A64d9af6c	Prostitution should be legalized in the US	Thanks to FT for taking this. I look forward to an interesting and good debate. A way this can work would be similar to how it works in other places and in Nevada. There would be legal brothels that are opened. This would run the same as any other normal business, meaning the federal government would regulate it. This includes and is not limited to taxes, paying the prostitutes, and making sure their is proper medical care and pay for the prostitutes that working their. C1) Regulation The issue with not regulating something is that you risk the activity still occurring whether or not you regulate it. Meaning even with prostitution being illegal, prostitution is still going to occur. It is estimated that between 84,000 - 150,000 women work as prostitutes yearly in the US[1]. Just in 2007 alone there was nearly 78,000 arrests due to prostitution, and this number is considered conservative because most people are not caught[1]. A primary thing to be aware of is that this occurs with anything that is banned and not regulated properly. Look at marijuana in the US. It is still illegal in quite a few places, but the underground market for it is insanely high. If people can find a way to make money illegally and without paying taxes they are going to do it. Regulating prostitution does quite a few things. It stops violence, keeps prostitutes healthy, and allows us to tax it. A) Safety People that often get into prostitution do it because they have no other choice. Meaning they are not educated well enough to get a job that pays enough to sustain them, or they want to do it and don't know what they are getting into. This sadly includes people who were raped, abused, or beaten as children[2]. Once women enter into this job they submit to their pimp. Their pimp pays them, he loans them out, and he basically abuses them. The issue with not regulating prostitution and allowing it to happen that way is it subjects women to all types of abuse and psychical harm. Most prostitutes in the industry tend to get raped in their lifetime[3]. Even more tend to get assaulted or physically abused [3]. Opening up brothels for women that want to be prostitutes allows them to engage in prostitution but engage in it in a safe and controlled manner. With the brothels being regulated like a regular business there is no chance of rape or physical abuse occurring . My adversary may say that prostitution will still occur under the radar which is true, but what regulating does is mitigate that down to a minuscule amount. If a women has the choice to go to a business and get paid like a normal job vs going to pimp, there is a very high chance they are going to go the brothel instead. It gives them guaranteed money by federal law, it gives them medical care, and it reduces the chance of harm to them in comparison to working underground. Experts actually estimate that if prostitution was legalized in the US , rape would decrease by nearly 25 percent in the us alone which is nearly 25,000 rapes per year[5][6]. Not just that but a study in Queensland shows that when brothels were closed and shut down, rapes increased nearly 150% percent[5][6]. This shows a direct correlation between rapes and non regulation of prostitution. B) Medical and STDS Not regulating prostitution also opens up a whole new type of problem. The women tend to get diseases because of lack of medical care. A pimp is not going to care if they have condoms or go to a doctor for check ups. Regulating the Industry allows the government to make sure they are taken care of as business owners would be required to make sure their medical needs are met. Prostitution is legal in Nevada and it is regulated so well that ironically Porn Stars have a higher STD rate that prostitutes[4]. Most studies show that women who had sex with men and worked as prostitutes report sad statistics. 47 % of women expected to have sex without a condom all the time, 73% reported that men offered to pay additional money if they had sex without a condom, and over 40% reported that they were abused when they mentioned using a condom at all[7]. Upon Inadvertently decriminalizing indoor prostitution in Rhode Island from 2003 to 2009, the state saw a giant decrease in rape and STDS[8] C) Costs This is a huge impact because you gain the benefit of taxation of the industry and cutting the incarceration rate for those that participate in the industry. Nearly 200 million dollars a year is spent on incarceration rates alone [9]. Per arrest on someone soliciting sex, it generally cost around $2,000 for each individual arrest. You up this to a larger national scale, you are looking at nearly 200 million dollars a year alone we spend in arresting prostitutes. That 200 million could be invested back into proper regulation, thus reducing the harm, and used for other programs. It is far to much to spend on arresting prostitutes, while keeping it illegal to begin with causes a net harm. We are basically paying 200 million dollars to maintain a ban that is a net detriment to society. Taxation is another major impact. We would gain nearly 20 billion dollars a year by regulating prostitution annually[11]. Prostitution itself is somewhere along a 16-20 billion dollar industry as is [12]. If we regulate it an estimated influx would occur and you would earn nearly 20 billion dollars of taxation alone, and this is just off the estimated influx alone. This number could easily jump to 30 or 40 billion dollars. C2) Consent This is a basic argument in itself but 2 consenting adults having sex is just that two consenting adults having sex. The reasons they are having sex is a non factor. In almost any case prostitution acts just like any other job. You do a certain task for money. Prostitution is no different. You are performing an act in which both parties are consenting for that has no negative effects and which is perfectly legal in every other regard, in exchange for payment. Sex is perfectly legal, so performing sexy for money should be allowed as any other task that you do for money as long as it is taxed and regulated. Overview Legalizing prostitution will (1) Reduce crime (2) Reduce rapes (3) Reduce Stds (4) allow us to tax it (5) cut unnecessary spending (6) Uphold common consent.

S7d8e5f55-A25b755cd	Obese customers should pay more for flights.	"The average healthy person has a waistline of 33 inches, the average overweight person has a waistline of 45 inches. Planes are designed to accomodate that. The average obese individual has a waistline of 60 inches. That's nearly TWICE what an average healthy person has. In other words, they need an extra seat. It's time airlines started accomodating that and start treating the obese like people. A good way to start is exchanging specialized seating for a set fee. Here's an image to illustrate. http://medicineworld.org... From medicineworld.org Or something less scientific, imagine sitting next to this friendly gentlemen on your flight: http://www.spurgeon.org... You can choose to donate half your seat to this guy, or you can do as my opponent says and buy yourself an extra seat on EVERY FLIGHT, just in case. However, had the airline intervened and helped the gentlemen get a specialized seat (at a slight increase in expense), neither of you would have had to endure that experience! But how much should they be charged? My opponent asks: ""$8 more per flight? So just how much extra should obese passengers be charged?"" Good question, perhaps we should have addressed a hypothetical amount before we started the debate. Most people when thinking about obese passengers paying extra fees jump to such thoughts as hundreds of dollars more per ticket. I don't think that's anywhere close to necessary. While $8 is a good start, maybe somewhere in the range of $20-50. We're not even talking about a class upgrade here, which can often be twice or three times the price of economy. We're talking plus-sized flights, much like plus-sized clothing. When an obese person walks into a department store to buy plus-sized clothing, does he or she not pay more for the extra fabric? Of course they do. It's only logical. Essentially this small price difference is meant to stay within the same kind of difference. Of course, the group of people required for this small fee would be small. We're talking about the truly obese here (BMI greater than 3.5), not the common overweight. Just like the fact that tobacco and alcohol use is heavily taxed to discourage their use, this will encourage customers to lose weight. And of course, this eliminates the need for embarrassing moments that currently plague the obese customers such as having to be asked to switch flights so one with extra seats could be accommodated. The obese are people too. -- Let's take a moment and imagine how this would work. When a customer calls an airline (or go online or meet a travel agent), they'll be asked whether they perfer plus-sized seating. This would obviously be quite popular (who doesn't like a little extra space on flights?) but the seats would be reserved for only those who NEED it first, and then those who prefer it. If an obese passenger opts not to take the seat (I have a hard time imagining they don't, it'd be MUCH more comfortable), airline employees would try to establish if the passenger is disrupting others before asking if they could upgrade. Think of it like reserved parking for air planes. -- My opponent says: ""Medical problems associated with contributing factors such as tobacco, marijuana and other drugs, alcohol, etc. all contribute to an additional increase health risks..."" And that's why marijuana and other drugs are illegal, at least where I come from. Tobacco and alcohol ARE already being heavily taxed, and why taxes are going up by millions per year to DISCOURAGE tobacco and alcohol use. These taxes are used as insurance so that in the case when they require extra medical treatment, it's already been paid for. Now my opponent has derailed from the previous 3 arguments to start a new format, most of which I have already answered in my previous post. Regardless, I'll address them quickly again. -- ""Obesity is preventable."" In most cases, absolutely. There are rare instances where it's a genetic issue, but until my opponent can bring up specific proof that unpreventable obesity is the norm, there's really no argument here. Because it's preventable, they should cover all the things that come with their choices. Including paying set fees for flights. -- Other transportation. People don't pay for subway seats. I'm not sure about New York, but here in Canada our subway tickets don't have assigned seats! I'm hoping my opponent isn't suggesting that Airlines operate the same way as subways, having to stand on a flight for 10 hours sure would be an uncomfortable flight. -- ""Therefore if one is so concerned about this HORROR, they have the option of buying an additional plane ticket just in case. Otherwise they can just take their chances and 90% of the time be a-ok anyway."" You're suggesting that everyone buy an extra ticket just in case they get assigned a bad seat? That's the reasonable solution to the problem? Again, my opponent has simply skipped over my arguments to form his own. An obese person is not a discomfort (like a crying child), it's someone who has taken up much of what you've purchased, an airline seat. -- ""Obese people are not the only individuals who fit uncomfortably on a plane. Tall or larger people in general (not necessarily obese) may also be the cause of some discomfort. "" True, at the moment I pay an extra 14 dollars when I book my tickets so that I can request emergency exit seating (for the legroom). So... you're proving my point for what again? -- lawsuits Could you cite one lawsuit involving an obese passenger suing an airline? Or anything like it? Or anything to suggest that something like this MIGHT happen? I'd hate to accuse you of making up random facts or something. -- At the end of the day, all this is just rhetoric. Because North Americans in general will be gaining weight as a population, the airlines will be there to fill that need, expanding programs such as plus-sized seating that obese passengers may opt to purchase. No matter what, this is an inevitability. Heck, it's the American way."	PRO	204
Sf3406593-Acb3247a6	Abortion is murder and should not be allowed except in extreme cases.	Unless the mother's health is at stake abortion should not be allowed. The argument that it is not a person but rather a collection of cells is a ridiculous notion and you could say that about any person. I do not know how a being a female gives you the right to kill something and define it as non human for your own convenience. There is strong medical evidence that the fetus is alive and by week 3 has a heart and by week 4 it has eyes. So how can you legitimately say that cutting the back of the babies skull open sucking the brains out and cutting it up and pulling it out is morally responsible or be legal. And to the person that debates me I would like to know at what point it is fine to kill this baby and when it is not ok.	PRO	205
S9fa39f2d-Adaced1a0	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"I wish him good luck and hope for thoughtful responses. I will present my opening arguments here. 1. Immoral One of the most famous philosophers of ethics was Immanuel Kant. He came up with a system of figuring out if an action was moral or not called the Categorical imperative. The Categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire. In using the this method Kant condemned all forms of suicide by saying the purpose pain is to protect one’s life [1] , such as taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one’s life was contradictory to the purpose of pain and was therefore immoral. We usually strive to be moral beings, so we should avoid from having immoral acts. 2. Subjectivity Due to the laws subjectivity there are never clear answers. In the Oregon Death with Dignity act Terminal Illness is defined as “means an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months"" [2] Things such as pain, suffering, or terminal illnesses are all subjective and you could get different opinions between different doctors, and why is the limit six months for physician assisted suicide and not four or eight months? There is no sound medical reason for why six months are chosen. Also, how do you measure pain? Does it include mental or physical? In Belgium people have been euthanized for depression, anorexia, and going blind. [7] Since there is subjectivity, it makes the law hard to enforce and have safeguards for. 3. Right to Die The courts have ruled on physician assisted suicide and there was no constitutional right to die. In the case Washington v. Glucksberg the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that Washington’s ban on physician assisted suicide was not a violation of the fourteenth amendment and there was no constitutional right to die. [3] They ruled the same in the similar case of Vacco v. Quill. As far as the courts are concerned there is currently no legal right to euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. 4. Slippery Slope The legalization of voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide would lead down a slippery slope to other non-voluntary euthanasia. The Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia in 2001 but have they gone down the slippery slope? In 2004 the Netherlands passed something called the Groningen Protocol. This allows the non-voluntary euthanasia of infants. [4] So, as far as the slippery slope is concerned the Netherlands is well on their way down and there nothing stopping other countries from following. We should not legalize PAS because it will lead to other more damaging things. 5. Voluntary? Voluntary euthanasia is not as voluntary as you might think. The most famous euthanasia program was the one that took the lives of eleven million people in the 1940s, the infamous holocaust. The victims of the Nazis were Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, Homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and people with disabilities. In particular the Nazis attacked people with disabilities with a propaganda campaign portraying them as burdens to society and their families. ""The principal reason people in a 1991 Boston Globe survey said they would consider some option to end their lives if they had “an incurable illness with a great deal of physical pain” was not the pain, not the “restricted lifestyle,” and not the fear of being “dependent of machines,” but rather that they “don’t want to be a burden” to their families. Family members who support the suicide of a terminally ill patient often unwittingly reinforce the notion that the ill family member’s life has lost all meaning and value and is nothing but a “burden.”"" [5] ""Many elderly people already feel a burden to family, carers and a society which is cost conscious and may be short of resources. They may feel great pressure to request euthanasia 'freely and voluntarily'. These patients need to hear that they are valued and loved as they are. They need to know that we are committed first and foremost to their well-being, even if this does involve expenditure of time and money. The way we treat the weakest and most vulnerable people speaks volumes about the kind of society we are"" [6] So, voluntary euthanasia/Physician Assisted Suicide is almost as voluntary as in Nazi Germany. 6. Pain Relief People say euthanasia provides a way to relieve extreme pain. This is like saying cyanide relieves depression. It is true that they don""t feel pain anymore abut they don""t feel good because they are dead. Now try it with the other example. It is true that they don""t feel depressed anymore but they don""t feel good because they are dead. There is also ways to relieve pain besides death. ""It is widely believed that there are only two options open to patients with terminal illness: either they die slowly in unrelieved suffering or they receive euthanasia. In fact, there is a middle way, that of creative and compassionate caring. Meticulous research in Palliative medicine has in recent years shown that virtually all unpleasant symptoms experienced in the process of terminal illness can be either relieved or substantially alleviated by techniques already available."" [6] In countries with euthanasia Palliative care is poorly developed. [8] Sources [1] http://www.siue.edu... [2] http://euthanasia.procon.org... [3] http://www.oyez.org... [4] http://www.nejm.org...

S9fa39f2d-Ad450238a	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Subjectivity ""How is there no option?"" If euthanasia isn't legal then it isn't an option, so there is no option. ""I speak from personal experience..."" This is a different logical fallacy called anecdotal [1]. ""Who's to say that they are not in their right minds? Simply being in pain does not inhibit your sense of right and wrong."" Pain will cause people to do things they would not normally do which is why torture is used to get information. Further, a super majority of older people suffering from terminal illnesses who attempt suicide suffer from depression. [2] ""if someone is refusing treatment while writhing in agony they are ignoring the pain that is meant to save them."" They would refuse treatment such as being hooked up to a machine, but that does not mean they are forgoing all medical treatment. As far as a child receiving euthanasia, there is a difference between deciding which parent to live with and ending your existence. Those two are not even close to being able to compare them. It is easy to ""force"" one's views? I don't like how you worded that, but it still conveys the idea. If force is needed then it obviously requires effort to enact such a policy. What is easy is saying do what ever you want. Gallup poll ""The flaw in this argument is that the popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity."" [3] To respond to why should we be allowed to force our views of life on others, because things have consequences, and if the negative outweigh the positives then no matter how many people think it should happen it should not. ""What gives us the right to deny them what they so desperately want?"" The same thing that gives us the right to stop people from murdering their neighbors even if they desperately want to. I already explained there is no right to die, so a policy that forbids euthanasia doesn't take away any rights. ""The logical fallacy is believing that we have the right to take away the choices of others because our beliefs differ from theirs."" This isn't a logical fallacy.

S2e3d8393-Aa637c21e	Heroin should be legalized	"Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine , should be made legal and subject to standards of purity similar to most commercial food products and pharmaceuticals. In debates of legalizing drugs such as marijuana, both advocates and opponents refer to Heroin as the ""hardest of drugs"". It is often assumed without saying that virtually all would agree that Heroin is one of the most dangerous illicit drugs, and one only the staunchest opponents of prohibition would even consider legalizing. This commonly held position is flawed in that Heroin is not exceptionally dangerous compared to many more popular drugs, both licit and illicit, and should be legalized regardless of the legal statuses of other drugs. One of the most commonly cited and misunderstood side effect of Heroin is the infamous overdose. The overwhelming majority of alleged overdoses can be accredited to impurities within the Heroin itself and the mixing of Heroin and other drugs. Heroin has a very high LD-50 compared to to the therapeutic dose needed to induce euphoria. One would in fact need to administer six to nine times their ""normal"" dose in order to induce a true overdose. Even if this factor were to be utterly ignored, Heroin overdose is remarkably easy to treat. A simple injection of nalorphine is usually adequate in preventing death via overdose. When comparing the risks of Heroin overdose to the risks of overdose by other drugs such as Alcohol and Cocaine, it is clear that overdose ""problem"" associated with Heroin is not particularly sinister, unavoidable, or even inherently deadly. Legalizing Heroin and subjugating it to regulation and a standard of purity would eliminate the deaths caused by impure Heroin and serve to reduce other health risks. http://www.drugpolicy.org...... http://www.ukcia.org...... Some commonly cited problems associated with Heroin are the allegedly inherent health risks, such as HIV, Hepatitis, vein damage, lung infections, liver damage, oral decay and other maladies. However, virtually every major side effect can be attributed to either impurity, improper administration, or environmental factors. Legalization would have a huge impact on combating the problems associated with not only with Heroin itself, but also on reducing the environmental factors associated with Heroin use. If legalized and regulated to a medical standard of purity, Heroin would not only be pure and chemically safe, but would be remarkably cheap as well. Heroin prices are inflated by the black market at levels exceeding 1000%, which is one of the primary causes of destitution among addicts. Many addicts are forced to stoop to theft and other crime in order to fund their habit. However, Heroin use does not necessarily entail criminal behavior. In fact, In a Liverpool Heroin clinic, an experimental prescription based system found people who were able to administer a steady supplies of clean Heroin were 93% less likely to commit property crimes. http://www.ukcia.org...... http://findarticles.com...... http://www.boogieonline.com...... Furthermore, as the prices of the drug go down and the purity goes up, drug users tend to be less inclined to subject themselves to intravenous administration. This can be demonstrated by the Heroin epidemic among United States troops during the Vietnam War. When soldier had access to cheap and pure Heroin, over 90% smoked, snorted, or administered it orally. After military crackdowns on Heroin usage and possession, injection became commonplace in an attempt to maximize efficiency and reduce costs. In this sense, cheap and pure Heroin would greatly reduce the problems associated with IV administration in that fewer people would subjugate themselves to IV administration. http://www.druglibrary.org...... The major and very real risk involved with Heroin is its addictive quality. It is on the same level of addictiveness as cigarettes and other tobacco products, although being comparatively harmless both to individuals and society compared to said products. Several studies have shown that fast food and junk foods can have addictive effects that rival that of Heroin, and yet pure Heroin is likely a more benign substance than most junk foods. http://en.wikipedia.org...... http://www.nydailynews.com...... This is not meant as a general argument against all prohibition, or an argument in favor of legalizing all drugs. However, prohibiting Heroin is clearly unnecessary, and legalization bears very little risk to society or individual health. Unbeknown to even hardcore drug legalization advocates, Heroin is not the ""hard, dangerous drug"" both sides tend to acknowledge it as being. Rather, it is one of the more benign drugs, and utterly incomparable to drugs such as Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Tobacco, or even alcohol in the category of physical and psychological harm."	PRO	208

S9fa39f2d-A7a2dc8dd	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Due to time constraints I will only address 2. Subjectivity this round. 2. Subjectivity I never said that it should be determined by those who are not suffering, I state that euthanasia should not be legal so no one is determining anything since there is no option. ""It is extremely rare for such a terminal illness to receive a different opinion for other doctors once reasonable methods of treatment have been taken"" What was your source for this? ""The chances of this person making any kind of significant recovery at their age is highly unlikely."" The chances of this person recovering after euthanasia is zero. The is at least some hope without euthanasia. "" A person has to determine for themselves what quality of life they have after such a thing occurs."" Like I stated people suffering from these diseases are not in the proper mental state to decide such titanic decisions. ""Pain is purely subjective which makes it even more crucial that the decision be left in the hands of the patient."" I addressed this in pain relief. ""patient has the right to refuse treatment which in many cases is a form of legal suicide."" Refusing medical treatment isn't suicide, they are not ending there life any sooner than would naturally happen. ""The doctor knows the patient will die without the treatment but they do not have the right to forcefully save their life by making them take the treatment."" No, and this is not what I am arguing for. ""The child has been deemed competent enough to understand the implication of death"" So, you want to bypass age of consent?

If it is clear that you cannot win a war, giving up on the war is the only logical choice. Why continue to waste lives and resources on an unwinnable war when the resources could be put to better use rebuilding the damage done by the war? The wasted lives I refer to are not merely rhetorical either. How many lives have been ruined not by the effects of drugs, but by the simple fact that people (the majority of them adults in a ""free"" society) got caught in possession of drugs that were not on the government's list of accepted mind-altering substances? The message seems to be, ""Misuse of drugs can ruin your life, so if we catch you with them we are going to ruin your life."" Legal sanctions have proven to be little incentive to keep people from using or participating in the production and distribution of drugs. There are several countries in which drug offenses carry a mandatory death sentence. This does not stop the drug trade in these countries. Iran executed over 10.000 people for drug offenses between 1979 and 2011 (http://www.ihra.net...). That's an average of over 300 people per year. In Viet Nam and Malaysia, more than half of all executions performed every year are for drug offenses (same source as above). With the astonishing numbers of lives wasted or lost, not due to drugs, but directly attributable to the war on drugs, we must ask ourselves as a society...Is this the best we can do? Is putting users, addicts, dealers, and producers in cages (or worse) the BEST solution to the drug problem that we can come up with? According to my opponent, eliminating legal sanctions against drug use would ""drastically increase drug use."" Drug use would ""become mainstream,"" the number of new users (including children), addicts, and overdoses would increase ""massively,"" and drug related crime would increase. Thankfully, we have a couple of real-world examples of drug reform that we can look at to see of these fears are justified. I will focus on the drug reforms that Portugal enacted in 2001. In that year, Portugal decriminalized simple possession of all drugs, including cocaine, heroin, MDMA, and amphetamines for personal use. The drug trade itself has remained illegal. While possession is not ""legal,"" it is simply a finable offense, not unlike a traffic ticket, that carries no criminal charges. Instead of a criminal record and a possible jail sentence, those caught with small amounts of drugs (about 10 days worth) are ordered to a 3-person commission that decides whether the offender should be offered drug treatment, fined, or given no penalty at all. In the vast majority of cases, no penalty is given. SOURCE--(http://mic.com...) The changes seen in Portugal since these reforms took effect are astonishing, and certainly counter-intuitive to those who believe that the illegality of drugs is a deterrent to their use. Five years after drug reform, the percentage of people 15 years and older that had ever tried marijuana was 10%, a decrease in pre-reform numbers. In the U.S., the percentage of people 12 and older who have tried marijuana is 39.8%. From 2001-2006, the percentage of 7th-9th graders who had tried any illegal drug dropped from 14.1% to 10.6%. Percentage of 16-18 year olds who had tried heroin dropped from 2.5% to 1.8% (a small increase in marijuana use was noted in this age group). SOURCE--(http://content.time.com...) In 2001 there were 1,016 new cases of HIV among intravenous drug users. In 2012 there were 56. New cases of AIDS in this group dropped from 568 to 38. At treatment centres, similar decreases were seen in the rates of Hep C and B. Deaths due to drug use decreased from 80 in 2001 to 16 in 2012. Due to decriminalization, Portugal went from trying 14,000 people per year of drug offenses to 5,500-6,000 per year. Not only is that approximately 8,000 people every year whose lives are not negatively affected by drug charges, it is a huge reduction in court costs, which benefits the entire country. In 1999 the percentage of people in Portuguese prisons who committed crimes under the influence of drugs, or for the purpose of supporting their drug addictions was 44%. In 2012 that number had dropped to 21%. The only increases in drug use that have been noted have been a small increase in the percentage of 16-18 year olds who have tried marijuana (although the percentage in this age group that have tried any drug has decreased), and, initially after reform, a small increase in the number of people who used a drug recreationally for a while, then stopped. After a couple of years, this rate of increase in new users declined to match those of other EU countries. The rate of past-year and past-month use (the best indicator of drug trends), as well as the rate of continuation of drug use (people who have used a drug and continue to do so) have both decreased. What this indicates is that people initially took advantage of their new-found freedom (freedom that any adult in a ""free"" society should enjoy), tried drugs once or a few times, then stopped using. SOURCE--(http://www.tdpf.org.uk...) Decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal has been an amazing success. Casual users need not fear criminal convictions, addicts have easy (and stigma-free) access to treatment, court costs and incarceration costs are dramatically decreased, crime is down, health problems related to drug use is down, and, perhaps most surprising, overall use of drugs is down, especially among young people."

S42f970a3-A7b16e776	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"I'm new to this site, but it's my understanding that the instigator has the burden of proof. In this round, many of my opponent's arguments hinge on the fact that cigarettes are currently legal. If we pretended that the U.S. had no current policy on cigarettes and were debating whether legality did more good than harm, my opponent's case would be found wanting. As such, I believe that you should use a utilitarian framework when weighing this round: which policy does the greatest good for the greatest number of people? My opponent's case came down to three things: 1. Prohibition's failure I've refuted this at length by showing that Prohibition failed because 70% of Americans drank and there was a populist backlash against the law because no one wanted to quit drinking. There will be no populist backlash against a cigarette ban because cigarette users are a smaller group, most of whom want to quit (Gallup: 3 of 4 smokers want to quit). Also, it was easy to hide the speakeasies because people would hide in an underground bar at night to drink. Smokers cannot hide their habit at work, where they cannot smoke indoors and cannot smoke outdoors without fear of getting caught. Going 8 hours a day without smoking is excruciating if you're addicted; it would be easier just to quit, than to force yourself to smoke only at morning and at night. 2. Economy My opponent points out that smoking is a $2 billion industry. This is always going to be outweighed by the costs to society of smoking in terms of productivity losses and higher health care costs, which is $157 billion a year. And don't forget opportunity cost – tobacco executives might be put to much better use running solar power companies. The tobacco farmland may be put to better use growing switchgrass for ethanol. An end to smoking does not spell an end to these people's lives – there are other options out there for them. 3. It's A Right To win that there's a basic right to smoke, my opponent would have to answer my arguments that the government can take away a right when the right impinges on the rights of others, such as the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and the right not to pay for smokers health care costs through higher premiums for everyone. My opponent concedes that the government can take away the ""right"" to do heroin. My opponent points out that heroin can kill you. My opponent therefore concedes that the paternalism principle (passing a law to protect people from themselves) is a legitimate reason to create a law. Even though cigarettes stop short of killing people all in one dose, that doesn't mean that the government cannot employ the paternalism principle in this case as well. I wish we'd stop referring to it as the ""right"" to smoke. It's not a right guaranteed to us anywhere in U.S. law. It's not hiding somewhere in the First Amendment. I believe for the above reasons that my opponent's case fails the burden of proof and fails to justify why a law that makes smoking legal is a good idea for society. (Note on the mis-cited #4 source. Go to the source website – the word ""tax"" does not appear) Moving back to my own case: 1. Economy Productivity losses and higher health care costs from smoking add up to $157 billion a year or $7.18 per pack. My opponent keeps bring up how productivity means we should ban bad foods, but the reason we don't ban ""bad foods"" is that no type of food is categorically bad. Even McDonald's in moderation can be part of a healthy diet (Jamie Oliver). Cigarettes cannot be part of a healthy anything – moderation doesn't matter, exercise doesn't mitigate smoking. If McDonald's burgers put tar in your lungs and contained cyanide, they would be banned too. My opponent's main response to health care is that we pay for things we don't agree with, like the wars in the Middle East (his most recent example). We pay taxes to go towards things that benefit all of us (whether or not we agree with those things). The wars in the Middle East promise to increase global security and decrease terrorism, both of which benefit all U.S. citizens and thus justify the use of tax dollars. Cigarettes do not benefit all. Non-smokers pay $7.18 per pack, but gain no benefits from smoking. 2. Lives It's never been refuted that a smoking ban could save 440,000 lives per year. Three fourths of those people want to quit but need more motivation. Also, a ban ends the problems associated with secondhand smoke. The electronic smokeless cigarette does not solve this problem considering that so few smokers employ this device. There are other carcinogens in the air, but none as concentrated or poisonous as cigarette smoke. Remember that any exposure to secondhand smoke as a child doubles your risk of cancer as an adult. 3. Marketing to kids Cigarette companies claim not to market to kids, but check out this picture: http://nicotinetimes.com... It looks just like a tic-tac. Allison Ellis of Targeting Kids says, ""Is there anything about this product that isn't designed with kids in mind? Let's see… the candy-like flavor? The youthful colors and packaging? The cute camel silhouette?"" [1] Each ad they see makes kids 182% more likely to smoke. If smoking were a clear-cut choice, everyone would have made up their minds and not be swayed by advertising. Yes, lots of kids have ""tried"" marijuana once. That's very different from getting hooked on cigarettes for the rest of your life. Marijuana, lacking nicotine, does not have the same staying power. 90% of people start smoking as kids. Isn't there something wrong with a product when adults cannot be convinced to use it – only kids can? I love this Truth campaign PSA I saw today: http://shardsofglass.com... Watch the first video now if you don't want spoilers. It shows an executive announcing that his Shards of Glass products are being recalled because they are ""addictive and deadly when used correctly."" What other product would we allow this with? When cigarettes were first put on the market, we were told they were safe - the tobacco industry later set up a scientific research institute to prove as much. When we found out that they were ""addictive and deadly when used correctly,"" why were they not recalled or banned, like any other product would be? Would we allow ice cream pops with shards of glass in them to stay on the market? Then why cigarettes? In conclusion, banning cigarettes would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It would add $157 billion to our economy by increasing our nation's productivity and decreasing our health care costs. It would end the unfair practice of non-smokers being charged $7.18 for each pack that smokers choose to buy. A ban would save countless lives and end the problems associated with secondhand smoke. A ban would be the impetus that smokers need to quit, considering that 3 out of 4 smokers say that they would love to quit if given the proper motivation. What other product is on the market where 75% percent of its users say that they want to stop using it but feel like they can't? Why are cigarette companies so ineffective at convincing adults to start smoking? (adults are only 10% of ""new smokers"") It's because cigarettes are a product that by all sane metrics does not belong on the market. We should have issued a recall on all cigarettes ages ago.

S42f970a3-A5ff1b88a	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"Smoking hurts our economy Subpoint A: productivity Smoking leads to a less productive work-force in the United States because smokers are more likely to develop a host of illnesses, so they are more likely than non-smokers to miss a large number of work days. According to Dr. Mark Clayson, smokers are more likely to develop ulcers, asthma, high blood pressure, chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, and heart disease. [1] In fact, according to the Vancouver Sun, ""Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally."" [2] The aforementioned illnesses mean smokers miss a great deal of work days. A study of 2,500 postal workers published in the American Journal of Public Health found that the absentee rate for smokers was 33% higher than for non-smokers. [3] The Center for Disease Control estimates the lost productivity attributed to smokers at $92 billion a year. [4] Subpoint B: health care costs Because smokers are more likely to develop a host of medical-related issues earlier in life than expected, they are much more expensive to insure, and their medical costs are astronomically higher. USA Today reports that smokers cost their employers 25% more money in terms of medical costs. [5] The Center for Disease Control estimates the direct health care costs of smoking at $75.5 billion. [6] The health care costs of smoking are often charged to non-smokers, in what is called in economics a negative externality. When smokers make health care costs more expensive for the insurance companies, the companies are forced to charge higher premiums to everyone, including non-smokers. The costs of smoking are not just bourn by the smokers themselves. Allied Quotes, a health insurance quote company, adds together the costs of lost productivity and higher medical costs to get a figure of $157 billion for the total annual cost of smoking to our society. [7] Although the typical pack of cigarettes only costs $5 for the smoker to purchase, Allied Quotes states that, ""Overall, for every pack of cigarettes smoked, that smoker costs the nation $7.18 in medical care and lost productivity."" The hidden costs of smoking far outweigh the actual costs. 2. Lives The Center for Disease control estimates that smoking causes 440,000 premature deaths each year, which amounts to 50 per hour. [8] These statistics only apply to people who smoke cigarettes, they do not capture the negative health impacts imposed by secondhand smoke. Although we have known for quite awhile that secondhand smoke is harmful, many people are still held captive to secondhand smoke when they go to work, eat at a restaurant, or as they wait for a bus. According to the American Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, only 47.5% of people in the United States reside in a state where smoking is banned in all workplaces, restaurants, and bars. [9] Even in those states where smoking is functionally banned indoors, many people cannot avoid exposure when they use public transportation, wait in line outside a store, or simply walk down the street stuck behind a dreaded smoker. This is extremely problematic for people with young children. According to Lynne Eldridge, M.D., a recent study found that people exposed to secondhand smoke as children were twice as likely to develop lung cancer as adults than those who were not exposed as children. [10] 3. Marketing (to kids) In addition, the trend in smoking is only getting worse as the $5.5 billion annual marketing budget of the cigarette companies persuades an increasing number of Americans to start smoking. A great deal of marketing is aimed at children because, according to a Surgeon General's Report, 90% of regular smokers started at or before the age of 18. [11] Tobacco Free Kids reports that each day, 3,000 children become regular smokers. [12] As evidence that marketing is disproportionately effective among the youth population, Tobacco Free Kids explains, ""Eighty-six percent of kids who smoke (but only about a third of adults) prefer Marlboro, Camel and Newport, the three most heavily advertised brands. Marlboro, the most heavily advertised brand, controls almost 60 percent of the youth market but only about 25 percent of the adult market."" In addition, a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that kids are influenced more by cigarette advertising than by peer pressure. [13] This is scary considering a host of other studies in the general field of psychology showing the enormous influence that peer pressure has on children. Lastly, two University of Arizona marketing professors conducted a study that found that ""each time a child saw an advertisement that appeared to promote a particular cigarette brand, the likelihood of being susceptible to smoking grew by 182 percent."" [14] Tobacco company executives have been quoted extensively as deliberately targeting children aged 14-17 during the 1970s, although since being caught, they have been careful not to explicitly state such intentions since that time. However, the de facto intent of cigarette advertising is to target people who are as yet undecided as to whether they will become smokers, a group of people comprised mostly of children, since most adults have already made up their minds as to whether or not to smoke cigarettes. The Economist recently argued that we should legalize heroin so that the drug proceeds could be re-invested in rehabilitating users. This would make sense, until the big heroin companies started advertising to kids how cool and normal it is to shoot up on heroin. Then the potential positive effects of legalization would easily be negated by the negative effects of advertising aimed at trying to make a negative product more appealing to young people. The ultimate impact is that the ""choice"" to smoke is not really a choice if we are inundated by positive smoking advertising by the time we turn 18. If the vast majority of people always made the right choices, we would have nothing to fear from legalizing harder drugs. In summary, banning smoking would add $157 billion to our economy from increased productivity and lower medical costs. In addition, a smoking ban would save 440,000 lives annually. Lastly, a smoking ban would reverse the bad trend of increased smoking among young people due to cigarette advertising. A smoking ban is fair considering how many of the costs of smoking are forced upon non-smokers by smokers, such as lost productivity, higher health care premiums, and forced exposure to secondhand smoke. If you're a smoker, next time you buy a $5 pack, please pay the non-smoker next to you the $7.18 that you owe him or her due to all the hidden costs. [1] http://ezinearticles.com...

S203a1bed-A207a5f87	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"I accept the Con position, and I assert that the state should either pass or keep existing legislation regarding drugs. My position is that all addictive substances should be regulated/taxed/criminalized variously according to their level of danger to the general welfare of the public. Specifically, marijuana, shrooms and LSD should be fully decriminalized though slightly regulated and taxed, tobacco should be heavily regulated and taxed, and the ""hard drugs"" should be criminalized with mandatory rehabilitations (not prison sentences). Pro's claim that ""The resolution doesn't imply a moral obligation on the part of the state"" is seemingly absurd, because all statements of ""should"" are statements of moral obligation. Morals are systems of expected behaviors that depend entirely on accepted values. The example given, that ""You should go to the doctor,"" is therefore just as much a statement of moral obligation as ""you shouldn't kill."" The former statement is another way of saying, ""Your health and life is more valuable to me than your money and time, and therefore my moral priorities compel me to encourage you to go to the doctor rather than to stay home."" The latter statement is another way of saying, ""The lives of innocent people are more valuable to me than your freedom to end their lives, and therefore my moral priorities compel me to discourage you from murdering."" The debate about drug policy likewise has morality at its core on all sides of the debate. It is a rivalry of values between freedom of all people to use all forms of recreational drugs on the one hand (Pro) and the health, safety, and freedom from addiction on the other hand (Con). As a libertarian-leaning individual, I have sympathy for the Pro side. However, freedom is not my only value. When George W. Bush infamously stated, ""There ought to be limits to freedom,"" it was an uncomfortable truth. We do not and should not have unlimited freedom, or else it would follow that there would be freedom to murder, assault, rape, steal, and violate software terms and conditions. We set limits to freedom, the same as all other values, according to a perceived maximization of our combined set of values. The so-called ""War on Drugs"" is almost universally acknowledged as a failure, due in large part to a persistent red herring: the unnecessary criminalization of marijuana. The argument against that subset of the policy is easily won. But, we should not be deluded into believing by the projection of such argumentation that the legalization of all manner of recreational drugs will likewise benefit society. Cody_Franklin advocates the full legalization of even the most dangerous drugs, so I will focus on perhaps-the-most problematic drug threatening the United States: methamphetamine (or meth). According to a study in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience, ""The need for speed: an update on methamphetamine addiction,"" September 2006, meth, described in the introduction as ""highly addictive,"" has the following effects: Withdrawal effects reinforcing addiction - ""Terminating the administration of high doses of these drugs in humans and animals induces physiological and psychological effects that are opposite to the acute effects of the drug (Fig. 3); these include fatigue, anxiety, irritability, depression, inability to concentrate and even suicidality."" Deterioration of quality of life - ""Most of them [youth abusers in Vancouver] perceived an important deterioration in their quality of life due to MA abuse."" Neurological damage - ""The more prominent of these include a loss of grey matter in the cingulate, limbic and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers, as well as significantly smaller hippocampi and white-matter hypertrophy. Longer-term MA users also displayed an enlarged striatum and subtle alterations in cerebral vasculature. A recent study has identified shape changes of the corpus callosum in abstinent MA users, including increased curvature in the genu and decreased width in posterior midbody and isthmus areas, which connect frontal and parietal cortices."" Bodily damage - ""In addition to the mental health problems involved with the longer-term consumption of MA [methamphetamine], use of the drug is associated with numerous additional physical problems, including dental caries, infection, heart failure and malnutrition."" Many substances are harmful to the body, but the danger abusers and to society is strongly magnified by the level of addiction. According to AddictionRecoveryBasics.com (http://addictionrecoverybasics.com...): The epidemic that is crystal meth has reached crisis proportions in North America, and around the world. Meth is generally easy and cheap to produce in simple ""labs"", often set up in dealer's homes. The drug creates an instant euphoria in the user, but is extremely addictive. The long term effects include brain damage, memory impairment, and extreme mood swings. The withdrawal symptoms have been described as ""physical agony"", hence the very high dropout rate of addicts from recovery programs. Addiction counselors say the relapse rate (of 92 per cent) is worse than cocaine. According to that source, meth is almost as addictive as nicotine--crystal meth scores 94.09/100 and nicotine scores 100/100. The addictive power of such substances is the essential point of the argument against full freedom, because the ability to make the reasonable decision of discontinuing the procurement and ingestion of the substance is all but completely crippled for everyone who is already addicted, and the essential element of freedom--availability of options--is likewise minimized. Everyone knows many people who have earnestly tried and failed to quit smoking. If meth use negatively affected only the users, then I assert that these arguments would be sufficient. However, the negative effects extend strongly into the larger community, among many of those people who never complied with meth use in the least. According to the abstract of ""Methamphetamine Use, Self-Reported Violent Crime, and Recidivism Among Offenders in California Who Abuse Substances,"" of the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, April 2006, Methamphetamine use was significantly predictive of self-reported violent criminal behavior and general recidivism (i.e., a return to custody for any reason). I finish my round of arguments on that point, and I await my opponent's case. To be swash, I strongly expect that he has an uphill battle ahead of him."	CON	218
S9fa39f2d-A2f6bc168	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Subjectivit How is there no option? They do not have to choose euthanasia and they would not be able to if they did not meet the requirements. I speak from personal experience as I have worked in the medical field so I've seen the people that wish for this to be legalized. The families are usually the only reason these people cling to life so for them to wish for death despite having family support speaks for the quality of life. ""A person has to determine for themselves what quality of life they have after such a thing occurs."" Who's to say that they are not in their right minds? Simply being in pain does not inhibit your sense of right and wrong. ""patient has the right to refuse treatment which in many cases is a form of legal suicide."" By your own method of thinking pain is there to protect us, it keeps us alive and by committing euthanasia they would be ignoring pains intentions which is to protect us so if someone is refusing treatment while writhing in agony they are ignoring the pain that is meant to save them. In both scenarios people are choosing to ignore the pain which is meant to save their lives. Therefore your statement of pain is irrelevant. ""The child has been deemed competent enough to understand the implication of death"" In a court of law a child can be deemed competent enough to choose which parent they wish to live with. In extreme cases a child can be deemed competent enough to seek out emancipation as well. Therefore there are almost always exceptions to age limits. Another example would be an 18 year old soldier being sent off to a foreign land and is put into situations where they might have to take the life of another person. They are deemed competent enough to fight a war but not to purchase alcohol. What's easy is forcing ones own views of life onto others when they are not the ones suffering. There are many people that wish to fight the illness till the end but there are also those that just don't have any fight left in them. Their will to fight has broken. Sometimes people try every option available to them and yet they still have no quality of life. It should be the right of the people to determine if they want to live or not. Gallup poll Bandwagon logical fallacy is nothing more than a theory of opinion. Why should we be allowed to force our views of life on other people? What gives us the right to deny them what they so desperately want? People have a nasty habit of sitting themselves up on a pedestal and telling people what they're doing is wrong but that is simply their opinion. To some people its wrong for a person that has some quality of life that they don't have the right to end their life when they have no quality. The logical fallacy is believing that we have the right to take away the choices of others because our beliefs differ from theirs."	PRO	219
S7d8e5f55-Ad666dae9	Obese customers should pay more for flights.	"- OBESITY IS PREVENTABLE - I have a few problems with this rebuttal. First, we have already established that obesity is not always preventable! Genetics and other factors (including mental health) contribute to the disease. Further, sometimes the medications that people are on have a side effect of weight gain. If my opponent concedes that people cannot prevent all forms of sickness, than he concedes that people have no choice but to take medicine... medicine which can lead to obesity, therefore my point is upheld. Regardless, while obesity may very well be preventable in many cases, consider the fact that my opponent completely neglected health risks attained from things like smoking in his rebuttal. It's easy to say that obesity is more preventable than asthma; however, medical problems associated with contributing factors such as tobacco, marijuana and other drugs, alcohol, etc. all contribute to an additional increase health risks... yet we don't charge SMOKERS extra for ""insurance purposes."" So clearly the cost of insurance cannot be a contention in favor of my opponent. What's good for the goose is good for the gander -- if this ideology does not cross apply to other flyer demographics, than obesity should not be singled out. Not without a law suit anyway (more about this later). - STATISTICS - My opponent has written ""since my opponent insists on an argument of statistics and precise percentages..."" which is completely false. I'd just like to clear the air and say that I do not want nor expect this to be a debate revolving solely around percentages. However, for my opponent to make an incredible, highly exaggerated claim in his favor without supporting sources is extremely abusive. No one is saying that you have to provide statistics for all of your reasoning, but what I AM saying is that it wouldn't be right for either one of us to just make stuff up on a whim and present it as factual evidence. - OTHER TRANSPORTATION - My opponent has noted that buses do not charge for individual seats. That is correct. They charge per passenger. My opponent then says, ""however, if obese passengers are indeed causing problems for the remaining passengers, perhaps extra fare is necessary."" Right here it becomes apparent that a primary contention for Pro is the comfort of other passengers. The problem with this is that transportation's primary purpose is just that: transport. Comfortable circumstances are a LUXURY - not a necessity. If a customer deemed comfortable seating a priority, he or she would have several options: upgrading his ticket to first/business class; choosing an airline that specifically accomadates for larger seating; finding other ways of transport (car, boat, etc.) and so on. Personally I'm from NYC and have taken many forms of transportation. I cannot tell you how many times people ride the bus/subway and HAVE NO SEATING AT ALL, regardless of the fact that they paid for the ride. - FLIGHT ISN'T A RIGHT - Nope. It's not. But here my opponent is trying to straw man my argument and completely turn my point around. He said, ""If a customer from a low-income bracket cannot afford the price of the flight, it would be advisable that they seek alternate forms of transportation."" I agree. So what's the point? Nothing. There isn't one here. MY point, however (supported with cited factual information), was pointing out the fact that there is probably a 10% chance that your neighbor on an airplane flight will be obese, due to statistics regarding obesity and its link to poverty, etc. Therefore if one is so concerned about this HORROR, they have the option of buying an additional plane ticket just in case. Otherwise they can just take their chances and 90% of the time be a-ok anyway. So here my opponent is trying to make you believe that I have suggested that healthy people buy additional seating on airplanes. I have done no such thing. My point was that if it is a huge concern to them, then they can. If they can just deal with it - or accept the fact that they have a 90% chance of being in the clear - then they DON'T have to buy an extra plane ticket. Simple as that. But my point here is why should an obese person have to buy an extra plane ticket to make someone else more comfortable? If it's about common courtesy and respect, then people should respect the obese too, by doing things such as 1) not smelling bad, 2) not bringing a crying baby on board, 3) not stinking up the bathroom, 4) not smoking as to up insurance, etc. However nobody has to pay for these inconveniences, so WHY SHOULD THE OBESE? Singling them out is wrong, and even if you disagree, my opponent has yet to prove otherwise. For instance, in response to the above, Pro has said, ""A crying child one may mute by putting on airline-provided headphones. Foul smelling passengers one may endure by simply turning on the airline-provided air conditioning. They do not lessen the product you purchased (the flight itself), even if they do make it slightly less desirable"" ... which is my exact point, except in reverse, obviously. That exact logic proves my case to be true -- having an obese passenger sitting next to you may make your flight less desirable; however, it is not lessening the product. Cramped space, smelly areas and other disruptions are inconveniences that ALL travelers face and deal with as a consequence of not being rich enough to afford their own private jets. - WEIGHT & FLIGHT - Pro acknowledges that an increase in gas prices is the #1 reason that the cost of flights has significantly increased. Another reason is that less people are flying due to the troubled economy. As a result, airlines are looking for every excuse to charge a little extra. They're pinching pennies at every opportunity. Thus, the charge for extra baggage is obviously going to increase. Now according to Pro, people pay for their seat... never did he mention that people ALSO pay for CARGO space. When people bring luggage on a plane, they are costing the airline money for things like, oh, the electric that powers the baggage claim area, the employees who transport the luggage, etc. Additionally, just as flying on a plane isn't an inherent right, neither is bringing luggage on a plane. Thus assuming that one does in fact pay for a seat on the plane, airlines have also agreed to say - okay - you can bring up to 100 lbs of luggage (for example). If you bring more than that, you pay. Those extra charges pay for increasing expenses in every aspect of flight, including gas. Similarly, an airline can charge you for things like soda on a plane. But to charge you extra per pound of body weight is discriminatory... - RESPECT FOR PASSENGERS - Obese people are not the only individuals who fit uncomfortably on a plane. Tall or larger people in general (not necessarily obese) may also be the cause of some discomfort. To discriminate against them could lead to a few things. First, it could upset customers so much that they choose not to fly at all... meaning that airlines are selling less tickets, meaning the 'skinny' people will face *INCREASED COST* to compensate for those lost sales. Second, while this idea sounds good in theory, putting it into practice would inevitably lead to countless lawsuits (amongst other burdens). This would not only be a waste of airline resources but government ones as well, and again cost others MORE MONEY... be it in taxes, other fees, etc. - FUEL - Back to the whole fuel thing, it has been said that 350 million more gallons of fuel are being used per year thanks in part to obese passengers. I don't have a lot of characters left for mathematical reasoning (though I'd be more than happy to explain it further in the next round!), but that comes to about 2.5 more gallons per flight - if that. So 2 gallons of gas is what...? $8 more per flight? So just how much extra should obese passengers be charged? That's it for now..."	CON	220

S2e3d8393-Afd517f8b	Heroin should be legalized	"Greetings, and thank you to my opponent for starting this debate. This will in fact be my first debate and I thank him for the opportunity and wish him the best of luck. (also I apologize for being a little late but I've been extremely busy the past couple days.) In this round I will present my offense as to why heroin should remain as it is, illegal to purchase and use in the United States. -----The Offense----- 1. Overdose my opponent argues that the overwhelming majority of deaths related to heroin addiction comes from an un-pure production of the drug itself. Therefore the logical thing to do would be legalize the production of it so that we can get standards on what's being circulated in the market. As stands only about 1% of heroin users die of ""True"" overdose. That still means that out of the roughly 560,000 people who use heroin 5600 of them will still die every year. What about those people? Do they not count? Legalizing Heroin isn't going to help that statistic. The best you can hope for is to reduce the number of deaths cause by ""impure"" drugs. If anything the legalization of heroin will lead to an even larger number of ""True"" overdoses due to its increased accessibility to all people. We can easily look back at the Prohibition of alcohol and see that contrary to popular belief the consumption of alcohol did decline during that period. This means that we can't expect making heroin easily attainable to reduce the number of people who use it but on the contrary actually raise the numbers and also the frightening statistics that go along with it. [6] [4] [5] 2. Health Issues / Criminal Activity The possible health issues accompanied with the use of heroin are quite extensive as my opponent lays out. This list grows even larger when considering other areas of peoples everyday life. For instance the use of heroin while somebody is pregnant can result in poor nutrition for the infant, inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight, serious medical complications and even unplanned abortions. While it seems pretty obvious to not take heroin when being pregnant it's right to overlook that area when considering the powerful addictive properties heroin holds. (which I'll get into later). The most serious health problems on the list comprise of overdose, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis. Most of these are linked to the problem of sharing needles. The use of heroin in the form of injection is the easiest way to get an instant and powerful euphoria granted from the drug itself in the form of morphine connecting to receptors in the brain. The complete legalization of the drug itself couldn't stop the use of needles unless it wrote in some policy to state how the drug must be administered. This still wouldn't help the problem as people are already using injection as the method of choice when it is illegal already. Legalizing it would only give them a cheaper, higher quality drug to inject. Smoking heroin or applying it orally will actually make them lose 1/3 of the morphine created by the drug itself when traveling to the blood-brain barrier, which is exactly why most people don't use that method. Also after using opiates like heroin, users enter a ""nodding out"" period where they become drowsy and space in and out. This would mean it would be another drug we would have to regulate even though it was legalized. After all it would be irresponsible of us to allow anyone to use this drug while say driving or operating any sort of machinery. They could hurt themselves or more importantly other people with this dangerous habit. We see the other issue when looking at it from the criminal standpoint. Unless completely unregulated as to how much heroin somebody can obtain, its impossible to say that you can feed somebodys addiction. Naturally people grow a tolerance to the use of heroin and therefore need more to achieve the same euphoria granted originally. Now unless the government goes completely hands off, then users will still be forced to look for their *extra* heroin elsewhere, thereby not at all avoiding the issue of criminal activities granted related to heroin addiction. Our great nation would only be helping to feed their addictions. [1] [7] 3. Price/Injection While price would in fact drop for people who feel the need to use heroin it wouldn't necessarily help the whole lot of us. we will now have the pleasure of paying for peoples heroin addictions with our tax paying dollars. Not to mention it's not possible to stop the ""illegal"" sale of drugs because people will always be trying to sell impure versions of heroin for cheaper than you can buy it at the store, and there is always somebody desperate enough to buy it. As for the method used to inject the drug, cost really holds very little relevance. As I stated earlier, it may seem safer to smoke the drug and it may even help for a little while. However, our bodies naturally build up a tolerance to this drug. Therefore people either have to buy more of the substance to maintain the equivalent euphoria, or use a stronger method of injection, which is in fact what lead to the use of injection in the first place. Once again legalization would do nothing to truly solve these problems. [7] 4. Addiction When talking about addiction there are many ways to define it. For an overall view we need to look at the power of the withdrawal effects, the strength of the reoccurring need to continue to use the drug, the tolerance buildup, the dependence factor, and the intoxication levels. Now when studies where conducted to test the addictive qualities of heroin it ranked increasingly higher than Nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, and even cocaine. What's interesting is that the majority of people who use heroin for the first time won't even like it. In fact they aren't even likely to try it ever again. However for the people that do like it, its extremely addictive and therefore extremely dangerous. Luckily there are a variety of options to help treat the addiction of heroin. The underlying problem is however, that if we are acknowledging that heroin addiction must be treated, then why would we ever distribute it to the public knowing it could open the doors for more people to be effected. [8] [2] Heroin is dangerous and the negative effects strongly outweigh any positive gain we may get from it. As i have stated legalizing it wont in any way help solve any of these issues, but may in fact contribute to making them worse. We shouldn't waste our time, money, or resources in the process of developing this legal distribution of heroin as a fix the the problem its created in our society. It seems we both recognize that the presence of heroin as it is, is in fact a determent to our society. I believe, and i encourage everyone else to see that the solution doesn't lay in giving up the fight of banning heroin and legalizing the drug but in looking for better solutions. Because of the overwhelming evidence i urge a Con Vote on this argument! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. http://www.nida.nih.gov... 2. http://www.nida.nih.gov... 4. http://en.wikipedia.org... 5. http://www.druglibrary.org... 6. http://www.heroinabuse.us... 7. http://www.heroinhelper.com... 8. http://www.druglibrary.org..."

S7d8e5f55-A5890a668	Obese customers should pay more for flights.	"First of all, I'd like to thank my opponent for joining this debate with interesting and intelligent opinions. I hope to be as enjoyable an opponent to have. 1. Cost of Insurance While there's without a reasonable doubt that obesity is linked to similiarly potential medical issues in comparison to old age, allergies, asathma, mental illnesses, pregnancies, etc, obesity is by far the most preventable one. As such, my opponent's suggestion that airlines be required to perform invasive background checks for all medical issues is unnecessary and without ground. Let us take smoking for instance. It has a negative influence on one's health, and as such heavy taxes are required on any purchases of tobacco. The same goes for alcohol. Most of these taxes placed on the products go to pay for medical insurance and costs, since smokers have a higher chance of falling ill from their habits. The taxes increase each year based on specific calculations for how much it costs to house patients with tobacco (or alcohol) related diseases, and it's balanced out. Those who choose to use tobacco pays this tax as insurance. Those who don't smoke, don't pay this tax. It's quite a simple situation. However, since my opponents insists on an argument of statistics and precise percentages, I'll consider the argument here as moot, and as such I'll move on. 2. Comfort My opponent has suggested that perhaps all modes of transportation should raise fees for the obese, and I don't disagree. In fact the system currently already has this in mind: buses do not charge for individual seats, cars are personal purchases allowing consumers to purchase larger cars, and trains typically are pre-designed with much larger space already; however, if obese passengers are indeed causing problems for the remaining passengers, perhaps extra fare is necessary. That said, the debate topic is that the obese should be charged extra for FLIGHTS, so I'll return to our original topic. The argument that since obese individuals are statistically likelier to to be from a less wealthy background, and therefore should not be required to purchase airfare would have been an interesting one if our political system was socialist. However, airlines are not governmental institution, and flight isn't a human right. If a customer from a low-income bracket cannot afford the price of the flight, it would be advisable that they seek alternate forms of transportation. It would, however, be unfair that others who have the income or capacity to live healthier pay for their flights. My opponent suggests that when you sit next to an obese individual who is taking up much of your seat, perhaps you should be required to purchase yourself another ticket. This is the exact unfairness I referred to. Why would those who chose a healthy and balanced lifestyle, who already pay FAR too much in taxes to pay for the medical fees of those who choose this lifestyle? Keep in mind, transportation through flight is NOT an inherent right. No one should have to pay extra so the obese can travel faster or more comfortably. In regards to my opponent's statement: ""Sometimes, life is unfair..."", I disagree. Is this the same as sitting next to a crying child or foul-smelling passenger? Absolutely not. A crying child one may mute by putting on airline-provided headphones. Foul smelling passengers one may endure by simply turning on the airline-provided air conditioning. They do not lessen the product you purchased (the flight itself), even if they do make it slightly less desirable. The product one purchases is a full seat, and a small one at that. When another passenger demands a part of the seat YOU paid for and refuses to reimburse you in any way, this is robbery. One preventable by having the passenger pay their fair share. 3. Weight & Money ""Many people blame George W. Bush for the rise in prices -- does that mean we get to charge all Republicans an added fee for contributing to our economic situation by voting for GWB? Certainly not."" You cannot be seriously attempting to compare the two. I'm going to chalk this up as humor and move on to your actual point. ""you cannot realistically blame overweight people for society's troubles, such as high gasoline prices."" And I didn't. Please read my previous argument, it's difficult to debate when one's arguments are misinterpreted. I realistically blame overweight people for raising the costs of FLIGHTS since their weight requires planes to burn more fuel. There's no question that the greatest increase in flight costs involves the increase in gas prices. As such, most airlines are starting to ""redesign"" their pricing for carry-on luggage as well as check-in luggage. Whereas previously most airlines allow 2 pieces of luggage at check-in, now the industry standard is one, with extra fees attached to the second. Current passengers are charged extra for overweight luggage for this reason, why are they not charged extra for overweight physique? :: CONCLUSION :: There's no question that a flight with mostly overweight passengers will cost the airline more than a flight with mostly underweight passengers. This is simple common sense. The question here lies in whether it'll be more beneficial to charge consumers who are obese more than those who are not. If traveling by flights is a human right, and airlines are government controlled, perhaps it would make sense to maintain the status quo. However, since air travel is still considered a convenience rather than a right, it seems unfair to lump the excess fees from the excess weight to the innocent consumers who strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps, when our technology advances to a point when simple physics no longer factor in the costs of our travel, it would not matter if our fares are justly proportioned. However, with our current situation, it remains unfair for all of us to carry the weight of a few."	PRO	226
S7d8e5f55-Ab1c88c65	Obese customers should pay more for flights.	With the rising price of gas and the growing costs of airfare, some airlines are starting to opt in programs that charge fees for passengers who are visibly over a certain weight. The reason for this is simple: 1) Obese customers cost more to insure. Those who are obese are more prone to high-altitudes medical situations, thus airline insurance for such scenarios go up. Since they currently don't charge insurance based on individual fliers, it seems unfair to charge everyone for the lifestyle choices of a select few. This is greatly different from those who are medically unsound by nature, such as seniors, since except in VERY rare instances, being overweight is a choice people make. 2) Obese customers take up more room. The current trend in flight engineering is to maximize the seating space to have as many people sit comfortably as possible. When a customer is obviously taking up more than his or her chair space and has in fact occupied half of other people's, it seems logical to require them to purchase extra space. 3) Obese customers weigh more. A study concluded that the 10 pounds Americans gained on average during the 1990s required an additional 350 million gallons of fuel a year. With the rising price of gas, there's no question that people should pay their own fair share. It's already common practice that those who want to bring heavier luggage or extra luggage must pay extra, it would only be common sense to charge for weight as well. With oil at an outrageous price-per-gallon as it is, does it seem just that you have to pay more because someone else chooses to not exercise? Of course, I'm talking only about those who are overweight based on their choices to overeat or not exercise. There are only a handful of people in the world who are actually obese genetically (less than 1%), and they can apply with proper documentation from trained doctors to have the extra fees waived. In this modern day and age it's quite easy to find resources that help people lose weight, and until they do it's unfair that the rest of society should pay to support their unfortunate habits.

S8712369-A65a03b4	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	"Thanks for the response. Let me clarify something for the readers that was brought up last round by lannan13. First of all, me and my opponent seem to be in completely different realms of debate. When mentioning Involuntary, and non-voluntary Euthanasia in the opening round, I am speaking in terms of a legal viewpoint. My opponents statistics that I am disputing are taking place not only outside of the United States (thus not even on topic), but are taking place in an illegal realm. My opponent is trying to play it off like I am supporting Doctor’s Euthanizing patient’s for their own agenda’s, which I am strictly against. So what does Euthanasia look like in a legal setting? This point hasn’t been discussed in this debate yet. As I mentioned in argument 3 it would have to be regulated. However Euthanasia taking place without the patient’s explicit permission could happen based on a multitude of scenarios and reasons. For example, if the patient is not mentally coherent enough to make the decision. Or if it is in the hands of the patient’s caretakers or the responsible party in charge of the patient’s medical expenses. In-voluntary meaning the patient doesn’t have caretakers in charge of the medical bills, and it is up to the doctor who has knowledge and experience in the area to determine whether or not medical resources are worth a month or two of extra life. These are just a few specific hypotheticals, but it would be majorly up to the law makers to decide how regulations would be handled. This is explicitly why I said “In some cases” in round one. So in summary, my opponent cannot just dismiss my arguments against him because he is drawing a conclusion from an illegal standpoint, whereas this debate is about whether the USFG should “legalize Euthanasia”. The resolution was specifically worded to avoid this issue being manipulated and spun to mean what my opponent wants it to mean. Resource Delegation My opponent ""Throws my argument out of the debate"" because of semantics. Explaining the difference in who actually does the killing does not make resources any less expensive, or the issue any less topical. Going on to costs, I have confronted my opponent about mis-information. The source he posted didn't actually have any of the information he claimed it did about the cost of lethal drugs being more expensive then the cost of keeping a patient alive. In the comments section he admits that he made a mistake and posted a new source showing that the drug is not as expensive was originally proposed. With this, I'll consider the argument conceded rather than accuse him of conduct violation in mis-leading the viewers. Thank you lannan13 for being honest. Here is the original source: https://public.health.oregon.gov... Here is the new source and quote he mentioned in the comments: ""Savings to governments could become a consideration. Drugs for assisted suicide cost about $35 to $45, making them far less expensive than providing medical care. This could fill the void from cutbacks for treatment and care with the 'treatment' of death."" -- International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide ""Frequently Asked Questions,"" www.internationaltaskforce.org (accessed May 27, 2010) http://euthanasia.procon.org... Quality over Quantity I have no clue what my opponent is talking about or if he even really understood my argument here. The laws against Euthanasia actually have nothing to do with abuse prevention as my opponent seems to believe. It has to do with a very old (in my opinion misguided) idea of morals and ethics, and the breach of the medical code of ethics. My opponent is shifting his stance from round 3 where he mentions doctors will be afraid of Euthanasia. yet is now saying that it will be mis-used? Which is it, will doctors being morally inclined not to commit Euthanasia, or will they run around mis-using it Willy nilly? If there is a middle ground, there is nothing that regulated Euthanasia will not solve. With any law there will always be cases of mis-use, that does not mean the law makers stand by the mis-users decisions, and that the mis-user would not be punished. Euthanasia Regulation My opponent resorts back to semantical arguments mentioned earlier here, but then entirely contradicts himself with his death with dignity source he posted above. The source itself uses the two hand in hand and almost illustrates them as being the same thing! It's like my opponent is avoiding the argument by trying to pretend that PSA is something so different and scary. Why? My opponent is dodging the issue of explaining why. At this point in time, my opponent has given us 0 reason to see why regulations would not work in the united states. Maybe some examples of where regulation has failed, like with Colorado's drug legalization- Oh wait... ;-) So even with Pro's ""regulations"" we won't be able to actually be able to properly help them, but kill them. Yes, lannan, that is the point of Euthanasia is it not? We are helping them from suffering. I have no idea where you are going with this, or if you are just typing words for the sake of typing them. Passive Euthanasia Again, not sure whether my opponent fully understands this point. I also extend across my arguments from last round that highlight the importance of seeing a Palliative Specialist which these cases have dropped to minuscule numbers. This is important as it helps evaluate the patient and their state. Euthanasia skips over the Palliative Specialist and has the doctor kill the patient at command. This has nothing to do with Passive Euthanasia. In this point we are beyond the point of fixing a patients case, they are for sure going to die, and it's just a matter of time at this point. The entire premise of this point is saying that patients who are for sure going to die, will die anyway, so why not cut off the last few months of their pain and suffering, saving tons of resources, misery, pain, heartache, etc for someone who is for sure, 100% diagnosed that they going to die. Over to lannans arguments. Framework My opponent is still proposing the holocaust is involuntary Euthanasia. I have no intention to debate that the holocaust was justified. That is not what In-voluntary Euthanasia is, and my opponent is continuing with a non-sense spheal that it is. I am not arguing for non-medical mass murder. The definition of Euthanasia was clearly stated earlier, and we should stick to it. Unreported Euthanasia Con States Europe has more liberal policies on Euthanasia and that the US would strive to emulate this. Why? Why, if legalized, does it have to be liberal, rather than strictly regulated and controlled? Also why is Europe the only path the United States would follow? No basis for this claim was given. Slippery Slope *Yawn* This argument is a repeat of his Hitler and holocaust argument, making a false claim that Euthanasia is something that takes place outside of a medical setting. Euthanasia isn't killing children unless it is in a *Legal* life threatening medical situation . Non-definitional, non topical, and manipulative. Also Euthanasia isn't open heart surgery, that is correct. Open heart surgery is a hit or miss thing, and often is something that if done right can guarantee a persons longevity. In the case of Euthanasia, a person is going to die and they are going to die painfully in most cases. If a doctor stops that pain through Euthanasia, that qualifies as ""Curing"" the patient to me. The doctor's own ideals are up to him. But if Euthanasia is legalized, doctors will either have to suck it up or the hospital will find some other doctor that can commit the Euthanasia. It's not like they are taking an axe and butchering the patient. Self Owernship and sickness My opponent talks about rationalism and quote Kant. My opponent seems to think I am coming from a bleeding heart perspective, which is entirely not the case. It is 100%. We see an animal dying and suffering, we generally will put it out of it;s misery (unless you have psychopathic tendencies and would prefer to watch it suffer). It seems logical that this rationale be applied to humans does it not? Suffering is a waste of life, and resources. Pain and suffering is really only the secondary value I am supporting, logic and rationality is primary in these key factors. So what state of mind does one need to be in to not want to die under extreme pain? We are human, but humans are animals, and we operate off of instinct just like any other animal. We react to pain the same, and have the benefit of being intelligent to know when life is being wasted and to be Euthanized would be an easier route for oneself, and perhaps in many cases, their families medical bills. Conclusion My opponent and I obviously have different ideas of what Euthanasia is, and have wasted a big part of this debate not understanding each other. However I feel I have won the important arguments. My opponent ceded in the comments that Lethal Dosage was less expensive. My opponent hasn't demonstrated how Euthanasia would not be properly regulated, and my opponent never argued that pain and suffering can be remissed through pouring medical resources into a dying patient for no reason. Under the lifestyle of the arguments I have put up, I think it is more than safe to assume Euthanasia would work if legalized. Thanks lannan, and good luck in the voting period."	PRO	229
S2e3d8393-Ae3bc07ac	Heroin should be legalized	"Overdose My opponent claims that 1% of Heroin addicts die of ""true"" overdoes. This is false. This statistic includes all deaths labeled as ""overdose"", even false overdoses. This is explained in the article: ""No doubt, some overdoses are a result of mixing heroin with other drugs, but appear to result from a sudden loss of tolerance. Addicts have been killed one day by a dose that was readily tolerated the day before."" While this article is interesting and provides useful data, it is inaccurate as demonstrated by the Consumer's Union Report. The Report sets three solid statements regarding alleged Heroin overdose. They are: (1) The deaths cannot be due to overdose. (2) There has never been any evidence that they are due to overdose. (3) There has long been a plethora of evidence demonstrating that they are not due to overdose. According to Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Baden ""The majority of deaths are due to an acute reaction to the intravenous injection of the heroin-quinine-sugar mixture. This type of death is often referred to as an 'overdose,' which is a misnomer. Death is not due to a pharmacological overdose in the vast majority of cases."" He found that the overwhelming majority of alleged overdoses did not fit the physiological criteria or show the signs of a true opiate overdoes. Rather, he found that many of the deaths resulted from the body reacting to the injected material as if it were going into shock. In many cases, the needles are actually found still inserted into the vein. This does not in any way shape or form resemble an opiate overdose. A true overdoes fatality takes between 1-12 hours to occur, with the physical cause of death usually being respiratory failure. http://www.druglibrary.org... 2. Health Issues / Criminal Activity My opponent claims that people will continue to use injunction as the primary method of choice even if Heroin becomes legal and cheap. There is a very large pool of evidence contradicting this claim. During the Vietnam War, soldier had ready access to very cheap, high quality Heroin. During a period of tolerance in which soldiers were allowed to use the drug, the vast majority did not inject. Over 95% of users snorted or smoked it, with a smaller minority taking it orally or mixing it with drink. Once the military cracked down on Heroin use, things began to change: ""The increase in intravenous use,"" Dr. Zinberg comments, ""suggests that perhaps as a result of the Army's righteous efforts to stamp out heroin entirely, the drug scene has turned nastier, with potentially unpleasant consequences. When a widely used drug suddenly becomes difficult to obtain, users will conserve their supplies for the greatest effect."" http://druglibrary.org... I would also disagree with my opponents assessment that injection is the ""easiest"" way to use Heroin. While it is the most efficient, it is NOT the easiest. Even injecting with dangerously poor form requires equipment and practice. Other methods of Heroin use can be done very easily, with the primary downside being the lack of efficiency. If Heroin was legal, this would not be a problem. One pure gram of Heroin costs approximately $10 in a fair market. This same amount would cost roughly $2000 in the black market, despite being diluted and cut numerous times. One can simply consume more Heroin rather than switch to injecting. I'm not sure what my opponent means by the statement ""unless the government go completley hands off..."". As far as the supply side of Heroin distribution goes, the government should treat Heroin similar to alcohol. 3. Price/Injection My opponent claims that taxpayers would be forced to bear the brunt of people's addictions. I do not see how this could be the case. A single gram of medical grade Heroin can last an addict for days, and only costs ten dollars. Compared to a nicotine addict, the Heroin addict has it made. My opponent also claims that addicts will cycle from less efficient methods to more efficient methods in order to bypass developed tolerance. However, history has shown that addicts will not inject unless the price and availability of Heroin forces them to do so. After all, if what my opponent stated were true, Alcoholics wold be mainlining Alcohol in order to get more drunk. Furthermore, tolerance plateaus, with the average addict plateauing at approximately 350-500 mg per day. At this point, the user will not require any more drug than he did the day before. There is also the claim that we cannot stop the sale of ""illegal"" Heroin. This argument is pure fantasy and makes no economic sense. There is no way for a dealer to realistically compete with a pharmaceutical distributor. I'm assuming that my opponent believes that an unscrupulous person would buy the drug legally, cut it, and then re-sell it. However, buyers have no incentive to buy from this person. Regardless of the volume of product he is selling, the total amount of actual Heroin being sold is the same, and they have no guarantee of the content. Furthermore, even if one were somehow able to trick people into buying, there is no incentive to enter the market. Black market Heroin markup is over 1000%. Fair market Heroin would be just like any other non patented pharmaceutical. In order to make a living selling Heroin in a legal market, one would need to sell an absurd amount of Heroin every day. If this type of business worked, people would be standing on street corners selling watered down beers to alcoholics. My opponent contests my claim regarding nicotine addiction vs Heroin addiction. I do not feel that this is an important point, as most medical authorities agree that the two come close, even if the particular order of severity is disputed. My opponent seems to be under the belief that I think that Heroin addiction must be treated. I do not believe this at all. Heroin, like most opiates, is within itself a relatively benign drug. Even if one is to become addicted, one can still live a very functional and happy life, especially when compared to those who are addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. The only reason one should be compelled to quit is their own self determination to do so. Heroin usage within itself does not come close to causing the same health effects or social costs as alcohol or cigarettes. In fact, many doctors encouraged seemingly incurable alcoholics to switch to opiates as an alternative to their much more destructive addiction prior to the War on Drugs. http://www.druglibrary.org...."

S203a1bed-A725781f4	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"It has been a lively and enlightening debate. I acknowledge that I have left many points and counterpoints unaddressed, and I will leave those and more issues unaddressed, granting Pro the last word on those topics. For my closing argument, I will focus very strongly on a single point presented by Pro: the contract analogy. To quote Pro: Further, he tries to make this argument about drug use reducing agency. Problem is, he's approaching this retrospectively, which is problematic. If I enter into an employment contract, they may stipulate that I can't drink, that I can't work anywhere else, that I have to work for low wages, etc. It may be the case that consenting to the terms of this contract really binds me; however, we cannot say that my agency is lessened simply because I look back on the decision, realize I screwed up, and complain that ""this isn't what I wanted!"" Meth use promises some utility to the user at the expense of something else--that's opportunity cost, Econ 101. In using meth, I know the risks, and I essentially agree to accept them (which it is no one's right to do but my own) by using. By Con's argument, we would have to ban basically everything, since all actions necessarily involve an opportunity cost (i.e. a limit on one's future options, which Con construes as ""losing self-control"". Plus, since the high from smoking marijuana (which Con admitted that he's okay with) can be construed as compromising judgment, and therefore compromsing agency. It seems that Con runs into a contradiction with this sort of advocacy. Since Pro has framed his arguments in terms of an employment contract, then I will use my last round to build on that perspective. It is commonly agreed that some contracts are morally permissible in our society, and other contracts are impermissable enough to be against th law (i.e. slavery contracts). I will write an analogous contract that corresponds to the implicit ""agreement"" of someone who is entering into addiction to methamphetamine. The source for the effects of meth addiction and withdrawal is http://alcoholism.about.com... ______________START OF CONTRACT______________ I, the undersigned, hereby implicitly agree to be addicted to the consumption of N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine (meth). I agree to pay any pharmacist as much money as is needed to satisfy this addiction for as long as the addiction lasts. I consent to the strong-potential occurence of all of the most serious effects of meth addiction, including loss of brain mass, violent behavior, auditory hallucinations, paranoia, anorexia, extreme tooth decay, and cardiac death. If, at any time, I decide to cease this addiction to meth, I agree to accept the strong-potential physiological conditions of irritability, depression, fearfulness, tremors, nausea, palpitations, hyperventilation, and extreme craving for meth, all such effects persisting for as long as several weeks if no meth is consumed. Further, I consent to these terms regardless of my age or economic status. For example, being as young as thirteen years old is no excuse for not abiding by these terms. Further, I agree that it is impossible to breach this contract. No explicit signature is required. All it takes to ""sign"" this implicit contract is to consume meth in a few consecutive instances so that the onset of addiction occurs. Though the contract is implicit, realizing the terms of this contract is not required for a binding agreement to the terms. _______________END OF CONTRACT_______________ I assert that such a contract is highly offensive and dangerous to our society, and I assert that state action should be taken to discourage the prevalence of anything closely analogous to it, in much the same way that slavery contracts are prohibited and strongly penalized by law. If Pro disagrees with the accuracy of this implicit contract, then I would like to know how he would rewrite it. If Pro agrees that the contract is accurate, then I would like to know if Con believes that such a contract should be legal in our society. If so, then I ask ""Why?"" If not, then he has relinquished the resolution. I will not use Round 4 for anything except a closing acknowledgement, per the agreement in the comments section."	CON	231
S203a1bed-A6ce03652	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"Descriptive/Normative This is basically a big red herring. I set forward in the beginning that the resolution isn't a moral imperative, and that's that. Basically, we can use moral arguments to defend our positions (contrary to Con's claim that I ""demand"" that he should only use non-moral arguments, which you can read my R1 to disprove), but it's not necessary. Values Con was using both a straw man and a slippery slope: the former by trying to characterize my argument as supporting ""absolute"" freedom, the latter by claiming that, to be consistent, I would also have to support freedom to harm others (e.g. murder, rape, theft). I never made the ""absolute freedom"" claim, which makes the latter claim irrelevant. As far as the ""plurality"" argument, my advocating freedom--freedom from coercion--makes the advocacy of other values irrelevant, because either they center around preventing coercion of others (which can be addressed under freedom), or personal taste, e.g. premarital sex or drug use, which are questions of personal autonomy. The fact that I personally advocate multiple values, for example, does not imply that I should advocate legally imposing them on everyone else. Self-owneship v. Addiction Actually, it does follow that contra-self-ownership arguments are self-defeating. Con is trying to argue that the government should be able to use force against me without my consent. It's similar to me making an argument that Con should be a slave. I cannot argue with him that he should be a slave, because the act of arguing presupposes his self-ownership and free agency. Should he agree to be a ""slave"", he would not actually be a slave. Similarly, that he is trying to argue (which requires presupposing freedom and the need for consent for the government to take action without peoples' consent is self-contradicting. Further, he tries to make this argument about drug use reducing agency. Problem is, he's approaching this retrospectively, which is problematic. If I enter into an employment contract, they may stipulate that I can't drink, that I can't work anywhere else, that I have to work for low wages, etc. It may be the case that consenting to the terms of this contract really binds me; however, we cannot say that my agency is lessened simply because I look back on the decision, realize I screwed up, and complain that ""this isn't what I wanted!"" Meth use promises some utility to the user at the expense of something else--that's opportunity cost, Econ 101. In using meth, I know the risks, and I essentially agree to accept them (which it is no one's right to do but my own) by using. By Con's argument, we would have to ban basically everything, since all actions necessarily involve an opportunity cost (i.e. a limit on one's future options, which Con construes as ""losing self-control"". Plus, since the high from smoking marijuana (which Con admitted that he's okay with) can be construed as compromising judgment, and therefore compromsing agency. It seems that Con runs into a contradiction with this sort of advocacy. Con seems to conflate self-inflicted losses of agency (like heavy meth use) with external losses (like being mugged, killed, or legally bound by the state). He tries to construe it as one party exercising control over another (ergo slavery), but meth isn't a conscious second party exercising control over anyone. It's like me inviting you into my airplane with the promise that I won't push you out once we reach 20,000 feet. Though it obviously limits what I can do on my property, I've given such options up by my own agreement, much as meth users cede total guarantee of future agency by engaging in meth use. The rest of Con's argument here basically centers on ""cigarettes are addictive, and Big Tobacco is bad"", which aren't arguments for legislation. In the first place, addictiveness doesn't justify a legal ban any more than dependency on paid wages (or on sleep aids, to keep the drug theme) justifies forcing the employer to retain an employee or forcing consumers to ration their Ambien. In the second place, ""bad companies are bad, good regulation is good"" isn't an argument, since it fails to account for things like tobacco lobbies and regulaory capture, which tend to be extremely common in the biggest industries (USDA and agriculture, particularly corn, FDA/EPA and bottled water, the ICC and railroads). His sources here, like many of his sources in the last round, shouldn't really grant him points because they're essentially supporting red herring arguments. If companies are defrauding consumers so badly, sue them for fraud. No force needs to be initiated. The ""Libertarian Solution"" Addressing his concerns, (1) It doesn't involve coercion if the terms of the contract stipulate mandatory rehab in the case of broken contract. The individual using drugs would be acting aggressively (fraud, specifically) by accepting payment and employment from a company while breaking his contractual agreement not to use drugs. (2) This isn't an argument--just a warning that things might be difficult if we have to change contract law. He basically argues that monetary compensation is insufficient (insufficient for what, first question); however, I can grant this without it damaging my argument. I specifically stated that contracts can include things like drug testing, which companies often do under health and safety policies [http://www.direct.gov.uk...], and can include stipulations like drug classes and rehab upon discovery of an employee using drugs. The point is that these things can be integrated into contracts, which renders government totally unnecessary. Further, he argues incentives, and basically points out that the cost to an addict of monetary loss is less than the utility gained from getting a fix. Problem is, his study doesn't really demonstrate anything significant. The current culture fosters a low time preference [http://wiki.mises.org...] anyway, and it's been repeatedly proven that people tend to prefer immediate gratification to long-term rewards [http://www.tinbergen.nl...]. That addicts had a lower time preference than normal is not indicative that state action is necessary. Drops 1. Con never really addresses argumentation ethics in detail. He pays it a passing glance near the beginning of his rebuttal by talking about how we should violate self-ownership to prevent people from giving it up (which I've already refuted above), but it's otherwise untouched. 2. Con never hit the WOD/economic analysis. 3. Con never addressed the othe objections presented in Section 2 of On Meth and Society (of importance is my analysis on the beginning about drugs and committing violent crimes). Additionally, to expand on my criticism of his meth/violence recidivism study, I want to point out that they only controlled for self-reported violence, general recidivism, and drug trade involvement [full study: http://www.sagepub.com...]. They didn't control for things like personality traits (e.g. impulsiveness) which could affect meth use and violence, which puts the validity of the study with respect to his argument into question (as the study cites methodological issues to explain an inconsistency between self-reported violent crime rates and violent crime arrests, based on variables for which they controlled, like drug trade involvement).

Furthermore in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution refers to the ""general welfare"" thus: ""The Congress shall have the Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. . ."" So we have taxes for our Military Defenses, but what about our Modern Day health concerns? What about those defenses? It seems to me that the easiest way to insure Tranquility and to form a more perfect Union, would be to make a healthier Union. Listen, no matter how Conservative one is one would argue through and through, until they're blue in the face if America deregulated our Fire Fighters, Police, Libraries, Post Offices, and Public Schools. All of which was not listed in the Bill of Rights, but all of which is federally funded and helps to make a more perfect Union. So why not Healthcare? Private Healthcare is a ponzi scheme, were only the healthy and wealthy can afford to be seen by a Doctor, (at least one that will give you the healthcare you rightfully deserve), but instead our healthcare system is based on money. Money that Doctors can get from you or your insurance, and giving you only what is provided by your private Insurance, not necessarily what you need to survive. As we approach financial cliff after financial cliff, and so on, I am reminded that health care, and the term ""pre-existing condition"" were a large chunk of my own financial woes. My wife has a terminal illness and we've sold her family house for pennies on the dollar due to the debt that her ailments generate. Nowadays she's too disillusioned to see the doctors, and frankly I don't blame her. Conservatives will say survival of the fittest. Which is a bastardization of Darwin's Theory of Evolution. According to Darwin survival doesn't go to the fittest, but to the species that's willing to adapt to change. In this sense of the word conservatives are a doomed species. Doomed by their ostrich in the sand thinking. By burying their heads in the sand and hoping for the best they accomplish nothing. Which is what they want to do to healthcare. Nothing. No regulations which would only led to Doctors, the healthcare industry, and the pharmaceutical industry charge what ever they want for the cost of their services. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 was signed into law by President George W. Bush has highlighted what's wrong with the conservative and Republican thinking, when it comes to healthcare. It restricted folks on prescription plans to just a networks of providers, thus severely limiting their medical options. It restricted prescription drug choices, by allowing HMO's to create more formulary plans, and care other than emergency care was restricted to a particular region. Lately, the Republicans in Congress are trying to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time. While Obamacare isn't the Universal Healthcare I dream of one cannot convince the conservatives of this. Their panic reminds me of Chicken Little warning everyone on the farm that 'the sky is falling', which it's not. The sky is very much there, and is still made up of the private healthcare providers that make us all put a price tag on our bodies. President Obama's greatest problem with healthcare is that he showed up to this game of strip poker half naked. The public option being the clothes that he left behind. As Bill Cosby said, ""I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."" That's what President Obama did with his healthcare plan. Now, it will be treated like automotive insurance, as you'll receive a fine for not having it. Democrats claim that costs will be made lower, but I'll believe it when I see it. We're the only western nation with no form of free healthcare. On average the poorest Canadian lives 3 years longer then the richest American. In the United Kingdom that number grows to about 5-7 years longer. In both nations even the conservatives wouldn't take their national health systems off the table, as healthcare (like police, firefighters, schools, libraries, and the post office) are viewed as basic human rights, and as well they should be. Conservatives claim that it would be a waste of spending to provide healthcare to everyone, (both rich and poor). However, I feel that the trillions wasted in failed wars, (including the failed drug war) are the wasteful spending, along with the alphabet soup of federal police agencies that plague our civil liberties. Admitted we need federal police agencies, but why do we need more than a dozen, when other western nations need at most two? I guess the answer would be checks and balances, but if that's the case why do we need more than three? In closing we need healthcare for all, and there are numerous ways to make it as to not raise taxes to the general public. One would be legalization and taxation of marijuana. This would not raise conservatives taxes at all... that is permitted he or she isn't going to be purchasing any cannabis. In addition to this shutting down a hand full of overseas military bases, and dismantling the ATF and DEA couldn't hurt either."	PRO	233
Sc99e004-A4c9dea56	Empathy should have no role in judging appeals	"Con implies that most Supreme Court cases are close decisions and therefore cannot be decided on the basis of law, so therefore empathy should be a factor in such cases. After making the argument that empathy is needed to render a decision, he makes a perfunctory contradictory claim, ""Empathy is not meant to decide the outcome of a case. Rather, empathy should complement and inform the judge's approach in a decision."" He never explains how empathy works to resolve cases without becoming a factor deciding their outcome. The idea that empathy can ""complement and inform a judge's decision"" but not be a factor in deciding the outcome demands an impossibility. It is no more than doublespeak for allowing judges to make decisions based upon their personal feelings rather than upon the law. Con is wrong in implying that most Supreme Court decisions are close ones, and wrong in suggesting that empathy is needed to resolve the cases that are close. The Supreme Court is an appeals court. The sole function of the Supreme Court is to determine if a lower court did not follow the law, including the Constitution. We expect there to be some close cases regarding what is and is not the law, but the methods for determining the outcome should relate solely to methods of interpreting law, not who a Justice feels ought to win. It's true that most cases appealed to the Supreme court are not accepted. We should expect that most of the time the lower courts got the law right, so there is no proper grounds for appeal. Of the cases accepted, it is not true that most subsequent Supreme Court decisions are close ones: ""A year ago at this time, [in 2007] the Supreme Court had decided 13 cases by votes of 5 to 4, out of 41 total decisions. That proved to be an accurate snapshot of a highly polarized term. By the time the court wrapped up its work five weeks later, a third of the cases, the highest proportion in years, had been decided by margins of a single vote."" -- ""At Supreme Court, 5-to-4 Rulings Fade, but Why? "" NY Times, http://www.nytimes.com... So in a ""highly polarized term,"" two-thirds of the cases were decided by majorities of 6-3 or greater. That shows that in most cases the Justices have a substantial consensus in their reading of the law. Nonetheless, there are cases where interpretation of the law is close. There are many ways to resolve close decisions based solely upon law when the direct reading of the law is unclear. Justices may a. rely upon a precedent of interpretation, even if the precedent is doubtful, rather than adopt a new reading, using the stare decisis principle http://en.wikipedia.org... b. rely upon analogy to a precedent rather than directly upon precedent, ""There are times, however, when a court has no precedents to rely on. In these ""cases of first impression,"" a court may have to draw analogies to other areas of the law to justify its decision. Once decided, this decision becomes precedential."" http://www.answers.com... c. rely upon a somewhat broader interpretation of the will of Congress or the will of the writers of the Constitution rather than a somewhat narrower interpretation, based upon law rather than empathy http://en.wikipedia.org... d. have a preference for letting a lower Court ruling stand rather than overturn it, for example, Chief Justice Roberts preferred to let the California Medical Marijuana law stand http://liberalvaluesblog.com... e. use legal principles of common law to interpret specific laws ""lex communis ... In modern usage, frequently used to denote unwritten law which is generally derived from cases decided by courts, and not from the express authority contained in a statute. As a general term the common law may express the general customs of English law (and those in legal systems derived from England, such as that in the United States), originating from its medieval inheritance, which refers to early laws, unwritten in form but administered by the common law courts."" http://www.answers.com... It need not be just one of these factors. We suppose that many appropriate factors related to law would enter into a Justice's decision in a complex case. The Court gets the big bucks, so to speak, for unraveling difficult issues of law. We have every right to expect that the Supreme Court can act solely based upon law, difficult decision or not. Pro cites the case of high school girl who was strip-searched for apparently inadequate reason. I feel sorry for the girl, don't you? Does it follow that she should win the case regardless of what the law provides? No. If she loses the case, parents in Arizona will be outraged that their local legislature has allowed such a thing. They will light their torches and start marching towards the State House. At that point there is a good chance that the situation is remedied, and in the process they will most likely clean up the body of law related to what is and is not permissible in searching students. Does a zealous Assistant Principal have the right to pat down a female student? The legislature should act, rather than having another case brought to the Supreme Court to decide. If the legislature does not act, then it will be an issue in the next campaign, and legislators will have to defend their stance, either successfully or unsuccessfully. Empathy should place a role in the voting process for candidates and for the voting process by legislators for laws, not the appeals process. The fundamental error in Con's argument is the assumption that the process ends with the Court, so if empathy does prevail in the Court, all is lost. That is wrong. What has been happening is that the Court is usurping the legislative role in making decisions. In Griswold v. Connecticut http://en.wikipedia.org... the Supreme Court overruled Connecticut laws banning contraception. The Connecticut laws were patently absurd, but the legislature had failed to act for fear of losing votes in predominantly Catholic districts. Had the Court not acted, it is inevitable the laws would have been overturned by popular demand. I am not arguing the Constitutional merits of this particular case. My purpose in citing Griswold is to make the point that empathy need not be invoked at the Court in order for empathy to prevail. In fact, if the legislature is forced to act, it is likely to clean up much of the whole mess it created rather than having the Court pick off one narrow point at a time. We should want the Arizona legislature to broadly define the bounds of school searches, whereas the Court can only rule that one specific instance is disallowed. Pro asserts, ""Empathy is not sympathy. Empathy is merely identifying with the thoughts, feelings, and state of another person, ... It is important when considering the person who was cruelly or unjustly punished. It is important when considering the person who was refused a fair trial. It is important when considering the rights of someone who has been oppressed for over 200 years. ..."" Why is it important? It is only important so the judge will base his judicial opinion upon feelings and not upon the law. Otherwise, the law would suffice. It is neither necessary nor desirable for appeals courts to use empathy to reach a decision. They should use legal principles alone. If a straight reading of the law is ambiguous, they may use legislative intent, precedent, lower court decisions, or broader legal principles to reach a decision, but they should not use their feelings for who they want to win. Empathy should remain the proper province of voters and legislators. The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	234
S9fa39f2d-A15250134	Euthanasia should be legalized with requirements	"Good luck in this debate it is sure to be an interesting one indeed! 1. Immoral As stated in my opponents opening statement this moral law is the creation of one man so it is based off of one person's belief system and that should not dictate the life of others as they might believe very differently from him. This is his statement on suicide: A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this: from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature. One sees at once that a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty. "" Immanuel Kant, Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals From his statement we can take two phrases: ""from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction."" This applies perfectly to the moral standards of euthanasia because it is not meant for a young teen suffering from heartbreak but primarily for the terminally ill whose shortened life will be filled with pain and suffering. His example of ""taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one's life was contradictory to the purpose of pain"" is irrelevant because in his example there is something that the person can do to make the pain stop. That person is not dying of an illness or suffering from paralysis from the neck down. ""feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life"" Pain is indeed meant to preserve ones life but the world is not so black and white that Kant's moral belief system should be absolute for everyone. In the case of the terminally ill pain is useless because there is nothing one can do to save their life. . Therefore Kant's moral belief system becomes irrelevant. We euthanize millions of animals every year under the premise that it is the ""humane"" thing to do because they would have no quality of life. If animals are allowed that humanity then why not us? 2. Subjectivity It is true that it is subjective but that does not mean that the lives of those who suffer should be determined from those who are not. It is extremely rare for such a terminal illness to receive a different opinion for other doctors once reasonable methods of treatment have been taken and there are many determining factors such a 90 year having to go through brutal chemotherapy after the cancer has been cut out of the body. The chances of this person making any kind of significant recovery at their age is highly unlikely. A person has to determine for themselves what quality of life they have after such a thing occurs. Pain is purely subjective which makes it even more crucial that the decision be left in the hands of the patient. A patient has the right to refuse treatment which in many cases is a form of legal suicide. The doctor knows the patient will die without the treatment but they do not have the right to forcefully save their life by making them take the treatment. The hardest part of this law would be to include terminally ill children. The standard for them would have to resemble similar requirements as these: - Every viable medical option has been attempted - Both parents consent - The child has been deemed competent enough to understand the implication of death Simply because it is hard to enforce does not mean that it should not be done. http://blogs.bmj.com... 3. Right to Die There have many laws created that do not appear on the constitution so to say that there is no constitutional right determines nothing. Terri Schiavo's case is the perfect example, her husband made the choice to remove her from the feeding tubes which resulted in her death. The federal court upheld the husbands decision. The law allowed this woman to starve to death which is a cruel way to die. Removing the feeding tubes was a form of assisted suicide because they knew for certain that she would die. Before her condition progressed she made it very clear to her husband that she did not want to be kept alive by a machine and he respected her wish. If the law is going to allow a person to starve to death and refuse treatment that would save their life it should also allow them to choose euthanasia, a much more humane way to pass. http://en.wikipedia.org... 4. Slippery Slope ""The legalization of voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide would lead down a slippery slope to other non-voluntary euthanasia"" This is purely a matter of my opponents opinion as there is no evidence to support the claim. There is no way to prove that what happened in another country would happen in America. Is there a risk it could get slippery? Yes but that can be said of any law that has ever been enacted. In America abortion is a very heated debate and on the border line of being declared illegal so to suggest that infants would start being euthanized without probable cause is highly unlikely but we should always be vigilant to ensure that no law is abused. 5. Voluntary The program set up by the Nazi's was murder plain and simple, it was by no means voluntary. They started targeting the ill and disabled two years before the attempted genocide of the Jew's which is known as the holocaust. They twisted it around to disguise their true intent which was genocide. ""Euthanasia Program The term ""euthanasia"" (literally, ""good death"") usually refers to the inducement of a painless death for a chronically or terminally ill individual who would otherwise suffer. In the Nazi context, however, ""euthanasia"" represented a euphemistic term for a clandestine murder program which targeted for systematic killing mentally and physically disabled patients living in institutional settings in Germany and German-annexed territories. The so-called ""Euthanasia"" program was National Socialist Germany's first program of mass murder, predating the genocide of European Jewry, which we call the Holocaust, by approximately two years"" To suggest that a euthanasia program in America would resemble anything similar to that of the Nazi's is completely absurd. There is no Nazi party here trying to find legal methods of exterminating people. http://www.ushmm.org... Below is what the Gallup poll found: ""Broad Support for Euthanasia Using ""Painless Means"" Wording Has Been Steady The alternative euthanasia wording -- describing it as ending a patient's life by some painless means -- dates from 1947, and shows the majority opposed to it at that time. Attitudes flipped by the early '70s, with 53% in favor, although significant opposition remained. By 1990, nearly two-thirds were in favor, and support has remained at about that level, except for 1996 and 2005, when it rose to 75%."" Law's are created in the best interest of the many and to suggest that most families would let a family member chose euthanasia without trying to persuade them is ludacris. Furthermore the patient would have to qualify for euthanasia they would not be able to have it performed without probable cause and being a burden would not be one of the qualifying factors. I will argue 6. in the next round. Out of characters"	PRO	235
S203a1bed-A1d7cdde6	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"Foreword Since Con admitted his mistake in putting up the R1 case, it's up to voters on the conduct point.. Framework Con retorts that we have to look to morality in this debate because it centers on values, but this isn't the case at all. When evaluating political philosophy, it is possible for one to be influenced by ethical theory; however, this is merely descriptive ethics, not normative ethics. That discussion may be influenced by moral principles does not imply that proving a moral imperative is necessary for victory. As I noted, it's perfectly fine for Con and I to make moral arguments, but the resolution is not intended to be framed as a moral imperative for the state. Con attempts to argue that even my ""you should go to the doctor"" statement is a moral claim, but it's one which makes use of a colloquial notion of ""should"", which implies ""it would be beneficial for you to go to the doctor"", rather than ""you're morally obligated to see a physician"". Moreover, I would like to point out that Con is making a slippery slope argument. He claims that we shouldn't have ""unlimited freedom"", because it would force us to accept freedom to murder, rape, and so on. First of all, I never advocated ""unlimited freedom"", so his objection is irrelevant. Second of all, we're talking specifically about the freedom to use drugs, not to initiate violence against other individuals. This distinction between limitations on self-harm and limitations on harming others is actually central to my case. Arguments Argumentation Ethics and Self-Ownership There are many theories of rights encompassed in ought-ethical theories like utilitarianism and deontology; however, these theories all fall victim to problems of normative contingency and crushing subjectivity. Argumentation ethics explains rights as presuppositions resulting from engaging in the act of argument, rather than engaging in violence. Hans Hoppe argues [http://mises.org... (starting around 339-340)] that we must necessarily allocate scarce resources--our bodies. By the very act of making an argument, I am exercising self-ownership. By arguing, my opponent and I both acknowledge each others' right to control exclusively our own bodies. In turn, we see that the nonaggression principle is also presupposed. Thus, communication with others necessarily assumes self-ownership and nonaggression. Should we attempt to engage in force, we must abandon argumentation, as we are, by using force, necessarily discarding that which is required to engage in argumentation. Conversely, we cannot therefore argue against that which is required for argument. My opponent cannot attempt to convince me to become a slave without running into a contradiction, as he must suppose free and autonomous agency to engage me (an idea originally pioneered by Habermas [http://plato.stanford.edu...]. Discourse ethics is distinguished from traditional ""ought-morality"", as it does not tell us what we ought to do--rather, it frames human action in a way which explains to us what it is logically impossible to do. Consequently, Con cannot make arguments which contradict concepts like nonaggression and self-ownership without contradicting himself by arguing to undermine that which is fundamentally necessary for communicative rationality. On Meth and Self-Harm I accept the harms, but contend they have no impact. Con seems to be presupposing that banning, regulating, or otherwise penalizing self-harm is justified. Whereas my discussion of presuppositions (such as self-ownership and nonaggression) is justified on the basis that we're arguing (the act of argument implicitly validating those presuppositions), Con is merely fiating presuppositions which have yet to be justified. Legal action against any substance is unjustified, regardless of self-harm concerns. It's true that the government could simply cease with argument and initiate violence through taxes, bans, and regulation; however, at the point that violence is used in lieu of discourse, we can no longer argue about justification. In other words, there is no way for Con to warrant this violence, as he cannot logically justify action to undermine that which he must presuppose to argue his justification. On Meth and Society 1. Con cites how cheap, easy, and addictive meth is on the black market, and uses that as a justification for a ban. Though saying ""X is really addictive, therefore we should ban it"" is, despite the emotional appear, a glaring non sequitur, the part about meth being cheap and easy provokes a bit of economic analysis. Earlier, Con opposed the War on Drugs in terms of marijuana, but argued that we shouldn't let that trick us into letting all drugs go free. Apart from the fact that the ""improvements"" in meth use (e.g. higher prices and lower use) were basically only temporary as the US heaped on a few billion dollars more (not even counting that violent crime rates didn't shrink) [http://people.ucsc.edu...], Con may still still argue that we have to maintain the WOD for symbolic reasons, as a show of our tough attitude on a social pollutant. Unfortunately, that doesn't hold up to the economics. The WOD has the effect that sugar tariffs had on sugar and HFCS (sugar, while not being healthy, is at least better than the zero-nutrition syrup, much like how some drugs, while not being good for you, are obviously much better than meth). When putting tariffs on sugar, prices spiked, and HFCS became the cheapest, easiest thing to mass-produce [http://en.wikipedia.org...]. Similarly, the WOD succeeded in driving up the prices and risks of many drugs. Production costs increased, finding ways to distribute became more difficult, and so on. For people just looking for a high, meth offered significantly lower costs, both in terms of money and in terms of risk (not to mention the ""forbidden fruit"" or ""potency"" effect highlighting the backlash of prohibitive policies) [http://mises.org...]. On the supply side, savvy dealers can make massive profits because of conditions creating increased demand for meth, sometimes playing with returns of up and around 500% [http://nymag.com...] [http://www5.semo.edu...]. Obviously it varies, but it's often tremendous. 2. His second argument about crime also doesn't offer a compelling reason to ban meth. First, if you're going to punish an individual for a crime involving harm of others, then the drug is irrelevant vis-a-vis crime. Second, the principle here is basically that we can ban things to prevent crime; however, there's no reason to believe this is the case, as A) he's already admitted that he's okay with marijuana, for which arguments can be made about committing a crime while high, and B) he would have to commit himself to banning things like rage and sadness, since those emotions can also severely compromise one's judgment to the point of committing a criminal act. Third, look to the contradictions I listed earlier regarding argumentation ethics--he can't argue a ban without having to abandon the very things allowing him to argue his justification (which is ironic, since he criticized meth as detrimental to autonomy). Fourth, his study also says that meth use isn't significantly predictive about violent crime recidivism, which means that it could just be going back to jail for drugs (which means that his study doesn't justify meth bans). Fifth, you can get the advantages of restorative justice/rehab through private intermediaries, like contracts with insurance companies and employers to refrain from drug use, and mandatory rehab and probation (like higher premiums or routine drug tests) as a stipulation for breaking the terms, which means we don't need coercion. Good luck to Con in R2."	PRO	236
S8c165140-A1b1a4124	All drugs should be legalised, change my mind.	Legalising drugs is very ominous! Here is a summary of why not to legalise all drugs: *Productivity costs to the economy *Negative social aspects *Addiction leads to crime *Legalising drugs will shift the deaths associated with gang/cartel/mafia warfare to drug overdoses *Impact to family and individual wealth *Impact to family and individual well being *Health care costs will sky-rocket *General tax payers will be impacted due to the shift of money being fueled into health care costs and in turn neglecting other areas of focus that have proved positive social impacts such as medical and science research, infrastructure *Driving under the influence of drugs will increase; which will lead to increase fatalities on the road As a society we need to focus on areas that will improve society, not hinder the progress and especially impose an unnecessary evil that will corrupt people. We need remember as humans we are vulnerable, and have moments of weakness that result in regrets. Lets look at a comparison of American gun laws V's Australian and United Kingdom gun laws. America has profound negative implications with guns literally being passed around like air around society, just look at all the mass shootings. Compare that to Australia and United Kingdom, for example the last mass shooting (massacre) in Australia was in the mid-to late 90s (Port Arthur Massacre); since more regulated gun laws no such event has occurred. I guess my fundamental argument in this paragraph is that when something, that may cause or have negative implications in society, is readily available it will do so, and on a grand scale. And even people that are morally opposed to consuming drugs, will have moments of weakness and this could irreversible regret. You might argue that legalising all drugs might be safer, because there would regulation and the chemical composition be in turn regulated, and hence deaths resulting from dud drugs could reduce; this might be accurate, but my above arguements would superseed that as mortality would increase due to utilising the substance even if it chemical composition was stable for a human to consume.	CON	237
S7d8e5f55-A1305a140	Obese customers should pay more for flights.	":: REBUTTAL :: 1. Cost of Insurance This contention is highly flawed. While obese customers may cost more to insure (as they pose a higher risk of becoming ill during flights), so do the elderly, those with allergies, those with asthma, those with mental illness, pregnant women, children in general, those who use/abuse drugs, those taking medication, etc. Because airlines do not require a background check before booking a flight, it would be extremely unjust to require specifically obese people to pay extra under the premise of an insurance issue, and not charge other potential 'threats' for the same substantial risk. Additionally, my opponent indicates that in only 1% of cases involving obesity is the condition genetic. I ask that statistics like this only be taken into account if they are cited/sourced, as it would be very easy for either side to draw up random stats that may or may not be true. Furthermore, I disagree with that figure on the basis of psychology alone -- I'm sure that even if 99% of obese individuals ""choose"" that lifestyle, there are some deep-rooted depression and self-esteem issues, which cause obesity to lean towards a medical (mental) condition rather than just a choice. Now even if you buy into the fact that overweight people choose that condition, you cannot deny my previous point that there are all kinds of conditions or circumstances which would increase the cost of insurance for certain flyers. To make this call for higher prices legit, you would have to agree upon charging a superior price for ALL flyers with medical conditions/situations that would cause insurnace to increase. Otherwise, a great deal of discrimination lawsuits would be on your hands, in which cases the airlines would be forced to charge migh higher prices for tickets than they already do in order to sustain legal fees. Plus, consider the fact that in order to regulate this kind of additional fee, new jobs would have to be created that deal specifically with insurance and charging passengers the right amount of money as designated for their flight. This would cause airline disruption, inevitably draw upon negative publicity, and most importantly cause the airline to shell out more money to pay the salaries of these new jobs and deal with other legal issues. In essence, the money that you are trying to 'save' is actually not profitable at all (it may even be an added expense), as new jobs would have to be compensated. And finally on this matter, you must take into account how many times one's obesity actually causes a MEDICAL EMERGENCY on a flight, to the point where insurance is actually even necessary. If the figures are low (and Pro hasn't given us any proof to indicate otherwise), you must find this contention to be entirely unnecessary and completely in my favor. 2. Comfort In order for this point to be validated, you must extend this argument to all forms of public transportation - not just airplanes. Therefore my opponent has the burden of affirming this resolution in terms of trains, subways, public buses, etc... in which case it would be easy to oppose for economic reasons. Further, a counter-attack may conclude that the airline be responsible for administering more comfortable seating for larger passengers; that is to say that bigger seats can/should be implented for comfort. You may charge passengers more money for this type of seating; you may even force a larger passenger to purchase a ticket for this kind of seating. However, you may NOT charge them extra for sitting in the same size seat as everyone else. Thirty percent of Americans are obese [1]. Statistics show that the highest demographic of obesity occurs amongst those of a lower class; in other words, the fattest people tend to also be the poorest [2]. Thus the likelihood of an obese person being able to afford a plane ticket is much lower -- say 10% (and that may be a generous figure). Now knowing that there is a 10% chance that an obese individual may cause you discomfort on a plane, a consumer has the option to buy THEMSELF an extra plane ticket, which would ensure them extra room for comfort even if an overweight person sat beside them. Sometimes, life is unfair and you make purchases hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. If you book a vacation in Aruba and it rains the whole time (causing you to have a disappoting experience), you won't find your hotel or airline refunding you any money for your misfortune. Similarly, airlines don't give you lower rates for the possibility of sitting next to a particularly foul-smelling passenger, or for being subjected to crying children. Better luck next time, mate. 3. Weight & Money --> The Real Issue There have been a lot of changes since the 1990s that have made things more expensive, specifically THE COST OF GASOLINE IN GENERAL. Many people blame George W. Bush for the rise in prices -- does that mean we get to charge all Republicans an added fee for contributing to our economic situation by voting for GWB? Certainly not. The truth be told, America has been looking for ways to promote healthy life choices by making it more expensive to lead an unhealthy lifestyle. For instance, we place high taxes on cigarettes partly because of their health cost. Similarly, ideas about making fast food drive-thrus more expensive have been discussed; Dr. Schmidt (an economist at the college of William & Mary) said people would expend more calories if they had to get out of their cars to pick up their food. The bottom line is, you cannot realistically blame overweight people for society's troubles, such as high gasoline prices. ""'This is like, let's find another reason to scapegoat fat people,' Dr. Oliver (a political scientist at the University of Chicago) says."" -- ""Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also wryly cautions against being quick to link cause and effect. 'Yes, obesity is to blame for all the evils of modern life, except somehow, weirdly, it is not killing people enough,' she said. 'In fact that's why there are all these fat people around.

S8bb4c1ee-Ad4cc0956	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	"As this is my last round, I will try to both respond to your points and sum up my arguments. I will begin by stressing that the title of the debate was ""Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal"", and not ""Cigarettes should stay legal while cannabis should be illegal"". Therefore, I think that the difficulty of changing is rather irrelevant, in the same way that ""We should use base 12 instead of base 10"" is different to ""We should change to using base 12"". Cigarettes do have ""May be hazardous to health"" writted on the front, and the same could be done for cannabis were it to be legalised. I am not a farmer and have very little knowledge of farming, but couldn't these farmers with hundreds of workers as you describe grow something other than tobacco were it to be made illegal? I stand by saying that I would rather people didn't die from lung cancer etc, and have farmers change what they grow. Again, I do not think the process of changing is part of the debate but even so I doubt it would have anywhere near the effect you discribe. An alternative source of nicotine to cigarette would definately be a good thing, but until that arises we should not allow people to continue killing themselves. ______ In conclusion... Cigarettes are more dangerous than cannabis. Recall, that in America it is estimated that more than 480,000 deaths annually are caused by smoking (1) in addition to 42,000 deaths to secondary smokers. That is a large number of deaths which could be prevented. The only reason it is the way is it is because of culture. There is little to no rational provided by Pro as to why ""Cigarettes legal, Cannabis illegal"" is the optimal scenario aside from the fact that is the current situation (in UK) and it would be hard to change. As I said (and should have made more clearly) the fact that it would be difficult to change does not affect they way it should be. Cannabis and cigarettes are very similar (except that cigarettes are far more dangerous). There is no reason why the legal situation should be different for them, especially not ""Cigarettes legal, Cannabis illegal"" scenario. There are strong arguments for both being legal or both being illegal, either by considering the abilty for people to choose for themselves or making anything that causes harm illegal. But there are little/no strong arguments why the scenario in question is correct. ______ To close, thank you for taking part in the debate, I've enjoyed it and hope you have too."	CON	240
Sa799c6ee-A9b805dee	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	This is my first attempt at a debate on debate.org, so I will apologize in advance for my ignorance of the process. I think that it is safe to say that drugs and drug users can never be eliminated from society. Having said that, there are a few questions that immediately come to mind. Should the production and distribution of drugs be regulated by governments or by criminal cartels? (Admittedly, it is often difficult to tell one from the other). Should recreational drug users be treated as criminals? Should addiction be treated as a criminal issue or a health issue? This debate will focus on the first question. Should the production and distribution of potentially harmful substances be legalized and regulated? I argue that legalization and regulation are far better options for recreational drug users, drug addicts, and for society at large than is prohibition. Prohibition, in my opinion, ADDS to the problem of drug use and misuse. It does not mitigate it.	PRO	241
Sc351e266-A2e43c51a	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"Thanks Whiteflame. For those who are curious, the sources Whiteflame used can be found in round 2 of this debate. http://www.debate.org... Resolution: ""The United States of America should legalize prostitution."" I appreciate the opportunity to debate such a controversial topic. ""Prostitution must be exposed for what it really is: a particularly lethal form of male violence against women.” (1) Argument 1: States Rights I will address the full resolution which indicates we are talking about a country wide legalization of prostitution. This would be a violation of States rights. “The regulation of prostitution in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government. Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate commercial sex…” (http://en.wikipedia.org...) Ergo the resolution that “The United States of America should legalize prostitution” is negated in so much as the United States Federal Government does not have the authority to legalize prostitution. Therefore the United States Federal government should not legalize prostitution. Argument 2: Prostitution should be considered a crime as it creates victims. The crux of why I stand opposed to the resolution is simple. Prostitution should be considered a crime as it creates victims. This argument will be in two parts. First showing definitively that prostitution is dangerous and second showing that the legalization of prostitution does not change its danger. In addition to this argument I will address the full resolution which indicates we are talking about a country wide legalization of prostitution. This would be a violation of States rights. I will be referencing this table through-out. (4) Argument 2 Part 1: Prostitution is dangerous A: Prostitution spreads disease As the table above indicates 50% of prostitutes have HIV in the world. In the USA it is estimated that 20% of prostitutes in America have an STD. “In the United States, the rate of HIV infection among prostitutes varies from state to state. In New Jersey, 57 percent of prostitutes are HIV-positive” (1) B: Prostitution is psychologically harmful “Many prostitutes experience post-traumatic stress disorder because of rape and other assaults as well as the trauma of daily sexual contact with dominant strangers.” (1) C: Prostitution has a disturbingly high mortality rate “Mortality in a long-term Open Cohort of Prostitute women” a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found the “death rate among active prostitutes of 459 per 100,000 person-years, which is 5.9 times that for the (age and race adjusted) general population. This corresponds to an occupational fatality rate more than triple that of fishing workers (the highest fatality profession tracked by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics).” (2) D: Violence against prostitutes. “Eighty-five percent of prostitutes surveyed in Minnesota had been raped, according to a 1994 study of violence and prostitution. In another study, Farley and Kelly found that of 475 women interviewed in South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United States and Zambia, nearly 75 percent had been physically assaulted and 62 percent had been raped. A 1994 study by the Council for Prostitution Alternatives in Portland, Ore., found that prostitutes were raped an average of once a week.”(1) Due to the spread of disease, the psychological damage, the high mortality rate, and the direct violence against prostitutes, it is empirically evident that Prostitution is dangerous. Argument 2 Part 2: Legalization of prostitution does not change its danger. As it has been established that prostitution is harmful we can now address if legalizing such a practice impacts the danger. “The U.S. Government adopted a strong position against legalized prostitution in a December 2002 National Security Presidential Directive based on evidence that prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and fuels trafficking in persons, a form of modern-day slavery. Prostitution and related activities, including pimping and patronizing or maintain brothels fuel the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate. Where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking. Few activities are as brutal and damaging to people as prostitution. Field research in nine countries concluded that 60-75 percent of women in prostitution were raped, 70-95 percent were physically assaulted, and 68 percent met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder in the same range as treatment-seeking combat veterans and victims of state-organized torture. Beyond this shocking abuse, the public health implications of prostitution are devastating and include a myriad of serious and fatal diseases, including HIV/AIDS… State Attempts to regulate prostitution by introducing medical check-ups or licenses don’t address the core problem: the routine abuse and violence that form the prostitution experience and brutally victimize those caught in its netherworld. Prostitution leaves women and children physical, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually devastated. Recovery takes years, even decades, often, the damage can never be undone.” (3) Conclusion: The Federal Government does not have the authority to legalize prostitution on a federal level. Such an action is a clear violation of States rights. Aside from this implementation issue, it is empirically evident that prostitution is dangerous. This is due to the spread of disease, the psychological damage, the high mortality rate, and the physical violence that accompanies prostitution. Legalization of prostitution does not change its danger. I conclude as the U.S. Government did in 2002…. Whether legal or not, “prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing.” The United States Federal Government should not legalize prostitution. Back to Whiteflame.

Sa799c6ee-A1317cc00	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	"At the risk of this debate evolving into a discussion on mid-twentieth century history and battle tactics, I will respond briefly to my opponent's assertion that Britain's position in WWII is analogous to the war on drugs. The analogy just doesn't work. There were plausible scenarios in which Britain could defeat Germany. Not only plausible scenarios, but since Britain and its allies eventually did defeat Germany, there were likely scenarios. My opponent mentioned a few himself. Britain's victory was aided by powerful allies entering the war, and Germany spread itself thin by advancing on multiple fronts. Not only that, Germany was losing the support of its allies, and was succumbing to internal opposition to, and sabotage of, their war efforts as well. One major difference between the war on drugs and WWII (or any other traditional military campaign for that matter) is that there is no plausible scenario in which any side in the continued war on drugs can claim victory. There is no end game. Drugs, drug users, and drug addicts can NEVER be eliminated from society. My opponent is in agreement on this point. Despite the efforts of nearly every country on Earth to incarcerate or execute everyone from large-scale producers to recreational users, the drug trade remains one of the largest industries in the world. An industry free from any reasonable regulations, in which the rules of conduct are dictated by some of the most immoral people. An end to the war on drugs, with all substances being legalized and regulated, would not be a surrender to the forces of evil. In fact, the continuation of the war on drugs provides the conditions for evil to prevail. I would also argue that the term ""war on drugs"" is a misnomer. This is not a clear war with a recognized enemy which can, at least in theory be defeated. There are no winners in the ""war on drugs,"" only losers. While I don't find the term particularly accurate, it is at least understood, and for ease of argument I do not object to its continued use as a description of the nearly universal strategy of criminalizing the production, distribution, and use of drugs. My opponent has stated that low-level traffickers often take the fall for large-scale producers and distributors. He also makes the case that lack of governmental control is largely responsible for the ability of cartels to maintain control of the production of drugs. It seems as though my opponent is making the case for government regulations for me. I have already explained how regulations on the production and distribution of drugs would effectively and immediately take control of the drug industry away from the cartels and gangs. This is something that even the harshest of legal sanctions can never do. During alcohol prohibition in the US, the criminal underworld controlled the trade of alcohol. Bloody turf wars between rival producers and distributors, with innocents caught in the crossfire, were not uncommon. Otherwise law abiding people who saw moonshining or bootlegging as a viable means to make ends meet had their lives ruined not by the drug that they were producing, but by the ""war"" on alcohol. Today, it is not altogether uncommon to find 10 and 12 year olds selling marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines on the street. Why is is that these same young people are not selling alcohol (except perhaps to other underage people who cannot legally purchase it)? The simple reason is that the distribution of alcohol is now controlled and regulated by the government. Any adult who wishes can purchase and use this potent and potentially dangerous drug legally. The same goes for tobacco products. And speaking of alcohol and tobacco, they are demonstrably two of the most dangerous drugs on the market. They are both far more harmful to their users than some of the drugs that are currently prohibited in much the world. Any argument that states that potentially dangerous drugs should be prohibited due to their inherent risks must, by definition, include the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. According to my opponent, I have suggested that ""products such as Heroin, Crystal Meth and Cocaine can be picked up off supermarket shelves and placed in trolleys or picked up from the selection in front of the till in a newsagents."" I challenge him to show where I suggested anything even remotely similar to this. In fact, I never made any suggestions as to how these products should be made available, only that their distribution should be subject to government regulations, and that properly educated legal adults should not face criminal prosecution for purchasing or consuming them. Every jurisdiction has its own way of regulating currently legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. In some places, beer, wine, and spirits can be purchased in grocery stores. In other places, only beer and wine can be sold in grocery stores. In Canada, where I live, all alcohol products can only be sold in licensed facilities that primarily sell alcohol and alcohol related products; minors are not even allowed in the door (how many cocaine dealers do you think have the same policy?). Here, tobacco companies cannot advertise, and tobacco products must not be visible to the public wherever they are sold. They are kept in closed cases. I would like to see drugs sold in designated, licensed facilities, not unlike liquor stores. Perhaps even single product facilities where only a single drug, or type of drug is sold. My opponent is correct in stating that Portugal did not enact full legalization and regulation of the drug trade. The incredible improvements seen in Portugal, improvements which cannot be denied nor overstated, were made despite the fact that Portugal left the drug trade in the hands of unregulated criminal cartels and gangs. As I mentioned, Portugal still tries around 6,000 people per year on drug related charges, presumably for importing and selling. That is still a huge waste of resources when the alternative is to license and regulate producers and distributors, and perform regular inspections to insure compliance, as with any other industry. Not only is it a huge waste of resources, but the cartels and gangs are still able to recruit vulnerable individuals who are often otherwise law abiding citizens and addicts to carry out the dirty work and, as my opponent mentioned, take the fall when law enforcement comes knocking. Adults in a free society should be free to make their own choices, even poor choices, so long as their actions do not harm others. Using drugs may harm the user, but unless the user is also committing other crimes, this should not be a criminal matter. **After reading several other debates here, I realize that a rule stipulating no new arguments in the last round is useful for bringing a debate to a tidy end. If my opponent agrees, I'd like to propose such a rule. This gives us one more round to make arguments and rebuttals, and a final round to wrap up any loose ends and reiterate our main points. However, I understand if my opponent would rather not agree to this change at such a late stage in the debate."	PRO	243

S42f970a3-Af0aea5f8	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"Food: My opponent does not answer my essential assertion that eating unhealthy food is a choice much like smoking cigarettes are a choice. So I'll rephrase my argument again, My opponent's objections to cigarettes being illegal are that it is unhealthy, but why do we necessary have to live healthy lives? The meaning of life varies among many people, there are those who seek to live as long as possible, there are others who choose to live for the moment. If a man decides that smoking a cigarette is worth the risk of the illnesses and a short life, then who are we to prohibit that? Health care: My argument isn't limited to merely abortions, there are plenty of taxes that we pay for things we don't believe in. There are plenty of wasted U.S. dollars, at least in the case of cigarettes the money is used for the right to smoke. ""Proving we sometimes pay for things we don't do is not a good justification for legality."" Which is my point. My opponent asserts that cigarettes should be illegal because it is expensive. Marketing to kids: The manufacturers that advertise the products is of fault, not the product itself. It is asinine to make cigarettes illegal because the manufacturers are subtly breaking the law. The product cannot be blamed for the fault of the producer. ""A lot of peer pressure happens older to younger, meaning an 18 year old, who can now legally purchase cigarettes, pressuring someone younger than him to start smoking. Illegality makes peer pressure more difficult."" Almost half of the teens in the US have tried marijuana [1]. It is illegal, and yet does nothing to deter peer pressure or abuse. Making cigarettes illegal will provide minimal efficiency in deducing peer pressure. The same is with Alcohol, which is legal. Furthermore, an older teen distributing cigarette to younger kids is an illegal act, and therefore the older teen should be responsible in accordance to the law. Making cigarettes illegal because of an illegal act committed by teens is nonsensical. ""Many people (90%) get hooked as children when they think smoking is really cool, and they are less likely to worry about their health. They then find it hard to quit. Remember the Gallup poll that 3 out of 4 smokers want to quit but feel that they can't because cigarettes are too addictive."" ""My opponent points out that people can choose to quit. I would assert that it's not as easy as he makes it sound. The fact that he cites a forum where people who are trying to quit congregate and help each other proves how difficult quitting actually is. If it were easy, no such forum would be necessary."" I never said quitting was easy, but my opponent makes it sound like it's impossible. There are smokers that quit, meaning there is a choice factor involved. If one is resolute in his decision to quit, then one can do it. Secondhand smoke There are unhealthy particles all over the atmosphere. Forgive the informality, but sh!t happens. Secondhand smoke isn't deliberate, and usually smokers have the decency to flick the cigarette or distance themselves, if you ask them to. Cars drive by and spray smoke all over the atmosphere; it doesn't mean we are going to ban cars. Also, my opponent has yet to answer my Electronic Cigarettes alternative, which produces no secondhand smoke. Right to smoke: Heroin can be overdosed very easily, which leads to death. Long time users develop a tolerance for it, to a degree where the user needs to inject have amounts just to feel ""normal"". People do not overdose on nicotine, and neither does cigarette have nearly the potency to do what heroine does. I have already given my response as to why heroine is illegal in contrast to cigarettes. No one has ever overdosed on cigarettes, and the effects of cigarettes, which is at best, a ""buzz"". In the case of heroine, you feel something completely different that is incomparable to cigarettes. This is why heroine is illegal, while cigarettes remain legal. Prohibition: ""Also, keep in mind that unlike alcohol, which is usually consumed once a day, at night, inside a building, cigarettes are usually consumed multiple times a day, outside."" Many smokers smoke indoors, in the privacy and comfort of their homes. My opponent asserts that quitting cigarettes is no easy deal, and yet he believes that all it will take to make people quit is to simply ban them. If it were that easy, there would be no crimes regarding drugs. Which brings me back to my initial point that banning cigarettes has no guarantee that smokers will quit. $7.18 My argument was that there are things that we spend money on that we don't agree on, such as the wars in the Middle East, along numerous others. My opponent might not agree with how his tax dollars are spent, but we must remember that there are those who do agree with them. ""My opponent must mis-cite his source (his #4), because I can't find any reference to tax dollars, but I also assume that $157 billion a year is much more than what he is referencing."" I cited source #4 in reference to the amount of tax that is wasted. Employment My opponent has no answers for the unemployment that banning cigarettes would cause, such as the damage to tobacco farmers and cigarette companies, which harbor innumerable employees. My summary will be extended with additional details, In summary, banning cigarettes won't make people quit. If anything, it will become ""cool"" and more daring to try, especially for teens, which is counterproductive. At the same time, we lose all tax revenue from cigarettes, if we were to ban the product, while still having to pay for loss productivity and smoking related illnesses, in the case that cigarettes are banned, and smokers continue to smoke. Not to mention, myriads would be unemployed as a result. All of us are accountable for the choices we make in our lives, some choices will be bad, others good. It is ideal to make only good choices in life, but once we start enforcing the ""good"" choices, we have no choices to make at all. Regarding my opponent's objection that smoking is not a choice, if a smoker really wants to quit, they can do it. There are numerous ex-smokers, who CHOSE to quit. I thank my opponent for a good debate, and leave the rest to the voters. Sources: [1] http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov..."	CON	248

S1b53d7af-A8cf9a2ad	Recreational Drugs should be Legalized	"I feel that all drugs should be legalized for a variety of reasons. Legalizing and regulating drugs will not only benefit society and the economy, but will benefit drug users and may actually lower the rate of drug use. I will now post several reasons to support my argument: 1) Recreational drugs are perhaps the most widely traded product on the black market. By making them illegal, the black market receives more funds for perpetuating other illegal activities. Essentially, by making the drug trade illegal, you give funding to potentially worse criminal activity. 2) The billions of dollars tied up in the drug market would go to legitimate business owners if the practice were made legal. Not only will this allow for these transfer of funds to be subject to taxation, but the recipients of the money are less likely to be involved in other illegal activities. Since their money is now legitimate, they can use it for investment in other, perhaps more respectable endeavors without scrutiny. 3) Drugs are addicting, and many of the people using them do so because of their addiction and not necessarily because they really want to be. They realize that the drugs are damaging their lives, but they resist getting help because they are afraid of the law. The law should reach out to help these people, not cast them away as criminals. 4) Finally, the tax dollars collected from drug purchases could go to funding drug education and rehabilitation facilities. A person purchasing heroine should be fully aware of the consequences of their decision and should have access to clean needles and ""safe"" drugs that are not cut with other poisons, if that is their decision. Tell a person no, you're not allowed to may make them want to do it more. Tell them that they can, but it will ruin their life, and the psychological effect is entirely different."	PRO	250

But the reasons you give are at least unproven conjecture and mostly disproven positions. 1) I agree that recreational drugs are widely traded and used on the black market, you fail to substantiate that black marketeers profit unduly from the fact of the illegality. You assert that making drugs illegal, gives funding for potentially worse criminal activity. This is equivalent to saying that making rape illegal causes pimps to make more money in prostitution. 2) In this justification you have put money ahead of the ruined lives of addicts, their families and society. 3) I agree that the law should be less interested in catching and punishing users, but as a society we should be severe in the punishment of the criminals who smuggle in and sell the drugs. Perhaps capital punishment for top kingpin and those who are repeat offenders. 4) This justification is just too far from fact to deal with. Did you ever read of the terrible results of this very experiments in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Zurich, Switzerland? For the past 20 yers, the Swiss have tolerated heroin and other drug use, as a result, Switzerland now has one of the highest rates of heroin addiction in the world.

S6c2b1862-A1c37bf0e	Recreational cannabis should be illegal.	In this debate, I will attempt to explain why recreational cannabis should be illegal, and I would like to begin my opening argument by touching on how cannabis affects the brain. It's no secret that cannabis, being the hallucinogen that it is, changes your brain chemistry. The question is, what does this change of brain chemistry mean? Cannabis affects adolescents in a more negative way, than it affects adults, as the brain of adolescents is still developing. In a society where cannabis is legal, it's undoubtedly going to be smoked by those that are under age. We should make cannabis illegal to protect our children if nothing else. http://www.muirwoodteen.com.... Cannabis affects everyone differently, some users will experience very little negative effects, but there are plenty of people who will experience very negative effects caused by weed, such as, -Acute psychosis -Depersonalization/de-realization symptoms -Anxiety -Chronic psychosis -Schizophrenia -Depressive disorder -Mania symptoms -Suicidal behaviour -Depression Source for mental illnesses caused by long term smoking. https://en.wikipedia.org... Another source supporting effects of long term smoking. http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk... Source for link between cannabis and suicide. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk... It's clear that cannabis is not healthy for the brain. Other than some claim it makes them more confident, I fail to have found any positive affects for the brain caused by cannabis. With our brains being the most important organ in our entire body, why would we want to risk damaging it, and damaging the brains of our children? There are variables and differences between data and research done, such as the strain of cannabis they smoke, cannabis is a lot stronger now, than ever before and will continue to grow in strength, this renders past data for cannabis useless. Not enough research has been done on the long term affects of cannabis and the brain. With there being so little facts to suggest it is safe, why risk it? Don't let a drug that could cause life long brain dysfunction into our society. Instead campaign for more research. To conclude I would like you to read this link, where people who smoke weed have voiced their experiences about anxiety. Please read the comments, as it's proof that people are experiencing negative effects while and after smoking. http://www.socialanxietysupport.com...

S203a1bed-Afcef8dfb	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"Given that he has admittedly left many points unaddressed--argumentation ethics, the economic analysis, Section 2 of On Meth and Society, and others--I believe it's now impossible for Con to win this debate. Too many critical arguments have been dropped. Since Con has agreed to simply give a final acknowledgement in R4 (to make up for the R1 blunder), I won't extend these analyses. I'll simply redirect to my arguments in R3 to highlight the importance of dropped points, and will concentrate only on the ""Contract Analogy"". One point of clarificaton--Con comes from a viewpoint of ""common agreement"" whereby some contracts are considered legally impermissible, giving the example of ""slavery contracts"". Extend the argumentaton ethics analysis here, because A) contracts are voluntary agreements, in which case one cannot use legal action to control the contract without running into the problem of force and the dissipation of contract rights, and B) there is no such thing as a ""slavery contract"". The very notion of slavery is defined as involuntary servitude. That I am asking you to sign a contract binding you in lifelong service forces me to suppose free agency and the need for your consent. That I engage in negotiation demonstrates that you aren't a slave, and that it is logically impossible to bind you in ""voluntary involuntary servitude"". At the very heart of the contract analogy are the arguments about retrospective agency and opportunity cost. Though I may enter into a contract which severely compromises my future options (say, consenting to a major lobotomy), it does not follow that we should control such contracts by virtue of their nature. In the case of meth, the writing of the ""implicit contract"" is irrelevant (though I disagree that one is necessaily agreeing to addiction as much as agreeing to the risks). By using meth, individuals accept the opportunity costs in using their time and money for some other pursuit. Additionally, they accept the risks. By acting, people necessarily give up retrospective agency (i.e. the ability to look back on a bad decision and say ""But this isn't what I wanted!"") in nearly every conceivable case (though I'm sure exceptions can be found, like trying on clothes in a dressing room and deciding you want a different shirt. We could argue about how one cannot retrospectively change their decision to where they didn't try that shirt at all, but it's really neither here nor there). This is especially true of meth given the facts about its use as presented by Con. Regardless, Con doesn't make a compelling argument here where he simply reasserts that meth use is dangerous and harmful, thereby warranting legal action. He seems to take the position that this should be illegal by default, and that it is my burden to disprove this. ""Why"", he asks, should these self-regarding contracts be legal? Well, these answers have been given again and again throughout the debate. They have been dropped. What we are arguing is whether such contracts should be permissible--whether legislation regarding drugs should exist. After several rounds, Con's final strategy is simply to restate his initial thesis with no additional warrant or analysis. I've given reasons why self-harm should not be regulated (see: On Meth and Self-Harm), and why social problems resulting from meth can be dealt with in other ways (see: On Meth and Society). The social, political, ethical, and economic arguments all sway overwhelmingly in my favor. Checkmate, Con. Cheerio."	PRO	253
S8712369-A1b5d10d7	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	"To start off, I would like to point out that neither myself, or my opponent set up a specific style of debate in our private messages or in the comments. This meaning I am a little caught off guard to the fact that he mentioned he would save rebuttals to the arguments I made in round 3, whilst copy/pasting arguments from an old Euthanasia debate of his. While tactically, I do not see an advantage in doing this, I will go along with it and I suppose we can just ignore my arguments for now and focus on the points he brought up. It just might have been easier to just have let him start the debate if I knew in advance this would be the case. I apologize to the readers for our apparent lack of communication in this matter. First, I will address my opponent’s opener. He starts my making a medieval analogy from the use of guillotines to Euthanasia. This reference seems to be completely irrelevant, and out there. Not only have societal morals and ethics changed considerably from the time Guillotines were used, that also has nothing to do with Euthanasia. Several points throughout the debate, I think my opponent seems to confuse Euthanasia to that of the death penalty. The Guillotine’s use was for that of punishment, not generally relief from pain and suffering. Lannan then makes a reference towards Hitler’s creation of “Euthanasia”. At this point, I am coming to understand that my opponent may not know what Euthanasia actually is. Euthanasia was defined in the first round however, as being something completely different than killing an entire group of people in pursuit of one’s personal Agenda. What Hitler did was not Euthanasia, and to spin that as Euthanasia is not only inaccurate, but also manipulative. My opponent also draws a point from the movie “The Giver”. I could point out how incredulous the notion is that fictional society’s rules can have any influence towards our own realistic society. This is the equivalent of me saying the movie “Contagion” is a proper reference for the Pro Euthanasia standpoint. Rebuttal 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. Let’s forgive the fact that this whole argument encompasses statistics from Belgium and the Netherlands, and the debate is in the realm of the United States (a society with a completely different standard of laws, ethics, and morals). Euthanasia without consent of a fully functioning, mentally stable adult is not “Euthanasia”. Without the consent of the patient, or the patient’s caregivers, giving someone a lethal dose is murder. The murder statistics and the argument itself are thus irrelevant to this debate. My argument 3 actually addresses this point in advance however. A properly regulated legalization process would ensure specific measures are taken in regards to patient or caregiver consent, just as with my Oregon source. Rebuttal 2: The slippery slope argument As I mentioned above, it is hard to debate the morals of a different country. My opponent drawing references to children deaths, again is not Euthanasia. It has nothing to do with putting a patient out of his or her misery, and isn’t even closely related to the topic at hand. My opponents own argument provides several definitions that re-emphasize that Euthanasia is the killing of a dying patient. Using the slippery slope argument seems to work against his intentions, as the slippery slope fallacy often suggests that inaccurate presumptions are being made about a potential outcome of a rule or legislation, without any actual evidence that these things will happen. My opponent is drawing a very long line from painlessly killing people in hospitals, to murdering children for no apparent purpose. My opponent mentions how doctors may have a hard time with Euthanasia because they are used to healing rather than killing. Euthanasia should be looked at as a cure from suffering and pain. It is essentially healing a person of some of the worst pains possible. If a doctor has trouble with this, maybe he hasn’t been around enough open wounds to really be called a doctor. Doctor’s being scarred for life is a moot point. Patients should fear doctor's that go outside the realm of legality and choose to murder innocents, however that has nothing to do with Euthanasia. Lastly, in this point, my opponent offers statistics on doctor's preferences on physician assisted suicide. Many doctors probably don't want to commit assisted suicide, but I think that is far beside the point. In my opponents own source(3), A whopping 56.2% of doctors had received requests for assisted suicide during their career. After all, Euthanasia values should arguably focus around the patient, not the physician. The patients are the one's in excruciating pain after all. 53% of Physicians answered yes to the moral compass question asked to them, if they would have been okay with Euthanasia upon a patient requesting it. Rebuttal 3: Self ownership and Sickness Lannan brings up a point about how a patient who is in a vegetative state came out of it after 13 years. While I don't really think this falls under the category of extreme pain, I will address this point anyway. I am not really advocating for painless Euthanasia's as that is not covered in the definition, but if vegetative states were permanent it may be different. My opponent shows that it is easier with medical research the way it is these days to bring someone out of a coma. My response is: Great, more power to them! We don't need to Euthanize individuals who can probably come out of a coma. It may be up to the family at that point who paid for the 13 years of medical care for the vegetative person. But my arguments mostly apply to individuals that are more than likely for sure going to die. Next my opponent mentions that patients might not be of the right mind when they ask for Euthanasia. It's easy to forget sometimes that humans are animals too, though. We are instinctual, and the instinct and reaction to pain is the same throughout most species. When in pain, we want to not be in pain anymore. In fact in most circumstances, when in excruciating pain, the only thought that one will have is that they will do anything to let the pain end. Why is ending that pain a bad thing? Most sane, rational humans beings wouldn't want to sit and watch a cat or a dog suffer who had just been hit by a car. Is it more ethical to allow them to live in pain and misery because they cannot think clearly, or to do them the justice of putting them out of their misery? Will they ever be in the ""Right"" mind, when pain is always around the corner? How do we determine whether someone is in the ""right"" mind to begin with? This to me sounds like some narcissistic justification for someone to justify their stance on the moral realm of Euthanasia. Thinking for the patient doesn't mean that under different circumstances, they still wouldn't have wanted the pain to end via death. I actually found this line from my opponent quite humorous, as it works against him: ""This means that we must observe the weight of the individuals value to the community verse the needs of that individual."" What value does a terminally ill patient serve to their community? The value in their life has diminished to suffering, and misery. The spheal about Euthanasia robbing the community doesn't make much sense to me. We are robbing the community of an individual who will be susceptible passive Euthanasia no matter what, a person who is most likely bed ridden, and doesn't want to live anyway (whether they are in the ""right"" state of mind or not). To conclude, I think my opponent has a very different view of what Euthanasia actually is, than I do. If we are sticking straight to the definition (which I am), then half my opponents arguments don't even apply to this debate. Most of his objections to Euthanasia seems to be out of criminal intentions. I am not an advocater of criminal intent, and law breaking, so these points really serve no purpose in the debate. I wish my opponent luck in the following round. Sources: (3) http://euthanasia.procon.org..."	PRO	254
Sc351e266-A18bca64c	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"Thanks again to kasmic, really appreciated this stirring debate. What I'm going to do here is crystallize my arguments while providing some counter-rebuttal, going in order of importance through the arguments, and shoring up my arguments against Con's case. 1) Safety I think Con is misunderstanding much of this argument, and I think this becomes clear with his question. No, I'm not suggesting that no law should be enforced if its harmful. I'm saying that if the enforcement of a law does more harm than good, then the law should be removed. No one would argue, for example, that laws against murder do more harm than good, since they prevent countless deaths. I'm arguing that laws against prostitution do. Con grants all of the harms I've stated result from enforcement, so all of the points I made regarding the contribution of police to a lack of safety in prostitution flow straight through. More importantly, though, Con failed to address incarceration and its harms - PTSD, diminished self-worth, severe difficulties with reintegration into society, social withdrawal, interpersonal distrust, etc. - as well as the issue of reporting structures. If the legal system is actually standing in the way of protecting against illegal enslavement, trafficking and abuses of women, then that law is beyond flawed. But even where Con is responsive to my points, he's not doing anywhere near a complete job. Con fails to realize that those same problems (unreported rape and differences in perception) are the same across all studies of this nature (i.e. studies that compare rape rates between countries with legal and illegal prostitution). But even if that's reason to dismiss the point (and it would be reason to dismiss his [3] as well), he's ignoring my other sources [10, 11, 13-15] that also support the same point, many of which look directly at single cases. In either instance, my case is better supported by the data. Con does present a new argument here: that regulations are ineffective at preventing unprotected sex. Sadly for Con, this is just mitigation. What Con fails to recognize is that ""The decision and ability to use condoms is a complex one that depends on many factors.""Negotiating safer sex can be affected by money, if business is slow or clients offer more money for unprotected sex. Clients may use violence to enforce unsafe sex. Sex workers may use drugs before or with clients, which affects decision making and ability to use condoms. Sex workers may also be targeted by police if they are carrying condoms."" [38] My policy at least partially solves for all but the first of these, and yet all of them are major problems in status quo. And, since engaging in prostitution without protection would be against the law, clients will have to offer more money to overpower the legal concerns, excluding more instances of this occurring. I don't expect to solve for this problem completely, but I do solve better than status quo. The reality is that regulations, access to police resources, and legally-run businesses are likely to reduce instances of abuse. This isn't idealism "" I supported these arguments thoroughly in R2. That reduction in abuse and rape is very real, as is the reduction in the incidence and prevalence of STDs. Con never challenged those sources, nor the logic behind their relevance. 2) Justice Tossing this argument callously aside is a big mistake. Con has not addressed any of the logic of this argument, dropping the warrants and impacts completely. The dehumanization argument I gave there is reason enough to vote Con, since this is a pervasive problem that affects 1% (1.5 million) of the female population in the U.S. Instead, he asserts that my source says prostitution is a type of slavery. I can't find that anywhere in my sources, and his link doesn't work, so I can't check where he's getting it from. But even if it's true, the idea that prostitution is a form of slavery is absurd in a legal system. These women are entering into it of their own free will and they have the capacity to leave. Neither of those things are true in the status quo. If prostitution is slavery, that's only in the illegal system that Con's endorsing. Yet another reason to vote Pro. 3) Costs Con just grants these arguments, and says they're not significant enough to change policy. I disagree. Practically ending human trafficking and thus the kidnapping and enslavement of women is not a small impact. Providing improved access to better education and health care systems systems and rehabilitation means is no small impact. Con is so concerned with the plight of these women, yet he seeks to close off a route to health, safety, and self improvement that would grant them the capacity to take up other jobs. Yes, this is reason enough by itself to vote for the proposal. With that, I'll get back to the main points brought forth by my opponent. States Rights 1) Feel free to look over his counter rebuttal here and his original point back in R2. Nowhere does he state any harms that result from ""undermin[ing] States rights"". He agrees that the federal government CAN do this, and so his entire argument is reliant on showcasing the harms of their taking this action, and yet he has completely failed to do so. He hasn't explained why these rights are important to any degree, or why, if they are important, this particular undermining does great harm to them. Con has placed no impact on this argument whatsoever. So even if you're buying that there's a negative effect to state's rights, there's nothing here to pick Con up on. 2) Con's missing the point here. If the people should have the power to choose, then prostitution should be legal. Keeping it illegal refuses them the right to that choice. So even if Con's right and the tenth amendment is paramount, there's a 50/50 chance that it supports my view. 3) Con is basically not responsive to this point. I showed through a case analysis of California's legalization of marijuana that the USSC can and does prefer national law to the state law when it comes to commerce. Last I checked, prostitution was a business. Prostitutes do cross state lines, so there's an effect on interstate commerce, something Con concedes the federal government retains control over. 4) (sorry, just realized this was mislabeled as 5)) Con drops this. The fact that international law supersedes national law is enough to turn this point in my favor. The U.S. must follow basic humanitarian laws, which far outstrip some minimal issue of states rights. Other thoughts Is Con really suggesting that we should consider making coal mining, oil rig work, nursing staff, and numerous other positions illegal? A reasonable reason, from my perspective, to outlaw a type of job is to assess its impact on those who do not consent to be a part of it, even when it's placed under substantial regulation. Prostitution doesn't meet that threshold. Con brings an infinite regression argument into the mix, arguing that my argument could be used to legitimize acting on pedophilia. I would beg to differ. Children cannot consent, ergo they do meet my threshold for illegality. The fact that Con agrees with my sentiment that this is a problem we cannot ignore, and yet makes no effort to solve for it, is an important aspect of this debate. Let's be clear that Con has only run a negative case throughout this debate. He has furnished 0 evidence and made no arguments for the status quo or even for keeping prostitution illegal. He hasn't shown that the status quo has solved, even partially, for any of the harms I've presented. Running an entirely negative case has its benefits, but this is a huge problem when most of my evidence and practically all of his showcases harms to the status quo. These are guaranteed to persist in Con's world. Only mine solves for any portion of those concerns. Conclusions: The major reason voters should be siding with me in this debate is that I'm the only one with any solid offense on the table. The only offense Con presents is this states rights issue, but since it never gets any impacts, since it's unclear and uncertain, since there's precedent agaisnt it, and since the justice point overwhelms it, this argument just goes nowhere. The rest of Con's points have all been mitigation, and none of that has been all-encompassing. He practically ignores my costs and justice points, both of which are substantial arguments in favor of the resolution. Con cannot simply dismiss them by asserting that they are unimportant without addressing my impacts. So even if Con somehow mitigated my safety point into oblivion, it's not enough to win him the debate. But he hasn't done that either. All of his responses simply showcase that legalization doesn't solve completely for every harm that prostitutes face today. But absolute solvency is unnecessary for me to win this debate. I'm the only one who's directly compared status quo to my plan, showcasing that legalization substantially improves on the situation for these women and their clients. Any positive impact here, which affects the basic safety of these women, is enough to vote Pro on this alone. Taken together, my case presents numerous advantages that remain mostly uncontested. We all recognize that the current system is untenable, partially as a result of enforcement itself being harmful, and as such, we must take an action that would ensure that those harms are minimized. That means removing the harmful enforcment, and allowing regulation to solve for many of the problems thatillegality cannot. My case accomplishes these goals. Con's support of status quo entrenches these harms. Vote Pro. 38. http://caps.ucsf.edu... (Yes! There's only one this round!)"	PRO	255

S1b53d7af-Af31fd1cd	Recreational Drugs should be Legalized	"Likewise, Hempforvictory, I am honored to debate someone with your abilities. I deduce from your handle, your choice of presidentiial candidate, and your choice of sources, that your interests are more related to your personal preferences than a desire to rid society of the drug scurge. By contrast, even though I drink alcohol, my only concern is for those who misuse drugs, thse who eventually will, and the rest of society who must endure the problems they create. Because of my positions, I would willingly give up my cosumption of alcohol if we could effectively ban its use. The difference between attempting to ban alcohol and maintaining a ban on drugs is based on numbers. There are over 130 million alcohol users compared to less than 30 million drug users. Tobacco will, ultimately, go away on its own, but right now would be better. Further, comparing drug use favorably to alcohol and tobacco use is upside-down. I beleve the more consistant view would be: alcohol and tobacco as well as all other dangerous and debilitating drugs should be outlawed. Do you beleive that children should be free to obtain drugs? If so, I refuse to continue the debate. If not, can you see my concern that drug dealers would be left with only children to sell to. That is, if legalization did actually cause adults to eschew illegal sources. It is an estalished fact of economics that organizations will produce a good so long as the marginal cost is less than the marginal price. This means that the same students who sell and buy drugs in school will continue to be able to do so. Additionally, any presently existing taboos that prevent the saner individuals from participaiing will disappear when children are told by their associates that ""...it is ok! Even the goverment says that it is."" Ron Paul's retort woould involve education. Education is expensive. Who pays? I do. Oh, R.P. might say that taxes on drugs would pay for education and treatment, but that drives up the cost of the drugs, and creates a profit margin for the dealers. It is a fantacy, that drug dearlers would go away with dug legalization. They will proliferate in a society that tolerates drugs. BTW: You are not a conservative. Your profile suggests some conservative positions - mainly economic. But in the social arena you are decidedly overwhelmingly liberal."	CON	257
S9cf510cd-A5f999bbf	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"Me and con discussed the rules for the last round. ""We can do rebuttals, so long as we don't make new points in them."" This means I may only make Rebuttals, and not making additional Contentions and Arguments. As for not being able to refute dropped cases, that wasn't in the argreement. I may refute any case made. I'll only refute cases brought out in R4 (including the Mitochrondria argument.) I gave two straight definitions from three dictionaries. One was the definition, the other was the legal definition. I only used those two usages, same meaning, difference only in who recognizes it (the dictionary, or the government.) My definitions were set a head of time, and Con rudely disregarded them, instead changing the requirement of personhood to meet his needs. Rebuttal I: The Rape Exception. The UDHR has vast legal influence in the US. While the UN can not punish a nation for ignoring the document, to ignore it is still a human rights violation. That's where the question comes in. Should the US do it if it is a humans right violation: short answer, no. Going against the basic rights in the UDHR is still a human rights violation, even if the UN can't punish you (although they have punished places before.) The US ratified the UDHR, meaning the US recognizes those rights, and that breaking them is still a human rights violation. Rape is completely irrelevant to whether or not abortion is right. It's completely irrelevant to the case all together. How the fetus is conceived isn't important. Only an attempt to make others feel for Con's case. Being unhappy with how someone was born is not an excuse to end their life. Only two people are involved in rape... The rapist and the victim. The fetus is absolutely not involved in the scenario. Thompson's analogy is a faulty analogy. The baby is not the violinist. The rapist is. The baby didn't violate the woman. She may seek to separate herself for the baby after birth, but not kill it before birth. The analogy is blaming the wrong person, and is a terrible rendering of the situation that gravely misinterprets it beyond recognition. Sub-point A: Con claims my case is inhumane. Con is again misrepresenting my entire case. Forcing someone to save a life is wrong, but forcing someone to not kill a person isn't. If someone is being killed, you don't have to save them, but when you are the one killing them (or having them killed), it changes. Sub-point B: The fetus is a body all it's own. The fetus will have its own bodily integrity separate of the mothers. To ignore the fetus' right would be to ignore many of his rights. Con has failed to prove that ignoring the fetus's right to bodily integrity would be less of a violation. Ignoring the mother's right would violate her Bodily Integrity, while ignoring the fetus' would violate his Bodily Integrity, and Right to Life. Violating the fetus' would be a much more grave violation. Clashing rights are always a sensitive topic, but in this case, the Fetus loses out most if ignored. Rebuttal II: Saving the Mother's life Key-point... Many things are illegal because the misuse of them would be more grave than the benefits if legal. “Today it is possible for almost any patient to be brought through pregnancy alive, unless she suffers from a fatal illness such as cancer or leukemia, and, if so, abortion would be unlikely to prolong, much less save, life.” – Dr. Alan Guttmacher of Planned Parenthood. While not every live can be saved without Abortion, the number that actually require abortion without any other option is microscopic. This is a case of having a bad option (abortion) and a good option (proper medical attention) and picking the bad option. The law specifically states that if there is a way preserve life without killing, it must be taken. Killing in self defense must only be the last resort. Con might bring up that medical attention costs more money, but following the law is never cheaper. Just because something costs less doesn't mean it should be legal. So why then shouldn't abortion be legal for the mothers who truly do require it to live but the child's doesn't? Legalizing it would cause more misuse than benefits. The number of people saved wouldn't increase, while the number of death from misuse of the broad exception gravely outnumbers it. Women who didn't actually need abortion would still wrongly get them because of the broad definition of ""self-defense."" A similar case of this happening is the vast misuse of legalized Marijuana. The biggest reason why making Mother only abortions legal will lead to more causalities is this. Legal or illegal, one person dies each case. But wen illegal, only those few die. If legal, the same number dies, plus a death count from misused cases. Making cases where mother and child is at risk illegal leaves two causalities each case. Since the requirements are that both are dying, it'll be harder to wrongly claim one. Making those abortions legal will actually save somebody. The difference is the ratio of lives saved compared to the ratio of lives wrongfully lost in the misuse of the legalization. This is always taken into consideration when legalizing something or keeping something legal. When something wrong is done while illegal, it's the person's fault, but when done while legal, it's on the Governments shoulders. Rebuttal III: Abortion in General Sub-point A: Con has continuously spent his time making false analogies. A fingernail isn't a human because its DNA isn't unique from its host. The host is human, the fingernail is only an add on. A mitochondria is also not comparable, as the mitochondria is grown as a part of the plant cell, and is not it's own cell. It is also only an addition. Although there are exceptions, like the Virus, con never begin to prove the fetus is one. A fetus actually starts as a cell. A mitochondria isn't a cell, or any form of organism, and is only an addition. The fetus is fully unique and matches all the characteristics of a unicellular organism from conception. Con's comparisons are not accurate in the least. I said that a human corpse is still human, which is why it has bodily integrity even through it isn't alive anymore. My full quote can be found in R3, Rebuttal III. ""C: Even a corpse is human (i.e. Human Corpse.) Ones humanity stays after death. This is why they cannot use your body parts without your permission after you die. For the sake of debate, I've fully explained how a fetus is alive."" Pro in R3 I do not understand how Con came to this conclusion that I said a corpse is not a human. Con lied about my own argument, and claims I made an argument I never claimed. I said quite the opposite of that, and my argument do not contradict. Con's do, however. ""C. Finally, a human implies that someone possess the full-range of capacities that make them alive. A corpse is not a human, it was a human."" -Con in R2. Con made the claim that a corpse is no longer human, and now he is claiming they are. He has contradicted his own argument, lied about mine, and made a claim that further proves my actual argument. Sub-point B: While a few nations, like Canada and the UK, are similar to the US, most nations aren't. You can't compare the US to most the world. Nations in Asia, East Europe, and Africa fit con's reference, but are nothing like the US. Most, if not all, nations that have large rates of illegal abortions also have, a) poor police efficiency, b) much higher pregnancy rate than the US. Some nations with high illegal abortion rates also have twice the pregnancy rate, and c) more poverty facing women. Rebuttal IV: Cross-Application My logic abides to the accepted form of Human Rights. While the UN can not enforce the UDHR, the US has signed it, acknowledging those as human rights. To violate them is to violate the US-accepted Human Rights. Con has missed the very reason I brought up the UDHR. It's an accepted list of rights that each nation, specifically the US, follow. Just because it can't be enforced deosn't mean you aren't violating human rights by ignoring a right explained in it. You very much are. My personhood rationale was the actual part of the court decision on Roe v Wade. The court specifically claimed that their decision only stands if the fetus is not a person. The fetus is human, making it a person. That is the legal definition of person: A human being (4). Being alive isn't even required, much like how a corpse's body can not be violated even though it isn't alive. This wasn't my rationale, but the official Federal Court decision. My ""rationale"" that a fetus is a person was based solely on hard science and biology. 4) http://tinyurl.com... Conclusion: Most of con's arguments are fallacies and misrepresentation of my arguments. Con ignored my offical definitions of Person in order to replace it with his own. Con lied about my argument regarding the corpse, and contradicted his own argument. Con made false analogies and comparisons. The legal definition of Person is human. Nothing more. A) A fetus has unique human DNA. B) A fetus is human. C) A fetus is a person Since a fetus is human, it is guaranteed right to life by the 14th Amendment, as is the offical decision of the court. Abortion is then the killing of a human, makig it homicide, which is only legal as a last resort self-defense. However, the benefits of legalizing Abortion in cases where only the mother is at risk is gravely outmatch by negative use. Since legal or illegal, the same number of people are saved, while more would die in misuse of the broad legalization. While the number saved in the more numerious cases where both are at risk would outmatch the losses of life from misuses (since it'll be harder to wrongly get one with a less broad legalization.) Unless both mother and child are at risk, Abortion should be illegal. Keeping it legal for cases where only the mother dies will have a larger causalty rate then if made illegal. Any other exemptions does not legally justify the violation of the unborn's rights."	PRO	258
S42f970a3-A426ed275	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"Food comparison: Two wrongs do not make a right. Just because people can eat themselves to an early death doesn't mean they should also be allowed to smoke themselves to an early death. The same logic would require us to legalize all hard drugs. People can make their own decisions regarding heroin. However, legalizing it would seem to sanction its use, make it more easily accessible, and allow companies to advertise that doing heroin is a desirable lifestyle choice. Cigarette use is much more widespread than it should be due to positive advertising from the cigarette companies that reach children (but do not necessarily ""target"" them). Eating cannot be criminalized, since there isn't a clear brightline between what fat or sugar content is considered healthy and what in considered unhealthy. It depends on the expert who is studying the issue and the metabolism of the individual eating the food. In contrast, cigarettes are all unambiguously unhealthy. However, I would argue that marketing fatty foods to children using fun characters like Ronald McDonald should be illegal, which answers your objections. In addition, Jamie Oliver on Food Revolution explains that fast food is okay when eaten in moderation, such as once a month. Oliver, in spite of his healthy eating credentials, admits to taking his children to fast food restaurants once a month. So eating McDonald's once a month is not incompatible with a healthy lifestyle. In fact, most children who become obese do so because of the food they choose to eat at home and the foods they pick at their school cafeteria (in addition to a lack of exercise), not because of fast food visits. Because obesity is not directly correlated to fast food, banning fast food would do very little. However, banning cigarettes would directly correlate to fewer smoking-related deaths and illnesses. Ingesting a quarter-pounder with cheese is not quite the same as sucking poison and tar into your lungs. Only one of those actions can be mitigated with daily exercise. Also, keep in mind that quitting fast food will not give you withdrawal symptoms. Cigarettes contain an addictive drug (nicotine) that the government should have the right to regulate/ban. Health care: Yes, a very small number of plans cover abortions. However, abortions do not raise the cost of health care for everyone in the nation by $75 billion a year. Marketing to kids: When every single cigarette advertisement that is viewed by a child increases the child's chance of smoking by 182%, you have to admit there is a serious problem. Our psychologies are complicated regarding advertising, especially when we are children. The ""choice"" that you keep falling back on is not as simple as weighing the pros and cons and making a rational decision of whether or not to smoke. The choice: It is society's job to adjudicate competing rights claims. Cigarette smokers have the right to smoke. Non-cigarette smokers have the right not to be forcibly exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay the hidden health care costs for smokers. It is now society's job to decide whose rights should supersede the other group's rights. Nicotine is an addictive drug, the only recreational addictive drug that is legal. Although fast food and alcohol have some addictive properties, quitting either of them will not give you withdrawal symptoms. If we can remove a choice to do other addictive drugs like heroin, why can we not do so with nicotine? We recognize in our society that addiction is not truly a choice. I'd like to note that at the end of the day, my opponent has no response to the fact that the hidden productivity and health care costs mean that non-smokers have to pay $7.18 for each pack of cigarettes that a smoker purchases. This unfair economic burden is why cigarettes should be banned. Prohibition: Cigarettes (today) are not analogous to alcohol (during the Prohibition Era). CBS News says in 2006 that: 71% of Americans drink alcohol regularly. [1] Prohibition obviously was going to fail when 7 of 10 Americans consumed the substance regularly. In contrast, many fewer people smoke cigarettes, approximately 20%. [2] In addition, the 7 of 10 Americans who drink alcohol mostly do not want to quit. Most of them drink socially and in moderation, which studies show can actually be healthy (riboflavin in red wine helps heart health). In contrast, most smokers actually want to quit because they know cigarettes harm their health, but they feel hooked. A Gallup poll in 2005 found that ""more than three out of four smokers want to kick the smoking habit."" [3] A ban would help motivate those 3 out of 4 smokers to quit. Obviously, since most smokers actually want to quit, there would not be the same backlash that there was during Prohibition. Economic benefits of smoking: First, keep in mind that a smoking ban in the United States would not necessarily force farmers to stop growing tobacco. Farmers could theoretically be allowed to sell the tobacco to companies that don't make cigarettes (nicotine gum companies for example) or could sell the tobacco to other countries where cigarettes are still legal. In addition, the $2 billion added to the economy from smoking is completely outweighed by the $157 billion lost every single year from the economy from smoking due to lost productivity and higher health care costs. Right to smoke: Remember from before that others have the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay higher health care premiums. Society must decide whose rights are more important. In addition, people may have the right to do heroin, that doesn't mean that we should allow them to do so. Maybe people should also have the ""right"" to have a consensual sexual relationship with a child. Our moral repugnance to this example shows two things: 1) children cannot make fully informed decisions, which proves my advertising point (remember 9 out of 10 smokers start smoking as children) and 2) that we should pass laws that maximize the benefits for all society when rights are in conflict (an adult's right to have a sexual relationship vs. a parent's right to protect their child). In summary, ban smoking because it is not really a choice – most people choose to smoke as children because they are inundated with advertising convincing them to do so. 3 out of 4 of them later in life would like to quit, but feel like they cannot; a ban would help them quit. Smoking is unfair because it impedes on the rights of non-smokers. Non-smokers have the right to a smoke free environment that does not endanger their health or the lives of their children. Non-smokers also have the right not to have to pay for the costs of smoking. Remember, each $5 pack of cigarettes costs society an additional $7.18 in hidden costs. [1] http://www.cbsnews.com...

S8712369-A684456ec	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	"I thank my opponent for debating me here today. For this round I shall only provide my opening arguments as my rebuttals will be in my next round. Libertarian Grim Dark Framework Throughout history people have been inspired to make inventions to help the masses and progress soceity. Though the sad fact is tha the government hasn't always used these inventions to the best of their use in order to help people. The Guillotine being one of the greatest examples of a doctor creating an invention for a more humane way for prisoner executions. He had no idea that the Revolutionaries would use this to execute thousands in the Reign of Terror. He had no idea that France would use this to silence their political opposition. Peter Jensen has seen his invention of the loud speaker to turn into a massive invasion of privacy and brainwashing as Hitler took the project and changed it to how he saw fit. Euthanasia. Even though there's a good intention behind the practice history has shown that if you give the government the power of the invention via legalization that it will be used for the wrong reason. Many great authors have already begun to forecast this. The best example is that of ""The Giver"" where the weak are killed off via infantcide and the old are euthanized. There is already a beginning of a mounting support for the practice of eugenics and if this becomes legalized then it will enlarge the government and allow them to infrindge on the rights of their citizens and even take their lives. In this debate I will show why it shouldn't be legalized as we are already seeing this fall from grace and it is our job of this generation to halt this trampling of our rights before we give the government another weapon like the Guillotine or even the Dark Net. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. I shall begin by giving you the horrible statistics of Euthanasia. [1] Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent. [2] A study in Belgium reported that 32% were without consent. Contention 2: The Slippery Slope Argument Keown gives in his slippery slope argument of 2002, that once one form of euthanasia is accepted that other forms, like involuntary euthanasia, to become legal. For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, “If there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.” However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. [3] .) There 2001 law also permitted children from age 12-16 to be euthanized with parental concent! Though the nation does not consider the child at liberty to make the call. [4] The euthanasia’s in Belgium have doubled since 1998. The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia’s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition. """"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?"" From a pre-1950 dictionary: ""Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain."" From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): ""1. An easy death or means of inducing one. 2. The act or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable conditions or diseases."" From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (1981): ""1. Dying easily, quietly and painlessly. 2. The act of willfully ending life in individuals with an incurable disease"" [5] You are also given the healing doctor a killing roll. This can have a huge effect on doctors as it was proved that it has an effect on doctors who are supposed to heal their patients and are now asked to kill. This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. [6] We can also see that doctors themselves oppose euthanasia. Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]:42% Had both a ""religious and nonreligious objection"" to physician-assisted suicide31% Had ""no objection"" to physician-assisted suicide21% Had a ""nonreligious objection"" to physician-assisted suicide5% Had a ""religious objection"" to physician-assisted suicidePhysician Characteristics: 79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicidePhysicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South[7] and [8] Contention 3: Self Ownership and Sickness Consent from a palliative specialist is also very important, but recent euthanasia’s have not been doing so and consenting them. In Belgium, before 2002, all euthanasia cases without concent of a palliative specialist were denied, but from 2002-2007, that number declined from 100% to only 9% as only 19% of all euthanasia cases was a palliative contacted for their opinion. (Same source as the first one used in this round) Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. [9] For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. [10] Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, ""“it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.” [11] This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society. Due to me running out of characters my sources will be presented in the comments section."	CON	261
S9cf510cd-A2ac0a2b7	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"Revive DDO Tournament: Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both the mother and child's life is endanger. Round One: Presentation of cases. No rebuttals. Rounds Two - Three: Rebuttals Round Four: No new arguments or responses. Side: Con ------------- I will address the resolutional framework and then present my case. Thanks to DK and to Subutai for making this round possible. DEFINITIONS Should - indicates desirablility. For example, if i were to say ""you should take out the trash,"" I am expressing what is desirable. Except - indicates an exlusion. For example, if I were to say ""take out those bags except the blue one,"" I am saying that the blue one is excluded from ""those bags."" Abortion - Is externally induced termination of the pregnancy designed to result in the destruction of the embryo or fetus. Also, since Pro offers several definitions of ""Person,"" it may become confusing as to what it means, so I would like to present a competing, straightforward explanation of my own: 1. Persons are human. I think it is a stretch to try to apply rights of personhood to corportations; i.e., no corporation would ever have an abortion so it is pointless to discuss the potential for a corporation to have a right to this. 2. Persons are living. A corpse is human, but clearly it is pointless to grant it rights under the personhood rationale. It has no autonomy, no ability to feel pain or pleasure, therefore we cannot talk fruitfully about the corpse's rights as a person because it does not need protection against infringements of its personhood such as violations of free will or bodily integrity. 3. Therefore, persons are living humans. FRAMEWORK The resolution poses a relatively clear question to begin with: should abortion be illegal. However, the second half of the topic imposes an important qualification: ""except when both the mother and child's lives are endangered."" This qualification is crucial insofar as it says ""both"" the mother and fetus's lives must be imperiled. If only one of their lives are in jeopardy, it would still be illegal to abort within Pro's world. Thus, Pro has the burden to show that abortion should be ILLEGAL in all situations other than the explicity stated exception. In other words, Pro must argue that such things as the ""Rape Exception"" are illegal, and that abortion should remain illegal even when only the mother's life or only the fetus's life is in danger. Con--I--have the burden of showing that abortion should be LEGAL in, at the very least, more cases than that one exception. In other words, all that I need to do to negate the resolution is to provide one more addtional exception in which abortion will be allowed. Of course, I will attempt to do more than that, but that is the minimum I have to do to win. Final note about the topic: this is not a resolution about rights. I don't have to show a right to abort, all I have to show is that abortion should be legal in more cases than that one exception. CON's CASE Now that I am done with my lenghty lead-in, I will construct my arguments. I will offer several contentions that are independant of one another--showing various additional exceptions to the resolution that should be permitted. Any one of these is sufficient to negate. I will conclude with a final argument about why abortion, in general as opposed to in specific cases, should be legal. Contention One: The Rape Exception Judith Thompson, in her famous essay, ""A Defense of Abortion,"" uses the following analogy in her argument: ""You wake up in bed one morning and find yourself next to an unconcious violinist...He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassaed all the avalible medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you and plugged his circulatory system into yours so that your kidneys can filter blood for both of you. You call the doctor and he tells you how sorry he is that you were kidnapped. He tells you that in 9 months they will have what they need to heal the violinist, but if you choose to unplug before then, the violinist will die."" Sure, it would be nice if you remained hooked up to the violinist, but should the law compel you to be so? In the foregoing example, you were forced into an outrageous position whereby your person has been egregiously invaded. You should have the choice to unplug yourself from the violinist. I will present two reasons why this is so: Sub-point A: The State cannot justifiable compel you to save someone. The State cannot compel you to give organs, to donate blood, to fly across the country to perform a surgery, etc. Your ability to excersize your autonomy in these matters outwieghs, legally, the right of the person in need. So, from a legal perspective, the mother can choose simply to ""not save"" the fetus. In the first 9 weeks for instance, she is not killing it directly, but by aborting it she does deprive it of what it needs to live, just as someone who refuses to give organs is depriving the person in need of a transplant of what they need to live. This is the case when discussing the abortion pill, which resembles an ""early miscarriage"" except that it is medically induced. [1] If we wish to use another of Thomson's examples to clarify the point, let us use this one (it's a bit updated though; Thomson originally use Henry Fonda): You are ill. The only way you can be cured is if Matt Bomer (or Kim Kardashian if you prefer) kisses your fevered brow. Can the government compel Bomer or Kardashian to fly across the country to come and kiss your fevered brow? Can your friends travel to wherever they live, kidnap them, bring them to you, and force them to kiss your fevered brow? No, obviously not. At this point, we concede that you cannot be compelled to give people what they need to live, and that this is different from murder or like offenses. Sub-point B: The Mother has the right to choose what happens to her body. Why is that your sovereignty over your body is suddenly curtailed by the fact that someone else might die? The law, in Roe v. Wade, asserted that you have a right to privacy, and you cannot get more private than what lies underneath your skin. The UDHR grants you a right to bodily integrity as well [2]. What if the doctor came back and said, ""Oh, I misspoke. You need to be connect 19 years, not 9 months."" Surely, you could diconnect yourself from the violinist at some point before those 19 years were up. The law cannot ask or compel you to live with such an invasion of privacy and bodily integrity for that length of time--it is an unreasonable violation of your rights. If we grant that, then by what rationale can we deny that you have the right to disconnect from the violinist before 9 months? Yes, it is a shorter timespan, but if time is the deciding factor, then where do we draw then line--after how long can you disconnect? If that question cannot be answered fairly and non-arbitrarily, then we must either (1) permit you to disconnect at any time, or (2) deny that you have any right to disconnect at all, which seems, on face, extreme. Then, if we accept (1) as our answer, we must also permit the analgous situation of abortion in cases of rape. Contention Two: Saving the Mother's Life We have here two competing rights--the right of the Mother to live, and the right of the fetus to ""live."" The question in this case is what are the range of options open to the mother in this instance. I think it is a bit ridiculous to suggest that a mother must sit passively by knowing that she will die if she does not abort but is unable to do so. Thomas provides yet another example to expound on this dilemma: There is a child in a home that is growing at a rapid pace. Soon he will become so huge that he will push the parents against the walls of the home and so crush them to death. The mother cannot get to the door, but she can use a needle to poke the child and deflate him, but doing so will kill the child. Must she simply let herself be crushed to death? No--the mother can exercise a right to self-defense and can deflate the child. As Thomson writes, ""In our case there are only two people involved: one whose life is threatened and one who threatens it...a woman surely can defend herself against the threat posed to her by the unborn child, even if doing so involves the death of the child."" Contention Three: Abortion, in general, should be legal. Sub-point A: The fetus is not ""alive"" in its own right; more so it is simply part of the mother's body because it users her body's functions. The most obvious reason for this claim is the the fetus is dependant on a single human in a parasitic relationship. Human beings are independantly functioning, yet a fetus is not. Some might make the counterclaim that, ""born human beings can be entirely dependent on other people too, but the crucial difference is that they are not dependent on one, specific person to the exclusion of all others."" [3] Another key point is that a fetus resides in side someone, which is not the cases with humans who live as individuals. The fetus is also incapable of acquring nutrients on it own, unable of disposing of waste on its own, unable of maintaing homeostasis on its own, and it cannot respirate on its own. Sub-point B: Illegal abortions are dangers to the public health Unsfae abortions are incredibly dangerous [4] and, if there are few safe, legal facilities with expert staff to perform them, the incidents of unsfa abortions will rise. The government therefore has a vested interest in keep abortion legal.

S8bb4c1ee-A96743f62	Cigarettes should be legal while cannabis should be illegal	"Thank you, for you response, those are some good points you've put across and a quite and daunting challenge you've given me which i'll gladly accept. You said and I quote "" I choose to value the lives of thousands of people over the farming business of thousands of farmers."" My argument's objective is to justify my case why the state of legality of the two drugs should stay as they are. Cannabis illegal and Cigarettes legal. Your response touched on why its very beneficial for those especially around cigarette smokers to be moved away from harm, that was valid and you also spoke about why it would be problem to illegalize cigarettes due to conflict between government and those that feel they have a right. If that's the case then its justifiable for cigarettes to stay legal, although their state of legality has brought so many deaths throughout the world. If we look at it from a neutral position then its best we illegalize both drugs but if we look at it from an intellectual view then we'll realize that we cant change what has been been done. We cant bring back the lives safely but one thing we have to come to terms with is how Cigarettes have "" May be hazardous to health' written clearly in bold white lettering, this shows how the manufactures understand how people need the Nicotine but it warns them meaning that the decision for people to go to the grave or to acquire diseases associated with smoking plays a role on the number of deaths and so we cant illegalize it due to health factors when people clearly make an informed decision. Illegalizing Cigarettes will cause a lot of problems for a lot of lives, mainly those that Con clearly values and those are the number of farmers that are in the Tobacco business, not only are they just farmers and Con perceives them but these are Thousands of farmers in continents but not only does a farmer represent his Tobacco but also his staff of hundreds or even thousands depending on the size of his/her farm, especially those farmers on African soil that provide not only money as a salary but a means to preserve and look after large families in places where there is shortage of food due to corruption in governments. (which isn't their fault ) Lets think of the poverty that could come forth from the taking away of Cigarette production. To take away a family of 7 or 8 the only way to buy food and other basic necessities and not luxuries but basic necessities like taking their children to school and to give them a roof over their head. THAT IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE Sir. To conclude I ask you to be open minded as to the consequences of illegalizing Cigarettes which out whey the benefits which although could save many lives but also could devastate the lives of many people. Because in no way are they disadvantaged on the basis that there is no clear warnings. I propose we find an alternative way to pump Nicotine which I the addictive drug into the bodies of those addicted because its not the nicotine that gives cancer but 200 substances out of 4000 found in cigarettes that give cancer.

S255646d7-Aef45b4e	There should not be any type of ban on Abortion	"dxpilot made some good points, but there are several flaws in his responses. ""1.) shouldnt the father have a say in the abortion of the child?"" Most abortions that happen are because the father isn't there. It usually occurs in rape victims. ""2.)wouldnt you be mad if you were killed for just growing and doing nothing and out of nowhere, something just comes up and sucks up your limbs? i would"" Sorry, but I don't think you would. Fetus' cannot feel pain, or for that matter, emotions while they're in the womb. ""but even if you experience a bad experience, it isnt the childs fault. and if you believe that the child is to blame, you can still give it a chance to grow in a fauster house."" For some, if the child is a result of a bad experience, the fetus would only serve as a painful reminder for the mother. Some women could possibly be afraid of giving birth. To those who aren't, kudos to them. But for those who are, a safe abortion should be available to them, because the Bill of Rights entitles every US Citizen to the ""Highest standard of health"". And another reason why abortions should not be limited or banned; What if an ultrasound test shows that the fetus were to be born with some kind of disease that would make life for the child very painful and short?

S42f970a3-A85e6cb49	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"I thank my opponent for his timely response. ~Refutations~ 1. Smoking hurts our economy Subpoint A: productivity I grant my opponent that cigarettes are unhealthy, but if everything that is unhealthy and unproductive should be made illegal, the government would have to criminalize a lot more than just cigarettes under the same criteria, such as junk food and fast foods. Obesity is becoming a national problem. [1] Subpoint B: health care costs We all pay for the expenses of having certain rights and privileges, though not all might agree with those rights. Similarly, while cigarettes can affect the cost of health care, that doesn't mean that right shouldn't exist. The health care also covers Abortions, and those who may not agree with Abortions pay for a health care program that does. Furthermore, there are always going to be things that will harm humans, both voluntary and involuntary, which is what necessitates the health care in the first place. The cost of health care shouldn't be the reason to criminalize a certain right and freedom. 2. Lives This argument can be applied to fast food, which poses a major threat to our nation. ""Although most of the health problems related to fast food aren't felt until middle age -- obesity and diabetes are at an all-time high --- the damage starts before children enter kindergarten. Hoping to shape eating habits, fast-food chains market heavily to children. About 96% of American school-aged children recognize Ronald McDonald, second only to Santa Claus. Almost every American child eats at a McDonald'sï¿½ at least once a month."" [2] Fast food markets to both children and adults, and their products start to damage the agent before they enter kindergarten. Should fast food be made illegal too? 3. Marketing (to kids) Because cigarette companies market their products to children, it should be illegal for those who are old enough to smoke? There is already a ban on advertising cigarettes. Cigarette companies that do market to kids are doing something that is already illegal. Teenagers are impressionable and reckless and will do what they want, regardless of what the law states. Making cigarettes illegal because it markets to kids is unreasonable. ~Arguments~ ~Prohibition Era~ My first counter argument is the Prohibition Era of 1920. The endeavor to ban alcohol ended in disaster, as crime rates skyrocketed and ""While Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor consumed, it tended to destroy society by other means, as it stimulated the proliferation of rampant underground, organized and widespread criminal activity."" [3] A ban on cigarettes would only trigger another facsimile of the Prohibition of 1920. ~Loss of Revenue and Jobs~ Cigarettes also attribute to great economic opportunities, as well as jobs. ""California's smokers, who comprise only 17.2 percent of the state's population, paid more than $2.2 billion in cigarette-related revenue to the state in 2001. That's more than $6 million a day, or nearly $4,200 per minute."" [4] ""In 1999, 2000 and 2001, smokers nationwide paid $88 billion in cigarette revenues."" [4] American Cigarettes are also a popular import to other countries, which encourages trade and helps the economy. [5] Criminalizing cigarettes also will cause further unemployment, and millions of those who work for tobacco companies will lose their jobs, as well as farmers who grow tobacco. ~The Right to Smoke~ As adults, I believe we have to deal with the consequences of our actions and choices; even if the result of smoking cigarettes causes a user to die. http://www.helium.com...

S42f970a3-A5933301	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"Food comparison: My opponent advocates a healthy life, I advocate a life where one can choose between a healthy and unhealthy life. My opponent's objections to cigarettes being illegal are that it is unhealthy, but why do we necessary have to live healthy lives? The meaning of life varies among many people, there are those who seek to live as long as possible, there are others who choose to live for the moment. If a man decides that smoking a cigarette is worth the risk of the illnesses and a short life, then who are we to prohibit that? Health care: Certain rights are expensive, that does not mean we shouldn't have those rights. We pay for things we don't believe in all the time. Marketing to kids: Advertising cigarettes to kids are illegal, and it is illegal for ""kids"" to smoke cigarettes. If kids choose to break the law, why should cigarettes be illegal to adults? The same can be said about video games, which exploits sex, violence, crime, along many others. Simply said, the product cannot be banned because the producers may market to children. The choice: ""Cigarette smokers have the right to smoke. Non-cigarette smokers have the right not to be forcibly exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay the hidden health care costs for smokers."" Smokers don't go around nonsmokers with a mission to give them second-hand smoke, furthermore there are laws put into place to minimalize second and third-hand smoking, such as banning indoor smoking. If you don't want to be around secondhand smoke, don't be around them. Compromises can be made, and have been made. [1] ""Although fast food and alcohol have some addictive properties, quitting either of them will not give you withdrawal symptoms."" Actually quitting alcohol abruptly can kill you and alcohol does give you withdrawals [2], along with caffeine and sugar [3]. If anything that gives you withdrawals should be illegal, then sugar, caffeine, and alcohol must be respectively illegal. ""If we can remove a choice to do other addictive drugs like heroin, why can we not do so with nicotine? We recognize in our society that addiction is not truly a choice."" Heroin can be overdosed very easily, which leads to death. Long time users develop a tolerance for it, to a degree where the user needs to inject have amounts just to feel ""normal"". People do not overdose on nicotine, and neither does cigarette have nearly the potency to do what heroine does. ""I'd like to note that at the end of the day, my opponent has no response to the fact that the hidden productivity and health care costs mean that non-smokers have to pay $7.18 for each pack of cigarettes that a smoker purchases. This unfair economic burden is why cigarettes should be banned."" There are a plethora of wasted tax dollars [4], point being, we all have to pay for things we don't want to. In the case of cigarettes, we pay the price for the right to smoke. Prohibition: While agreeably, there are not as many smokers as drinkers, this does not mean that prohibiting cigarettes won't increase crime rates. It opens a new black market and makes America a hot zone for organized crime. Economic benefits of smoking: Banning cigarettes would mean that Tobacco farmers would lose their primary patrons. People can only chew so many nicotine gums, and competition to export tobacco to other countries will be fierce. The damage this would do to farmers is evident. In addition, the $2 billion added to the economy from smoking is completely outweighed by the $157 billion lost every single year from the economy from smoking due to lost productivity and higher health care costs. Banning cigarettes won't make smokers quit (Similarly to the Prohibition Era), there are plenty of drugs that are illegal and still widely abused, which means that the lost productivity and health care costs could face no real change. However, if we do ban smoking the tax revenue from cigarettes will be definitely lost, and millions of employees would lose their jobs as a result from it. If anything, rebellious teenagers will be more attracted to cigarettes if they become illegal. Right to smoke: ""Remember from before that others have the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay higher health care premiums. Society must decide whose rights are more important."" Secondhand smoke can be avoided by the electronic cigarettes. [6] ""In addition, people may have the right to do heroin, that doesn't mean that we should allow them to do so."" No, people do not have the right to do heroin. That right is denied by the government. ""Maybe people should also have the ""right"" to have a consensual sexual relationship with a child."" People don't have that right, and I don't see how sex with children is relevant to smoking cigarettes. Indeed, children do not have the ability to make the most rational choice, but that doesn't mean adults should suffer as a result of that. ""In summary, ban smoking because it is not really a choice – most people choose to smoke as children because they are inundated with advertising convincing them to do so."" It is illegal to advertise cigarettes to children [7]. If anything, teens start smoking due to peer pressure [8]. In summary, banning cigarettes won't make people quit. If anything, it will become ""cool"" and more daring to try, especially for teens, which is counterproductive. At the same time, we lose all tax revenue from cigarettes, if we were to ban the product, not to mention, myriads would be unemployed as a result. All of us are accountable for the choices we make in our lives, some choices will be bad, others good. It is ideal to make only good choices in life, but once we start enforcing the ""good"" choices, we have no choices to make at all. Regarding my opponent's objection that smoking is not a choice. If a smoker really wants to quit, they can do it [9]. There are numerous ex-smokers, who CHOSE to quit. Sources: [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://alcoholism.about.com...

S8c1650c4-Abf230d6d	All drugs should be legalised, change my mind.	"I'm aware of that people cant function as well while high, and I never claimed it either. What I said was, if they can make their lives go around while doing drugs, then why stop them? If they cant however, then I think that they should be offered help. I'm also aware of the harm a drug can do to a man. But that is something that he or she should have to be aware of while buying and taking the drug. You said ""the reason 1 in 3 adults are not dead or otherwise in a bad way is because they quit."" see? most of them can make that decision themselves. As stated before, anyone that cant make that decision themselves should be offered help. But now you are making the same argument as before, you admit that in most cases they quit themselves. So you are taking a small exceptional case, and use that as an argument for making all cases illegal. You said ""these people who hear about how drugs are the ""high of a lifetime"". Don't you think that people are already hearing this? The sellers will use the same methods to trick people into buying drugs no matter if it is legal or not. But the problem is, if it is illegal, regular people wont notice the lies that the sellers use, because they are at the black market when it is illegal. ""As for the law being an obstacle, it certainly makes it harder to go get drugs"". Well that's the problem I explained in my last argument. If drugs are harder to get, the price goes up, if the price goes up, the demand for a new, less expensive and more powerful drug will start growing, this effect will boost the development of drugs, and it is the very reason for so called ""Internet drugs"". ""Drug dealers are people who exploit others for gain"" This is only the case if it is illegal. If it is legal however, we can regulate the market in such a way that the buyer has to understand the scientific risks of doing drugs in order to buy them. By then, is it really an exploitation if the buyer is aware of the dangers, is aware of the risks, but still decide that the positives outweighs the negatives for him. ""it was also because cocaine is a stronger high than cannabis"" This just proves my last argument, a high drug price leads to new, cheap and potentially more dangerous drugs. I'm also aware of that only some people would seek help for their addiction, but if someone put himself there, by knowing the risk of an addiction, then it would be his own fault, and he would still be in the same position if it were illegal. I know I said that I would not bring up the: Its their own choice argument, but yet here it comes My question for you is: If drugs are illegal because people are too stupid to be trusted to decide if they want to ""ruin their lives"" with addiction, ""depression"", schizophrenia, why are the same people, through voting, qualified to make good decisions with regards to, war, economics, abortion, the death penalty, international trade, schools, immigration, liberties… and yes ironically, if people should be allowed to do drugs or not?"

S1304ecba-Aa4b413f8	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"== Framework == Let's discuss what the resolution does and does not require. The resolution *requires* Wlyted to argue for full legalization of child porn. The resolution *does not* require Mikal and I to argue for the status quo. As long as child pornography is not completely ""legalized,"" we are still negating the resolution. For example, marijuana is not considered to be ""legalized"" in California, even though it is *not* illegal in all circumstances (i.e. it is permitted for ""medical"" use). Thus, Mikal and I do not have to defend illegality in all circumstances. With this in mind, Mikal and I propose the following child porn law: (1) Knowingly producing or possessing pornographic images or videos of a child shall be illegal, subject to the following exceptions: (a) It shall not be illegal for a child to produce or possess pornographic images or videos of himself or herself. (b) It shall not be illegal for a romantic partner of a child to possess pornographic images or videos depicting the child, provided that at the time the romantic partner came into possession of the images or videos, the romantic partner was of an age at which a sexual relationship between the romantic partner and the child would have been permissible (under the relevant statutory rape law). (2) ""Child"" means a person below the age of consent. (3) ""Knowingly"" means having actual knowledge that the child is below the age of consent or acting with willful ignorance or extreme recklessness towards the age of the child. == Benefits of Our Regime == (1) No prosecution of children for producing images of themselves As Wylted points out, child pornography laws are problematic because under the current legal regime, a 14 year old who takes a naked picture of herself could theoretically be prosecuted for ""producing child porn."" However, our first exception takes care of this problem. (2) No prosecution of boyfriends or girlfriends who share naked photos People in relationships sometimes share naked photos of themselves as a form of flirtation. Under our second exception, if both partners could legally have sex under statutory rape laws (e.g. they are both below the age of consent), then there""s no reason they can't also share naked photographs with each other. Wylted says statutory rape laws themselves are problematic, but that's outside the scope of this debate. The resolution allows us to craft these ""exceptions"" for two reasons. (1) Adding a few narrow exceptions to a criminal statute does not render the subject matter of the statute ""legalized"" (e.g. having a ""self defense"" exception to ""murder"" does not mean that murder has become ""legalized""). We only need to argue for *some* illegality to prove that child porn should not be fully ""legalized."" (2) Taking a naked selfie or sharing a naked photo only with an intimate partner is not considered ""porn"" within the meaning of the resolution. Google defines ""pornography"" as ""printed or visual material containing the . . . display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."" Couples share intimate photos with each other not solely to stimulate arousal, but also to strengthen their emotional connection. This interpretation comports with common usage. For example, Jennifer Lawrence has defended taking naked photos of herself for her boyfriend by saying, ""It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you."" Since such private photos are not considered ""porn,"" the resolution does not require us to advocate that possessing them should be illegal. == Our Case Against Child Porn == (1) Children cannot consent In statutory rape law, there is something called the ""age of consent,"" which is the age below which children are considered incapable of consenting to sex. The rationale behind the ""age of consent"" is that children below a certain age lack the maturity to consent to sex with an older person (who may be manipulating them) *and* that children who have not even hit puberty cannot fully understand the *significance* of sex because they have not even experienced sexual desire. Children lack the knowledge and awareness of how a naked photo of them might be put to nefarious uses by an adult. Child porn laws protect naive children from exploitation by adults. This problem is even more dire because a lot of child sexual abuse is committed by family members, whom the child is more likely to trust and obey than a stranger. Family members are responsible for up to 47 percent of child molestation cases. [1] There are sadly *multiple* accounts online of depraved parents sexually exploiting their young daughters by using them to make child porn (I""ve linked three separate examples). [2] Without child porn laws, parents could not be prosecuted for taking pornographic pictures of their children and posting them online. Uncles and aunts who exploit their nephews and nieces would be immune from prosecution. Because children sometimes need to be protected from adults, child porn laws are necessary. Wylted spends a lot of time in his case arguing why *possession* of child porn should be legalized, but offers *no* good reason that *production* of child porn should be legal, even though the resolution requires him to prove both. And production is definitely the more problematic aspect of child porn. (2) Viewing child porn increases the likelihood that the person will molest a child As James Wolak explains in American Psychologist, pedophiles who view images of child pornography become more likely to molest children because viewing such images serves to *normalize* their fetishization of children and strengthens their urges. [3] It is a common saying in psychology that ""neurons that fire together, wire together."" When people masturbate to child porn regularly, they strengthen the association they have between sexual desire and ""children."" One child molester (who is serving a 14-year sentence in a Canadian federal prison) said that looking at child porn online made him more likely to molest children because, he said, ""there is no way I can look at a picture of a child on a video screen and not get turned on by that and want to do something about it."" [4] A report by Carr (2004) concluded, ""Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children."" The studies bear out these conclusions. A longitudinal study of convicted child molesters in the U.S. found that those who consumed more child porn were *more likely to reoffend* after their release. [5] A study by Butner et al estimated that 76 percent of people who consume child pornography have had some sort of illicit physical contact with a child. [6] The study Wylted cites *does not* prove that viewing child porn *causes* a reduction in molestations. The study essentially notes that the internet made porn widely available starting around 1989, and child molestation has also gone down since 1989. Wylted then assumes a *causal* connection from this. However, first, in most of the countries cited in the study (such as Canada, Germany, and the United States), child pornography is actually *illegal.* Therefore, one could just as easily conclude that when the internet made child porn more available, the police were able to lock up more dangerous pedophiles by catching them viewing child porn. Getting these pedophiles off the street made the molestation rate go down, not the viewing of the child porn itself. Second, correlation is not causation. *All* violent crime rates have been falling since 1989, not just rape and child molestation. The child molestation rate went down due to *overall* crime trends, which have been influenced by larger police forces, better investigative technology, and harsher penalties for all crimes (e.g. ""three strikes"" and ""truth in sentencing"" laws). (3) Child porn laws are a proxy for catching molesters Molesters are often hard to catch because children often stay silent about abuse. However, the high correlation between child porn and molestation means that locking up people caught with child porn *also* happens to catch a lot of molesters. In one study containing 115 offenders convicted of *only* possessing child porn, 91 offenders later admitted (in counseling) to having molested a child. [6] Based on this study, up to 79 percent of people convicted only of possessing child porn may *also* be molesters. The Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a report stating that ""many Internet child pornography offenders may be undetected child molesters."" Therefore, locking people up for a crime that is relatively easy to detect (downloading child porn) is a proxy for also catching people for a crime that is relatively hard to detect (molestation). Downloading child porn *is* easier to detect. The FBI has a lot of systems in place for catching people sending or receiving child porn (for example, they have a database that Google uses to scan Gmail accounts to see if any images sent or received match a known image of child porn). If you vote for Wylted's plan to legalize child porn, you are allowing a lot of child molesters to escape prosecution because the only crime the state could have actually convicted them for was possessing child porn, since their molestations have (as yet) gone undetected.

S255646d7-Ad426b6b4	There should not be any type of ban on Abortion	"first of all, i was unclear on what i meant on many of my issues. 1.) when i meant that the father should have a say in the abortion of the child, it was to say that the decision on abortion shouldnt be just the decision of the mother. and even if the father isnt involved, the child who would one day be a grown person, he is still being affected so he should have a say. 2.) my opponent also made a mistake in his statements. ""Sorry, but I don't think you would. Fetus' cannot feel pain, or for that matter, emotions while they're in the womb."" you would feel MUCH pain if you were in the end of the 3rd month because by then your nervous system is already funtioning as well as your digestive system ( thats why you can see a physical change in the mother). Believer also said that the fetus would only serve as a painful reminder for the mother. wouldnt the mother have a more painful reminder of her taking the life of her offspring. As for his statement on a diseased child, there really isnt a way to see that the child has a disease until the end of the 2nd trimester, in which the child is almost fully developed, it just has to grow more. and even a mercy kill is wrong because you never know if there will be a cure discovered for the disease over the course of the childs life."

S203a1bed-Ae8ec2289	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"Round 1 is for acceptance; however, allow me to briefly explain the resolution. Though I could have used ""Drugs ought to be legal"" or some such formulation, I structured the resolution this way for a couple of reasons: 1. I wanted to indicate a total lack of involvement on the part of the state. Some may claim that we should ""legalize"" drugs by allowing their use, but also taxing and regulating. I want my position, which emphasizes zero state involvement, to be clear: no bans, no penalties, no taxes, no regulations. Zero involvement. Additionally, the debate will be structured for maximum conflict, as my opponent has advocated on his profile that he is in favor of taxing and regulating some drugs, decriminalizing others (which usually allows for penalization like fines and mandatory rehabilitation), and keeping legal bans on those which he regards as most dangerous. Though the burden of proof is very much on my opponent to justify legal action against drug use, this debate also requires me to defend the position of liberty. Should neither of us make compelling arguments, you obviously render the debate a tie in that category. 2. The resolution doesn't imply a moral obligation on the part of the state. Though it's possible for either of us to make moral arguments, the debate uses ""should"" in the sense of ""You should go to the doctor"", rather than in the sense of ""you shouldn't kill"". Should my opponent have any comments, concerns or questions prior to accepting the debate, the comments are the proper place for addressing them."	PRO	273
Sc99e004-Afc8e641c	Empathy should have no role in judging appeals	"I have explained how empathy should be used. Empathy can effectively be used in interpreting the law. As was shown in Brown v. Board, it sometimes takes empathy to correctly interpret the law. I showed the relevant parts of the decision. They clearly showed how empathy was used to show the inferior feelings African-Americans felt as a result of a segregated education. Empathy should be used when applicable. It should be used to inform and compliment a judge's decision. It plays an important role in interpreting not only the societal effects of a law, but the societal effects of the decision. I have already explained this, so it's kind of late to act as if I haven't said what role it should have. Studying the societal effects of a law, and studying the societal effects of a decision will ultimately render a better decision. This was shown in Brown v. Board. Now, Pro originally wrote, ""We should want judges who reach decisions solely based upon the law, not feelings."" He now proposes the ""living Constitution"" theory as an option. This comes into direct contradiction with his earlier statement. The concept of a living Constitution can be described in many ways, but it is not described as founded solely in law. It is founded more on interpretations and opinion than actual law. Pro proceeds to use a straw man argument in saying I just want the judge's personal opinion to come into play. I never said that, and your definition of empathy does not say that. A judge's personal feelings are not the same at all as the identification with others' thoughts, feelings, and states. I am not going to dignify Pro's argument that the decision will be based on the judge's feelings. His definition of empathy does not back this up. In case you forgot, he defined empathy as ""the intellectual identification of the thoughts, feelings, or state of another person."" This is not the same as what he describes. A huge problem is that much of Pro's argument has been based on nothing. He has used words like ""imply"" to attack my argument because I haven't actually said what he writes. He uses ""seems to assume"" in this round to act as if I feel the judge will always feel the way I do. This is not true. I know several issues that judges will not agree with me on, based on their decisions in the past. I don't argue that the court should feel sorry for Savana Redding. Pro made a huge mistake in that and really hurts the legitimacy of his argument. I said the court should empathize with her and the school. Empathy is not the same as sympathy. It's just important to see the court see themselves in the same situation to see if their rights are violated. If we don't have the courts using every situation to back up our rights possible, our rights will not mean much at all. Pro's argument in this aspect is based on terrible reasoning and falsehoods. ""But if a justice happened to empathize with the school administration trying to keep order in an unruly school, a notion that empathy should play a role allows any decision dictated by the jurist's feelings."" Apparently, you forgot when I wrote this: ""However, I certainly want the justices of the Supreme Court to also empathize with the school and think about the security of a school."" As I have shown, it is sometimes necessary to use empathy to see if someone's rights have been violated. The point of pointing out that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction was to show a false premise in your argument. No, my implication is not that judging according to law is rarely adequate. If you've read my responses in this argument, my statements have been that judging according to law is not always adequate. I also never said empathy ought to be the tipping point. Empathy can be the tipping point, though. The fact is Pro's assumption that the Arizona State Legislature would act in favor of regulation of school searches is baseless. They have not made any progress in the five years since Savana Redding was searched. It is unfair to assume the legislatures will act where the Supreme Court does not. As Pro has shown in Round 3, his argument is based largely on a lack of understanding of the word ""empathy"". In the first round he wrote, ""Empathy is ""the intellectual identification of the thoughts, feelings, or state of another person."""" He has proceeded to confusing empathy with feelings. Empathy is not the same as sympathy. Empathy is not the same as feelings. Much of his argument is based on this faulty premise. ""Con claims that the Brown v. Board of Education was decided based upon empathy, but Con offers no evidence in support of that view."" I most certainly did. You can choose to ignore that evidence, but I definitely did. Here it is again: ""We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can it be determined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws….In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, supra, the Court, in requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations: "". . . his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession."" Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone….A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn."" If you read the decision, the inherent inequality of segregation was based on the inferiority African-Americans felt as a result of their segregation. My argument is completely backed up by this sentence: ""To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone"" Chief Justice Warren empathized with the feelings of young African-Americans, as made apparent by that quote. The decision says ""a feeling of inferiority"". That is using empathy effectively along with the law. Also, I did not say Pro thought the law was black and white. I said you would like it to be. That is made apparent by your language. Also, the options you provided are not founded solely in law. The ""Living Constitution"" theory is not founded solely in law. Judicial precedent can sometimes be faulty. Pro failed to refute my argument regarding Brown v. Board of Education. I showed specific language from the decision that shows empathy was used to strike down segregation. It was effectively used alongside the law. As I have stated over and over again, the Constitution is not always clear. It contains broad language. We sometimes need to use empathy to see if others have to deal with injustice. This has been proven in this argument. Empathy should be continued to be used to recognize the societal implications of laws. Laws can sometimes treat certain people unfairly, violating the Equal Protection Clause. But this unfairness cannot always be seen from an objective standpoint. Sometimes it does take the intellectual identification with their feelings and thoughts. Empathy should also be used in seeing the societal implications of a decision. As we've seen, Plessy v. Ferguson was unconstitutional because of the inherently unequal segregation policy it allowed. This was not overturned until empathy was used to overturn it. Had empathy been used in Plessy v. Ferguson, we hopefully could have progressed a lot faster than we actually did. I hope that empathy will continue to be used when the law is not enough and to back up the law."	CON	274
Sc99e004-Ae08e70d8	Empathy should have no role in judging appeals	"I'm sorry if my words implied that most Supreme Court cases are close decisions, so I'll clear that up. The sentence in question states, ""As reflected in the close decisions, 5 of the 9 Supreme Court justices usually wind up on the ""liberal"" side and 4 usually wind up on the ""conservative"" side."" I was referring to the close decisions when I used the word ""usually"". I did not mean that most cases are close if that's how you took it. Much of your argument is based on something that's not really there. I never said most Supreme Court cases are close. The only other sentence that could possibly imply that would be this one: ""This observation gives heavy support to the claim that most cases rarely involve a clear right or wrong answer because the Supreme Court is often split."" In that one, I just meant the Supreme Court is often split. It has happened many times over the years, allowing me to use the word ""often"". Also, Pro is misrepresenting my argument. My rationale for why not all decisions could be decided from the basis of law was not just because they were close. The Constitution contains broad language that is not specific enough for each case to use as its sole basis. I stated that several times and made it pretty clear. Not only does Pro misrepresent my argument in that way, but Pro also states, ""and wrong in suggesting that empathy is needed to resolve the cases that are close"". I never once said that empathy should be used to resolve all cases that are close. There was no contradiction in that statement. I explained why a judge should use empathy. Being a factor deciding an outcome and deciding an outcome are two different things. I said, ""Empathy is not meant to decide the outcome of a case."" I did not say empathy could not be a factor in deciding the outcome. Pro is attacking a straw man argument. I never said empathy could not be a factor in a decision. It just should not be the only factor in a decision, and it should compliment and inform the judge's approach. Pro stated, ""The sole function of the Supreme Court is to determine if a lower court did not follow the law, including the Constitution."" This is not true. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over disputes between states. Article III, Section 2 of our Constitution states, ""In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction."" Pro proceeds to give examples of how to decide cases solely by law, other than just using the Constitution. Reliance upon a precedent does not make the precedent correct. Option C comes into direct contradiction with this entire argument. A broader interpretation does not help with basing decisions on the law. Rather, its proponents base their rationale on the Founding Fathers' intent: that the Constitution be broad and ""living"" to accommodate change over time. This is not helping your argument because it's not entirely based in law, which goes against your rigid assertion earlier. The concept of the Living Constitution branches out into different interpretations, which don't strictly follow the law. The options Pro provided still leave room for topics that haven't been covered. The options also ignore that the precedent could be wrong. As we saw with Brown v. Board, the precedent was wrong. Reliance on the precedent can often unfairly affect the oral arguments, in that the precedent is assumed to be correct, and it can excuse the Supreme Court from more thought on the law in too many cases. There are still cases of first impression, and the precedent isn't always right. These make cases fall outside of the options he provided. I think Pro mistakenly quoted the part about English law, since English law obviously has no legal standing in our judicial system. Pro's next argument is based on a false premise. It is unfair to assume that parents will be outraged that their legislature has allowed such a thing and march towards the Capitol. I assume it is hyperbole. Pro makes unfair assumptions in the actions of the citizens of Arizona. The assumptions that it will create change are unfair because it has been five years since the incident, yet no big change in regards to searches of students has come about in that time period. The magnitude of the ruling of the Supreme Court will set a standard for schools all across the country, helping prevent such searches in other states if they rule in Savana's favor, and may lead to the Arizona state legislature restricting searches in other ways. Assuming the legislature will reform searches in schools by themselves is unfair and unsubstantiated. Pro then references a fundamental error in my argument, which isn't much of an error at all. Pro brings up Griswold v. Connecticut, and says the laws in question would have inevitably been overturned. This fails to consider how long it would take before the law was repealed. There is no way of knowing how long it would take before the law was repealed. This is not a fundamental error at all, because I can't assume the legislatures will take away every unjust law by themselves. It is irrational to assume popular demand will always have the same effect of the Supreme Court's ruling, if not more. Empathy is important because it helps the judge not only see the societal implications of his or her ruling, but it also helps him or her see the societal implications of the law in question. I will quote from Brown v. Board: ""We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can it be determined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws….In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, supra, the Court, in requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations: "". . . his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession."" Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone….A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn."" The empathy in that decision is clear. Chief Justice Warren clearly emphasized with the feelings of young African-Americans around the country. Empathy was instrumental in the decision to integrate schools and strike down the unconstitutional ""separate, but equal"" ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson. This case embodies how empathy should be used by a justice. Through the identification of the feelings of young African-Americans, the Chief Justice saw the inherent inequality that came with segregation. The law is not black and white, as Pro would like it to be. The Constitution still contains broad language, and many parts are open to personal interpretation. Empathy should play an important role in judge's approach to each decision. The judge should use empathy to see the societal implication of the law in question. The judge should also use empathy to see the societal implication of his or her ruling. As I have shown, empathy can be important in judging laws' constitutionality. Brown v. Board successfully used the language of the Constitution and the value of empathy to decide that the ""separate, but equal"" ruling was unconstitutional and that segregation was inherently unequal. Empathy helps see each law in action. If we are to honor the Constitution, then empathy should be used to uphold the words of our Constitution. Those words were held up in Brown v. Board with empathy playing a huge role in the decision."	CON	275

So, if those odds are enough to get you to vote for my opponent, by all means... The reality is, however, that not all obese people are extraordinarily overweight by society's standards. In the past few years, the average waist line has expanded by 2 inches. Seeing thicker people is now more common, and you yourself may be obese or even have a family member who is considered obese without you even knowing it. For instance, if you are 5'5"" and weigh 180 lbs, you are obese. If you are 5'8"" and weigh 198 lbs, you are obese. Not all obese people are as massive as the one represented in the picture, and my opponent made no differentiation between that guy and the masses. Thus you must disregard the image and actually hold it against my opponent for stooping to that level (desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess). Next some $$ issues come into play. Pro says, ""However, had the airline intervened and helped the gentlemen get a specialized seat (at a slight increase in expense), neither of you would have had to endure that experience!"" What BS! Apparently he hasn't been paying attention throughout this debate where a huge focus has been the decline of airline resources, and how airlines are on INCREDIBLY tight budgets would eliminate any opportunity to implement new seating. If this were to actually happen, it would cost A LOT more than a ""slight increase"" of cost. I've noticed that Pro exaggerates quite a bit, hmm? Also, if this extra cost were applied to everyone, then it would not just be obese people paying extra for flights but EVERYONE. This contradicts the resolution. Then Pro suggests that obese people should have to pay between $20 - 50 extra per flight. I'm sure you can figure out that this small cost would not be enough to cover the cost of ripping out already existing airline seating and replacing it in terms of man power, cost of products, cost of supplies, etc on EVERY flight. Further, if the original goal was to have obese people buy an extra seat, we all know that a plane ticket costs well over $20. Thus, the airline would lose a lot of money here... and this doesn't even include the fact that by implementing more, larger seating, the airline would lose money in the sense that it reduces the amount of available seating per flight. This inconvenience could wind up costing airlines big time in the end, meaning it would cost money for ALL flyers as well. Considering that the odds are HIGHLY AGAINST you sitting next to an obese individual (10%!), well, you do the math. Next Pro tries to use the logic of, ""When an obese person walks into a department store to buy plus-sized clothing, does he or she not pay more for the extra fabric?"" Um, actually no - they don't. If Jen buys a pair of jeans in a size 4 and Jess buys the same pair in a size 16, they will both pay the same price for the jeans. And yes, at size 16, Jess is considered to be obese. Thus this logic does not stand here. Pro says, ""Of course, the group of people required for this small fee would be small. We're talking about the truly obese here (BMI greater than 3.5), not the common overweight."" Well okay, you actually need a BMI greater than 30 to be over-weight, but nevertheless, this would actually include a lot of people. See some examples of weight statistics above (i.e. if your dad is 5'10"" and weighs 210 lbs, he would have to pay extra for a flight, AND - according to Pro - not be able to sit with you or his family due to the necessity of him having to sit in ""specialized seating""). Speaking of which, this kind of ""specialized seating"" is degrading to those who are forced to endure such an experience against their will. Things like this are NOT TOLERATED. So indeed my opponent's claim that ""this eliminates the need for embarrassing moments"" because the ""obese are people too"" is BS. Then Pro tries to portray a happy-go-lucky scenario of someone buying a ticket and being asked whether or not they prefer plus sized seating. While I agree that a little extra room would be preferable, I also acknowledge that paying extra for it is NOT. Some people wouldn't want to or wouldn't be able to afford it, but Pro is suggesting that it's mandatory. If it's not mandatory, or if obese people wouldn't have to pay extra for this seating, than that completely negates the resolution in and of itself (because obese people are not paying more). Going back to old contentions, Pro asserts that taxation on things like cigarettes are so high because the government is essentially taxing for insurance. Uh, that's not true -- I cannot believe that Pro is actually naive enough to believe that high taxes are for INSURANCE purposes...?! Alright, I'm dumbfounded, so I'll let a quick cited source do the talking for a moment... ""The legislative controls in this case, which are represented by higher tobacco taxes, were not intended to cause people to quit smoking but rather to increase revenue. The state's claim that these punishment-style taxes are to encourage people to quit smoking for health reasons has only a smidgen of truth, just enough to become the facade... Since unequal taxation is inequitable, it is a human rights violation, more specifically an equal rights violation. The higher tax rate on tobacco is inequitable because it doesn't affect all citizens equally, only smokers. Targeting a minority is inequitable."" The source for this information is the Bureau of International Information Programs (U.S. Dept of State) which can be found here --> [1]. Thus my opponent's propositions are not only morally wrong, but unconstitutional as well... at least via the current interpretation by government. In terms of my other contentions, Pro has merely brushed the surface on a defense. He says that I must prove genetics to be the #1 cause of obesity, but that is untrue -- After researching the main causes for the disease, what I came up with was clear across the board: factors include genetics, lifestyle and psychological disorders. Stress was considered to be in the top 3-5 causes as well. However if we take a look at these causes, almost none of them are preventable. Genetics - obviously not. Lifestyle - nope. Because you are born into it. If a child is raised in a household where parents/people over-eat, they will imitate the same behavior. People also cannot choose their culture (another huge factor) or necessarily control the stress in their life, etc. Bottom line, Pro is wrong here. Because he even wants taller/larger people in general to pay extra, and obviously people cannot control their HEIGHT. Again, this is highly discriminatory and WOULD NEVER FLY (no pun intended) without serious legal repercussions. Also, since Pro is once again naive enough to believe that obesity law suits do not exist, he might be surprised at the results of Googling ""obesity personal injury law."" A tip? IT DEFINITELY EXISTS! [2] So no, unlike Pro, I have not made up any random facts throughout this debate. I don't need to stoop to that in order to be a good debater. Btw - Pro never included citation regarding the # of obese people who require medical attention on flights to prove HIS point, so disregard it. It also does not address other high-risk flyers. I've noticed that Pro did not respond to my arguments regarding cargo space/weight, costs and other points -- clearly he has not been the better debater in this debate.

Sc351e266-Ad6bf0d77	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"Well-argued Whiteflame. First I would like to apologize… I did not mean to add confusion to the debate by directing sources to a separate debate. I noticed that the links did not light up in blue and assumed that they were copied and pasted without the full url. Sorry about that. 1) Safety- Pro claims “Enforcement is, itself, harmful.” Naturally, as is true with every type of law enforcement. Is pro suggesting that no law should be enforced if it is harmful? Pro argues that “It is estimated that if prostitution were legalized in the United States, the rape rate would decrease by roughly 25% for a decrease of approximately 25,000 rapes per year."" The same source he took this from states “There are, of course, many problems with this data. Rape is a crime that regularly goes unreported and what is considered rape in one countries data set may not be considered rape in another. The homicide rate also suffers from being defined differently in different countries.” It seems that Pro’s source while willing to speculate admits many issues with the data provided. As such these numbers are mere speculation and not a reliable model to base a policy change. Legalization of prostitution does not lower the harm of STD’s as pro suggests. “In one of CATW's studies, U.S. women in prostitution interviewed reported the following: 47% stated that men expected sex without a condom; 73% reported that men offered to pay more for sex without a condom; 45% of women said they were abused if they insisted that men use condoms. Some women said that some establishments have rules that men wear condoms but, in reality, men still try to have sex without them. One woman stated: ""It's 'regulation' to wear a condom at the sauna, but negotiable between parties on the side. Most guys expected blow jobs without a condom(1) This shows the reality, whether there is enforcement of a condom policy or not, it ends up being left to the individual women in prostitution. This becomes less realistic when coupled with the offer of extra money as incentive. “So called ""safety policies"" in brothels did not protect women from harm. Even where brothels supposedly monitored the ""customers"" and utilized ""bouncers,"" women stated that they were injured by buyers and, at times, by brothel owners and their friends. Even when someone intervened to control buyers' abuse, women lived in a climate of fear. Although 60% of women reported that buyers had sometimes been prevented from abusing them, half of those women answered that, nonetheless, they thought that they might be killed by one of their ""customers"" (1) It seems idealistic to assume that legalizing prostitution would decrease harm as Pro suggests. Legalizing does not eliminate the demand to have unprotected sex. Which,due to monetary pressure and fear, is likely to happen frequently as indicated above. The stats provided by pro that suggest a decrease in abuse and rape is weak as even the source acknowledges errors in the data. 2) Justice-- The justice argument is entirely specious. As Pro has defined the right to work, any and all illegal activity could be deemed a right in terms of a job. Pro’s source states “No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.” The source also endorses the idea that Prostitution is a type of slavery. (2) So which is it? Does the right to work supersede the right to not be a slave? 3) Costs Part A asserts that the enforcement of the status quo is expensive. This is true. Something being expensive is not enough of a reason to dismantle or reverse a policy position. Though perhaps it is grounds to observe and restructure how such laws are enforced. Fighting cancer is expensive, this does not make me want to endorse cancer. Likewise, enforcing prostitution laws as outlawed may be expensive but that does not make endorsing it desirable. Part B asserts that money can be made for the government. I don’t deny it. However, to conclude that because money could be made we should make something legal is ludicrous. Millions could be made by legalizing slave labor as well… should we legalize that? In terms of Utility many things worth preserving cost a great deal. Likewise many deplorable acts could make money. Neither case is sufficient reasoning to implement a policy. States Rights: 1) Pro says “Con is arguing that there's an inherent barrier that prevents the federal government from engaging in this action. That doesn't matter.” Actually my rebuttal is that the Federal Government Should not because it does not have the authority. The U.S. Government has done many things in the past despite not having authority to do so. (IE, Indian removal act deemed unconstitutional, yet still implemented. Etc…) I did not argue that the U.S. Government is not capable but rather if it did so it would undermine States rights. I am in support of the Status quo position on States Rights. The Constitution of the United States limits the Federal Government; Each of the first 10 Amendments lists what the Federal Government CANNOT do. Including “The regulation of prostitution in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government. Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate commercial sex…” If the Federal Government was indeed in absolute control, why does the Constitution restrict it and not it's ""subordinates"" (States)? It behooves my opponent to accept the burden to provide evidence of why circumventing this restriction is beneficial as he is arguing against the status quo. His only point addressing this is that “having the federal government act invites beneficial discussion, as it results in nationwide engagement in the discussion of both prostitution and the duties of the federal government.” This is an incredibly weak argument as the federal government acting is not the only way to invite a beneficial discussion on the topic. Indeed, we are having this discussion despite the federal government not having acted on this issue. 2) Pro argues that “The tenth amendment is incredibly vague.” I concede that many portions of the U.S. Constitution are in fact vague, it is clear however, that “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” Whether it should be left to the States or the people is vague… not vague is that it is not in the realm of federal jurisdiction. Again as Pro is arguing against the status quo, it is up to him to provide reasoning as to why the federal government should do something explicitly against the law. 3) Pro argues here that the Federal government “most notably regarding interstate commerce. Congress has actually passed constitutional laws criminalizing prostitution from this perspective most notably regarding interstate commerce.” This is within the rights of the federal government as regulating commerce is within the parameters that the federal government may act. He concludes thats ""Thisshows evidence of how such a law would be regarded by the current USSC, and therefore how a tenth amendment challenge would be ineffective.” It does no such thing. Regulating commerce is within the realm of federal power via the constitution. Prostitution directly is expressly not. Therefore the Tenth Amendment argument stands. Legalizing prostitution on a federal level is not within the realm of Federal power and is expressly stated in the 10th amendment that it is left to the States respectively or the people. This is an argument that the federal government Should Not and not that they Can not. Other thoughts: Pro says “If disease is the major concern, though, then there are plenty of other jobs that should also be eliminated based on this same concern, such as nursing staff, coal miners, and just workers in general. [28-30] If likelihood of acquiring an illness is the standard by which we determine if an occupation should be legal, then why aren't these other positions put under the same lens?” This is a clever retort. Perhaps those other positions should be put under the same lens. Out of curiosity I put the question to pro what would be a reasonable reason to outlaw a type of job? Do you believe such an argument could be made? Pro says “The reality is that prostitution is alive and well in this country, and that it will happen whether or not we do anything about it.” This is true of any if not all crimes. Following this logic should we legalize all crime or any activity that is “alive and well.” Pedophiles are alive and well, should those activities be legitimized just because they and their actions are “alive and well.” Pro “it's not a problem we can ignore.” I agree with this sentiment. I confess I do not know, nor desire to create a burden on myself to defend an alternative. What I do know is that the policy promoted by pro should not happen for numerous reasons as argued throughout. I conclude as I did in my previous round. The Federal Government does not have the authority to legalize prostitution on a federal level. Such an action is a clear violation of States rights. Aside from this implementation issue, it is empirically evident that prostitution is dangerous. This is due to the spread of disease, the psychological damage, the high mortality rate, and the physical violence that accompanies prostitution. Legalization of prostitution does not change its danger. I conclude as the U.S. Government did in 2002…. Whether legal or not, “prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing.” The United States Federal Government should not legalize prostitution. (1) http://www.icasa.org...

S459f795c-Ac31c4ae9	America Should have Single Payer Healthcare	"Rebuttal I: They claim they only believe in the Bills of Rights and the Constitution, so let me recite part of the Preamble to the Constitution; ""WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union... Pro has misunderstood the Preamble. We the People does not mean the Government, it means the citizens... That's basically we the people giving Government the right to exist. And what the Government is to do isn't black and white. I'll explain that later. It says the Government must provide all these things, but then says the Government must PROMOTE General Welfare. This implies the Government must promote, but not necessarily provide, general welfare. An issue with using Article 1 Section 8 is that it gives the Government the power to [insert here]. There is a difference between Can and Should. Sometimes providing for the General Welfare is best done by not doing something. This is what I meant be not being Black and White. Somethings, like Healthcare, seem like they would be for the General Welfare of the nation, but in fact hurts the nation. This is the same with Pro's 4th paragraph. A perfect union can not always be made by having the Government do things. I will list examples of this in Argument II. Rebuttal II: Private Healthcare is a ponzi scheme, were only the healthy and wealthy can afford to be seen by a Doctor... By law, no one may be refused Medical Attention for any reason besides ensuring more serious patients (as in more serious injuries, not wealthier people) get in first. As for Private Healthcare being a ponzi scheme, you should have filled your BOP for this accusation. Your whole argument is crap. Nothing supports your accusation accept for the fallacy you used to defend it... Appeal to Wealth. Besides, government-ran programs often find the most monetary corruption, as Japan and Canada shows.(1,2) 1) http://tinyurl.com... 2) http://tinyurl.com... Rebuttal III: As we approach financial cliff after financial cliff, and so on... Seeing as Government Healthcare is bankrupting the UK, and would add a huge cost onto the US budget, a cost that keeps increasing as the CBO keeps reassessing it, this claim is slightly misinformed. You seem to want to make that debt everyone else's problem. As wrong as me saying that may sound, life is harsh and the many shouldn't suffer so you don't have to. The government can not nanny everyone out of a problem. Government Healthcare would cost everyone $1215 a year ($176 billion a year.) Rebuttal IV: Conservatives will say survival of the fittest. The idea of Independence must be upheld. Independence comes with major responsibilities you may not want, but you can not cherry-pick which parts of Independence you want, or you (like the Brits, as I'll later explain) will lose it. Argument I: Bodily Autonomy Bodily Autonomy, often called Bodily Integrity, is a Supreme Court supported freedom, and is granted by the UN. What it means is that only you may govern your body. This is why a doctor can't perform a life saving surgery if you say no. ""Bodily integrity is the inviolability of the physical body and emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and the self-determination of human beings over their own bodies. It considers the violation of bodily integrity as an unethical infringement, intrusive, and possibly criminal."" -WIkipedia. Why is this so important? Look at the definition. It's basically about Personal Autonomy and Self-Determination over our bodies. As we know, freedom doesn't stop when our convenience stops. Autonomy 1: the quality or state of being self-governing; especially : the right of self-government 2: self-directing freedom and especially moral independence 3: a self-governing state(3) So to break it apart, Bodily Integrity is the idea of having Governance over our body. Governance over your body comes with being responsible for your body. You govern your body, therefore it must be your responsibility and not mine. Unless we BOTH consent to me being responsible. Universal Healthcare goes against the premise of Self-Governing because you take away everyone's Bodily Autonomy. Health Insurance is personal to everyone, they maintain autonomy, but Government Healthcare literally makes your body a public matter. 3) http://tinyurl.com... Argument II: Well-being of the Nation The Government must ensure everyone's well-being. Government Healthcare seems like it'd care for everyone's well being, but does it? In the UK, patients are often rejected because their issues aren't serious enough. Many people aren't getting put into a hospital until it's too late, or near to too late(4) and yet despite the UK's best efforts, the NHS is still financially collapsing. This is serious since the nation has a tiny military budget, even relative to size. With a little Military Budget, the NHS budget shouldn't be failing. People can't enter a hospital until they have Government Approval, even if they are willing to pay the bill. Government controls when they may enter. While the UK is European, they aren't that different from the US, but even than, a better example might be needed. Canada. Canada, despite being more like the US than most any other nation, is also facing issues. How bad is Canada's system? 900,000 on a waiting list at a time. This, matched with Hospital Waiting Time. In the US, it's 45 minutes, but it's 4 hours there. The only notable Healthcare System that isn't financially failing is Sweden's, but that might be because they own 75% of the economy, and has 55% taxes. Healthcare examples around the world show mass inefficiency in some of the best nations. It'd be in the best interests of the people's well being that Healthcare remain privatized. 4) http://rt.com... CONCLUSION: It is in the interests of Independence and the General Well-being of the people that Healthcare stay Privatized."	CON	278

S622af56b-A428ca3f8	Prostitution should be legalized in the US	"Thanks for the debate, Mikal. I'll start with my case and finish with rebuttals. NOTE: ""johns"" are ""guys who pay for sex."" == Trafficking == (1) Experience shows that when prostitution is legalized, sex trafficking increases. [A, B, C, D, E, F] Even in Nevada. [G, H, O] This happens because legalization increases demand. Not enough women want to prostitute, so the only way to meet that demand is through trafficking. (2) Most ""legal prostitutes"" are trafficking victims. [E, O] Unfortunately, police can't do anything about that, because police can't distinguish legal prostitutes from trafficking victims, or legal pimps from traffickers. Police also can't arrest trafficking victims, which is a huge problem, because most trafficking victims don't seek help. Pimps manipulate victims to think they're not victims, or to think they'll be killed if they seek help. [I, J, O] So, the only effective way to rescue trafficking victims is arresting them for prostitution. == Violence == (1) Prostitutes are lucky to get out with their lives. More prostitutes are murdered than any other group. The few that aren't still experience an extensive catalog of violence, including assault and rape. Their hair is pulled, faces ejaculated on; they are slapped, pinched, verbally abused, threatened, beaten, cut with knives, burned with cigarettes, and gang raped. Victims of torture describe similar acts. And like victims of torture, prostitutes report mouth and teeth injuries, vaginal bleeding, internal injuries, head injuries, and broken bones. The average life span for prostitutes is four years. [E, K, L] (2) The psychological harm is just as bad. Prostitutes measure higher levels of PTSD than combat veterans and victims of torture. PTSD results from going through atrocities you cannot mentally sustain. And PTSD isn't the only concern. Studies show prostitutes are at heightened risk of depression, mania, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, dissociative disorders, and drug abuse. This psychological damage stems from the act itself. Prostituted women simply cannot avoid the trauma associated with constant sexual degradation, and with having one's body sold as a commodity. In fact, studies find no difference in PTSD levels between street prostitution and brothel prostitution, which shows that the trauma is intrinsic to the act itself. [E, K, L] (3) These results are not limited to illegal prostitution. Even prostitutes working where prostitution is legal, in brothels with so-called “safety policies,” experience this extensive catalog of physical and psychological violence. The psychological harms are inherent, so no amount of improvement helps. And the physical harms also persist, because that's what the johns want, and they're willing to pay more for it. And prostitutes don't feel like they have a choice. And panic buttons usually fail. [E, K, L, M, O] == Rebuttal == (1) Regulation Regulation doesn't reduce illegal prostitution. Over 90% of prostitution in Nevada is illegal. [B, G, H, M, O] Also, see my trafficking evidence from earlier. As Mikal notes, 73% of men will pay more for sex without a condom, and those men create a market for illegal prostitution. Regulating prostitution isn't going to change that. (2) Safety First, since regulations don't reduce illegal prostitution, Mikal's ""minimization"" arguments regarding ""safety"" and ""STDs"" have no impact. Most prostitutes are still subject to all the harms. Second, ""safety policies"" don't work, because prostitution is inherently dangerous, degrading, and psychologically traumatic. [E, K, L, M, O] (3) Rape If legalization actually decreased rape, we'd see evidence of that in Germany, Australia, the Netherlands, and Nevada. But there isn't any such evidence. I'd argue that rape actually increases with legalization, because more prostitution means more prostitutes are raped. The reason we don't hear about it is because prostitutes almost never report rapes. Mikal's sources don't say otherwise. The study in [5, 6] used a regression model to analyze potential correlations between availability of prostitution and rape. The study made no claims about legalization actually reducing rape. Even worse, the study relied on the wrong definitions of rape (this fact was admitted in the study), and the study didn't consider unreported rapes (this fact completely skews the data). Taking those limitations into account, the correct interpretation of the data is that rapists target prostitutes over other women; other independent evidence supports that interpretation, including Mikal's [2] and [3]. When there's more prostitution available, more prostitutes get raped instead. Rape doesn't decrease, but reporting does, because prostitutes almost never report rapes. Mikal's [8] doesn't apply because it dealt with inadvertent decriminalization; Mikal's arguing for regulated legalization, which is completely different. Finally, Mikal's only other study -- the Queensland study -- is from 1959. It's completely outdated and therefore inapplicable to prostitution today. (4) Costs First, designating something as a crime shouldn't turn on enforcement costs and potential tax revenue. No one argues that trafficking, murder, or rape should be legal, even though legalizing them would generate massive savings. So too with prostitution. Money simply shouldn't factor into policy decisions about what to criminalize. Second, enforcement costs don't go down when prostitution is legal because legalization doesn't reduce illegal prostitution. If anything, enforcement costs go up, because trafficking increases. Third, Mikal's numbers are wrong. Mikal's [12] says the prostitution industry generates $14 billion a year. [12] There's no way to generate $20, $30, or $40 billion in taxes from an industry that only generates $14 billion. That's literally impossible. Mikal gets his numbers from [11], but [11] is wrong because (a) it assumes all illegal prostitution will be regulated, and (b) it assumes all prostitutes will earn at least $100,000 a year (i.e. earn just as much as the high-class prostitutes in Nevada). Both assumptions are wrong. Most prostitution would still be illegal, competition among brothels would bring prices down, and competition among states would bring tax rates down. So the actual tax revenue isn't even close to $20 billion. Of course, that's not surprising, since [11] isn't a credible source; it's just what some guy on the Internet said. (5) Consent First, no amount of consent makes a crime acceptable, because the whole point of criminal laws is to determine which *choices* are acceptable to society. Murder, rape, and trafficking are crimes even if victims consent. So too with prostitution. Second, prostitutes don't actually consent because they have no real alternatives (or at least they feel like they have no real alternatives). Poverty, homelessness, and past sexual abuse are the top reasons women are prostituted. Pimps often recruit illegal immigrants -- especially Central American women -- into prostitution by stealing their money and threatening deportation. And many women are simply beaten until they ""consent"" to prostitution. The so-called ""choice"" is thus only a choice between two evils: homelessness or prostitution, starving family or prostitution, deportation or prostitution, violent beatings or prostitution. Of course, that's not a real ""choice."" Most prostitutes want to leave prostitution but they feel they can't or don't know how. [E, K, L, M, N, O] This is not just like every other job. Prostitutes don't decide to be prostitutes instead of doctors, engineers, lawyers, pilots. Those options don't exist for prostituted women. When intereviewed, prostitutes say prostitution chose them. And they say they'd prefer doing anything else if they could. In Nevada, there are countless stories of legal prostitutes who speak to the public ""glowingly of how much fun prostitution was, how rich they were getting, how glamorous their life was."" And then -- when the pimps aren't looking -- they ask for ""help,"" ""saying she was there under captivity, that he had a gun, had threatened her life,"" and so on. [O] I urge everyone to read, or at least skim, [O]. It shows that prostitutes don't consent; they're tricked, coerced, and brainwashed by pimps. In many ways, prostituted women are like battered women. Like battered women, prostituted women depend on pimps economically, fear for their lives, and don't know how to get out. So they stay in prostitution just as battered women stay in their relationships. Think about it this way: Would we say that a concentration camp survivor who collaborated with the guards to get food and stay alive had consented to his abuse? Would we say an enslaved African in the Americas who became a house servant had done so voluntarily? No. To say there was choice there is absurd. And prostitution is no different. == Conclusion == Prostitution is inherently degrading. ""It is the mouth, the vagina, the rectum, penetrated by a penis, sometimes hands, sometimes objects, by one man and then another and then another and then another and then another."" Prostitutes don't want to have sex with those men. They do it solely because they're forced (literally or from financial necessity). And as a result, the entirety of their life is reduced to a few sexual orifices. The attendant harms -- harms on par with torture -- cannot be disputed. And legalization only increases those harms, because it makes enforcement harder while increasing trafficking. Only the pimps and johns benefit. [A] http://tinyurl.com...

Sa799c6ee-A2f5c9411	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	There is no end game to the war on drugs I agree. But this is not a reason to give up. The war on terrorism is not winnable. Do you suggest giving up and allowing terrorists free reign to plan, train for and execute attacks? No you should not. You should use all available resources to find terrorists and make them face justice. The battle against racial inequality is not winnable. Do you just give up and accept racism? No you do not. The point is there are numerous things in life that you are never going to eliminate entirely but it is perfectly reasonable to expect to be able to contain the problem more effectively and reduce the damage it does. I am a farmer. Each year I spray my crops for weeds. Depending on how much money I am willing to spend the wider range of weed species I will eliminate from my crops. Their are many different types of weeds that have varying effects on the crops. I have to make decisions based on a variety of factors. The cost of sprays, The level of weed presence in the crop, The amount of damage caused by the weed and the value of the crop. No matter what I do there will always be some weed species I have not considered or some that somehow evade the sprays through late growth or spray resistance. However my aim is not to eliminate weeds it is to maximise profits from the crops. Weed control is part of this process. The situation in developed economies such as the USA and the UK can be compared in this way to my situation. The main goal of these countries governments is not to eliminate drugs, It is to run a prosperous economy with high levels of economic growth while maximising the living standards and health of its citizens. The war on drugs is just one of many things governments do to achieve this goal. If these governments chose they could pile much more money into drug enforcement and reduce drug smuggling and drug use to a fraction of what it is today. However the money and resources needed to do this would be unviable. The point I am trying to make is that you need to keep something under control. In my case it could be problems with wild oats, The US government it could be crystal meth. You need to spend the right amount of money to prevent an economic and health disaster but not waste huge swathes of money to target one individual. Currently low level traffickers take a lot of the flack for smuggling. This is wrong I agree. Instead of viewing this as a reason for legalization and regulation, I think the approach needed is to offer these individuals significant reductions in sentances for help tracking down and arresting the big players in sting operations and major police raids. Also offer witness protection to these people through things such as changing identity and place of residence. In my view alcohol and tobacco are dangerous substances. If they were invented today they would never be legalized. In my view these substances should also be banned. It is no coincidence that the two legalized and regulated substances are the two most consumed dangerous substances. The fact alcohol and tobacco are legal despite all of the known health risks and education programmes shows how legalizing and regulating production of a substance increases the amount of the substance is consumed and the number of people who are affected by it. This is because people are deterred by consuming illegal substances. Yes it is true not everybody is but the vast majority of citizens find the thought of lurking around in dark alleys looking for a cannabis dealer less enticing then walking into the newsagents and buying a packet of cigarettes. This is despite the fact cannabis is less dangerous than tobacco. Most citizens generally do not like to break the law, deal with criminals or want to risk imprisonment. This is a clear deterrant for many people. As is the concern of the level of safety of an unregulated substance being sold by a criminal illegally. Legalization and regulation would increase the problems I have repeated many times in this debate. Another factor to consider is the damage done to town centres caused by having rows of drug stores, one for each substance as my opponent suggests. It would be harmful in numerous ways. The more drug stores the more chance people are going to use drugs. It normalizes drugs. It also sends a message to people drugs are acceptable and safe to use. Children would grow up used to the horoin shop next to the sweet shop and would be more likely to want to try heroin. The damage done to town centres images would also be considerable. Ten or fifteen shops selling drugs would make a town centre a no go area for shoppers and families and become areas of congregations of drug addicts. The economic and social implications of my opponents arguments would be horrific. I decline my opponents offer to change the terms of the debate.	CON	281

S203a1bed-Aae3a2c5	The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs.	"Introduction I thank my opponent. He has made a more sophisticated case than I anticipated. I will address the most relevant subset of his points, not all of them, given the limitations of space. Descriptive vs. normative ethics By all defininitions of ""normative ethics,"" the resolution is fully a statement of normative ethics, not merely descriptive ethics. Any advocacy or counteradvocacy of a political position is normative. Cody_Franklin advocates the political position of ""The state should not pass legislation regarding drugs."" He claims to be supporting merely descriptive ethics, but he is not merely describing the political position. As he himself has stated, ""...this debate also requires me to defend the position of liberty."" See this page for clarification of the distinction between descriptive and normative ehics: http://faculty.stedwards.edu.... The reason why this distinction is important is because the Instigator should not dress up his moral arguments as non-moral arguments and demand that I should use only non-moral arguments. Morality can not be avoided in this debate. One value vs. many values Pro claims that I used a slippery slope argument and a strawman argument. I intended neither an argument of slippery consequences nor a representation of Pro. In the relevant context, I merely intended to present and justify my position that ""We set limits to freedom, the same as all other values, according to a perceived maximization of our combined set of values."" Since Pro is seemingly arguing from only one single value (freedom from government), then I would like to know if Pro shares with me the advocacy of a plurality of values. If so, then he should argue by weighing more than one value. Self-ownership vs. addiction Regardless, I will argue my position from this point and onward using the seeming value system of Pro: self-ownership is the only relevant value. Pro rightly claims that, ""By arguing, my opponent and I both acknowledge each others' right to control exclusively our own bodies."" Therefore, he wrongly argues, I can not make arguments that undercut this implicit acknowledgment of self-ownership. I share with Pro a general support for self-ownership. However, it does not follow that it is contradictory to claim that a state's force should be applied to prevent substance addiction, because the argument is neglecting the established reality that addicts lose part of their self-control (or their ability to act according to self-ownership) when they become addicted to a substance. It is naive to think that the only relevant loss of an individual's self-ownership happens through the application of physical force. It should be an obvious reality that the loss of self-ownership also happens very frequently through designed neurological methods. If the actions of a first party are controlled by a second party against the will of the first party, then such a relationship contains the essence of enslavement. As a most relevant example, according to a 2008 report from Gallup (titled, ""Most Smokers in U.S. Want to Quit"" from http://www.gallup.com...), ""Among the 21% of Americans who say they smoke, 74% say they would like to give up smoking, and 67% say they are addicted to cigarettes."" This social reality is no accident. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health, November 2007, titled, ""Pharmacological and Chemical Effects of Cigarette Additives,"" (at http://ajph.aphapublications.org...) the conclusions are as follows: Modern cigarettes have been extensively engineered and optimized as nicotine delivery devices developed through major national and international research and development programs. The average smoker has been unaware of these efforts by the tobacco industry and of the extensive manipulation of cigarette chemistry. Our results indicate that more than 100 of 599 documented cigarette additives have pharmacological actions. Previous research18,21,22 has documented extensive efforts by the tobacco industry to use additives to mask the presence of ETS by reducing the visibility, odor, and irritability of tobacco smoke. Similar to the findings of previous studies, our results show that the tobacco industry used additives (1) that enhance or maintain nicotine delivery and could increase the addictiveness of cigarettes and (2) that mask symptoms and illnesses associated with smoking behavior. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic evaluation of the public health effects of cigarette additives or their combustion products. The tobacco industry has actively manipulated cigarette content by using potentially hazardous chemical and phytochemical additives that should be regulated. Unregulated use of additives in tobacco products subjects billions of smokers and nonsmokers alike to an uncontrolled experiment with potentially devastating health effects. If these methods of marketing are made available to entrepreneural producers of newly-legal dangerous drugs, then I challenge Pro to make his case for why this will not be a problem of enslavement well beyond the problem of proportional law enforcement power intended to prevent it. Proposed libertarian solution To his credit, Pro made a brief argument for the betterment of society in his closing paragraph: Fifth, you can get the advantages of restorative justice/rehab through private intermediaries, like contracts with insurance companies and employers to refrain from drug use, and mandatory rehab and probation (like higher premiums or routine drug tests) as a stipulation for breaking the terms, which means we don't need coercion. There are two problems with this solution: (1) Such a method is still coercion on the part of civil courts, merely distancing the involvement of law enforcement by one step, not removing it per Pro's postion of ""a total lack of involvement on the part of the state,"" and (2) this method would require either a penalty of mere monetary damages or the overhaul of the current legal principles of contract law. To explain the second problem, the greatest penalty that may be incurred for a breach of contract is monetary debt, and monetary debt has been proven to be a vastly insufficient method of coercion, because the power of addiction overwhelms an addict's fear of debt in favor of immediate reward. An experiment published in Neuropsychologia, 2002, ""Decision-making and addiction (part II): myopia for the future or hypersensitivity to reward?"" (at http://ahealthymind.org...) found that substance addicts persistently made decisions far more in favor of immediate reward than the control group. States the study: This behavior resembles that of patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial (VM) prefrontal cortex. It also reflects the behavior of SDI [substance dependent individuals] in real-life in that they prefer choices that bring immediate benefit (i.e. drug reward), at the risk of negative future consequences (e.g. loss of jobs, home, family and friends). The failure of progressive delayed punishment to deter SDI from seeking immediate reward is consistent with their ""myopia"" for the future in real-life, which persists in the face of rising negative consequences. Conclusion Though my opponent has made a valient attempt to justify his position strictly in terms of high-minded ethical theory, I encourage my opponent to think less in terms of theory and more in terms of practical expectations of proposed law based on scientific examinations and tested knowledge of human psychology and society. The most justifiable political position very typically depends on the latter, not the former."	CON	283
Sc351e266-A3c1918c3	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"This debate has been both enjoyable and challanging. Thanks again to Whiteflame. As stated by Whiteflame in round 1: “This is a policy-based resolution, and as such, it is my burden to present a case.” Summary of Whiteflame’s case: 1) Safety “Enforcement is, itself, harmful.” “I'm not suggesting that no law should be enforced if its harmful. I'm saying that if the enforcement of a law does more harm than good, then the law should be removed.” Pro does share evidence that enforcement is harmful, he even shares stats that may indicate enforcement is not effective at addressing the problem. Indeed he states that the “law is beyond flawed.” Unfortunately for Pro, he does not fill the burden that such enforcement is doing more harm than good. Thus he has left this claim hollow. In addition claiming that the status quo is flawed is not support for his policy, it is merely criticism of current conditions. This entire argument does nothing to help him fill his burden of proof in this debate. 2) Justice Pro’s closing statements here are amusing. He says “The dehumanization argument I gave there is reason enough to vote Con” I am happy to endorse his exhorting you to vote con, (as you should) though I think he meant to say pro. That aside, he does point out that my link did not work. I apologize, here is a link attached to Pro’s source that lists prostitution as a type of slavery. (1) I again state as Pro’s source does“No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.” 3) Costs Pro Concludes this part of his argument saying “Practically ending human trafficking and thus the kidnapping and enslavement of women is not a small impact.” If pro’s policy had the impact that he here claims… of course I would endorse it. Unfourtanetly it does not. As I stated in previous rounds It seems that Pro’s source while willing to speculate admits many issues with the data provided. As such these numbers are mere speculation and not a reliable model to base a policy change. So far as the financial incentive I again reiterate In terms of Utility many things worth preserving cost a great deal. Likewise many deplorable acts could make money. Neither case is sufficient reasoning to implement a policy. As this ends the portion of his arguments it is clear that Whiteflame has argued well, though at best he has only shown issues with the status quo. The burden that he accepted is to show that his policy is worth implementing. This has not been done. Summary of my case: States Rights Pro is right, When he says “Nowhere does he state any harms that result from ""undermin[ing] States rights.” I did not, and will not now in keeping with not making new arguments in a concluding round. It is also worth note that Pro does not deny, in fact his words seem to imply, that this action is a violation of States rights. Other thoughts: Pro states “Let's be clear that Con has only run a negative case throughout this debate. He has furnished 0 evidence and made no arguments for the status quo or even for keeping prostitution illegal.” Correct again, Pro accepted a full burden of proof in round 1. A burden that he has not filled. My role in this debate was to show your burden unfilled, this was simple as your whole case only attacks the status quo, it does not endorse in any solid way your policy change. Conclusions: The Federal Government does not have the authority to legalize prostitution on a federal level. Such an action is a clear violation of States rights. Even without showing impact pro essentially accepts this argument. Aside from this implementation issue, it is empirically evident that prostitution is dangerous. This is due to the spread of disease, the psychological damage, the high mortality rate, and the physical violence that accompanies prostitution. Legalization of prostitution does not change its danger. I conclude as the U.S. Government did in 2002…. Whether legal or not, “prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing.” The United States Federal Government should not legalize prostitution. As the burden that pro accepted has not been filled… Vote Con! Thanks for reading!"	CON	284
Sa799c6ee-A52320bcd	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	Firstly I will wish pro good luck for his/ her first debate. This is my third so we are both beginners. I agree that eliminating drugs and drug use entirely is impossible. This does not mean though that society and government does not try its best to do so. In my opinion the legalization of all drugs would be effectively giving up the battle against drugs. This would result in legalized unlimited sales of all types of currently illegal drugs. This would allow drug dealers to operate freely, able to coerce more people into buying drugs and becoming drug addicts. They would be free to sell anything they like and would likely increase sales of the most dangerous types of drugs due to the larger profit margin and the absence of serious prosecution. The removal of restrictions on drug use would lead to many people to believe taking drugs is OK. Many people who would never have tried drugs either because they were scared of the danger posed by drugs or the fear of persecution for using drugs would take drugs. Many of these people would become drug addicts. The legalization of drugs would also make them much cheaper to buy. This would allow existing addicts to afford to buy bigger quantities of drugs and more powerful drugs. The increase in drug addicts, the increased availability of stronger, more dangerous drugs would be very dangerous to many addicts. The health risks to them are very high if drugs were legalized. The legalization of many dangerous unproven drugs is guaranteed to lead to more cases of overdoses, addictions, crimes caused by the effects of drugs, deaths from the effects of drugs and would lead to increases in drug use. These factors combined would lead to an increased burden for both the police force and the health service, and will allow gang and mafia culture to thrive. The amount of health service resources used on treating drug addictions, drug overdoses and health problems caused by long term drug use would either take away resources from other areas or lead to a need for significantly more funding for the health service. It is clear drugs are dangerous, addictive and cause premature death. They should not be legalized.	CON	285
Sf3406593-A83d47488	Abortion is murder and should not be allowed except in extreme cases.	Being careful is an unlikely option to prevent unplanned pregnancies. we being imperfect tend to make mistakes. Nobody sees the possibility of having an unplanned pregnancy when they are having sex that is why it is called an 'unplanned' pregnancy. when a woman gets pregnant, there are two options; she wants the baby or she doesn't want the baby. in the former, the choice is clear that she doesn't want the baby not a second longer and definely not for nine months, even if you stop her from having an abortion and talk to her about murdering an innocent life, she will kill the baby. her option clearly states the choice-- SHE DOESN'T WANT THE BABY. you cannot change someone choice on a matter because you think that what you think is right. You can only advise them, the choices they make are clearly their own. now that her choice is clear and you still want to stop her forcefully, she will hurt herself and cause a miscarrige. To protect her from hurting herself abortion is held. in the latter where she want to have the baby she can have it and later if financial problem arises she can opt to give her to foster care. when we talk about consequences of our deeds. the important thing in this whole argument is that the pregnancy is unplanned or sudden, you can talk all about innocent murder or inner self and karma but in the end it all narrows down to a choice. she doesn't want the baby. period. now all you can think is how to terminate it safetly without harming the mother. this theory about facing consequences of our deeds is just a thought, you cannot force it on someone. many tend to hide from these consequence or ignore them. people being independent do what they want to do. You cannot impose your thought on them. everyone has a different perception in life and that is what makes them different.

Sc351e266-Ae09f7889	The United States Federal Government should legalize prostitution.	"Thanks again to kasmic, and let's kick this debate off in style! I'll start by presenting my policy, which expands the system currently available in U.S. a state where prostitution is legal (Nevada) to all states by federal legislative means. This means that legal brothels will be opened and regulated like any other business, including wage laws, employment laws, and taxation. Brothels will be required to allocate a fair amount of money to their prostitutes rather than taking out a huge cut for themselves, as is currently the case. They will be required to have clean facilities, hire only adults, get their prostitutes tested regularly for STDs, and require the use of contraception to prevent the spread of disease and pregnancy. Now that that's out of the way, let's move into advantages. 1) Safety The reality is that prostitution is alive and well in this country, and that it will happen whether or not we do anything about it. That system, however, allows the widespread harms that currently exist for them, and as this encompasses as many as 2 million people, it's not a problem we can ignore. The women involved in this system are often so afraid to leave it due to abuse by their pimps that even those who find it untenable cannot leave.[1] Beyond that, many women are simply dependent upon the money they earn in this system as other job opportunities are not available to them, often because they have suffered so much abuse as children, including rape and incest, that they simply don't have the wherewithal to take on another job.[2] This means that we're currently forcing them into these abusive situations in order to survive. Enforcement is, itself, harmful. 62,668 people were arrested in 2010 are arrested each year for solicitation of sex, taking up valuable police time and crowding our prisons and jails at huge cost through both the trial and incarceration.[3] This isn't just a cost issue (more on that later). There are actually two substantial problems with this. The first is a lack of reporting actual crimes like rape and forced sex, both things that happen in the current system. In many countries, police are actually contributing to the problem, and police in the U.S. have actively shut down information services that would ameliorate the problem.[4, 5] The second is that the psychological implications go well beyond the duration of imprisonment. Whether we're talking about PTSD, diminished self-worth, severe difficulties with reintegration into society, social withdrawal, interpersonal distrust, or any of the many other documented psychological harms to prisoners, this is a tremendous problem, and one that leads to breaking down families and lives.[6] The law also consigns prostitution to being a criminal enterprise, which is the reason why things like human trafficking are such tremendous concerns "" an industry built on crime is not going to care if they add a few more illegal practices to the mix. A legal industry has a lot more to lose by engaging in blatantly illegal activities. Criminalization of prostitutes has actually done more harm than good, as ""anti-trafficking discussions on demand have historically been stymied by anti-prostitution efforts to eradicate the sex work sector by criminalizing clients,"" which means that these efforts have simply ""not reduced trafficking or sex work"".[7] Looking at STDs, even the World Health Organization advocates for decriminalization for the sake of public health.[8] Nevada has substantially lowered their prevalence and incidence, to the point that a job that's more broadly legalized, namely porn stars, are actually in worse shape than prostitutes.[9] Even decriminalization, a very basic response that is only the most basic part of my policy, has been effective in other states like Rhode Island at reducing STD rates, as well as rape.[10, 11] Please note that this isn't just a benefit for the prostitutes themselves "" sexual violence and STD incidence both decreased in the state population as a whole. Other studies have found that reduced homicide and rape rates country-wide are ""anti-correlated with the availability of prostitution. It is estimated that if prostitution were legalized in the United States, the rape rate would decrease by roughly 25% for a decrease of approximately 25,000 rapes per year.""[12] The protection from physical abuse is even stronger. There are fewer instances of violence, rape and disease in the Nevada system.[13] I solve for a great deal of this just by allowing prostitutes mobility out from under abusive pimps and johns, who are responsible for an average of 16 and 33 reported rapes per year, respectively.[14] 82% are physically assaulted, 83% are threatened with a weapon, and nearly 70% have been raped since becoming a prostitute.[15] If implemented on a country-wide basis, it's estimated that we would have 25,000 fewer rapes in this country.[14] Murder, which goes at 20 times the national average among prostitutes, would also be ameliorated by both regulation and dramatically improved reporting structures.[15, 16] All of these impacts to life loss and suffering are dramatic. 2) Justice There are a number of reasons why prostitution should be legal for the sake of justice. But in order to understand this, I first need to frame what a job is. Fundamentally, a job is a negotiated task agreed to by legally consenting individuals, usually involving some pay being given to the person completing the task. As adult human beings, we have the freedom to take on any number of jobs, ranging from the mundane and safe to the extraordinary and dangerous. And the only thing that gets in the way of any individual adult's ability to acquire these jobs is finding someone who will hire you for the purpose. I would say that the ability for these negotiations to proceed is itself a civil liberty. Human beings have a fundamental right to work, something that can easily be established by looking at international law. We can look to any number of sources. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states it plainly in Article 23.1.[17] The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is unequivocal as well, and this can be found in Part III, Article 6.[18] I think these all firmly establish the right to work quite clearly, and as long as this right exists, it must be extended to all adult, capable human beings. So what does it mean to deny this right? It's dehumanizing. Denying work to people who would otherwise be able to get it denies their agency as individuals. The law is currently engaging in this dehumanization, engaging in the unjust decision to illegalize a line of work that 1% of all American women have engaged in at some point in their lives.[9] Since this is an industry dominated by women, it's even more unjust, as it's a discriminatory practice that predominantly affects a single sex. 3) Costs This breaks down into 2 sources of cost savings included in my policy. A) Arrests, court and incarceration fees Taken together, these average roughly $2,000 per arrestee. For cities, this means an average of $7.5 million on prostitution, and taken country-wide, that cost adds up to roughly $200 million per year.[19, 20] While the costs of regulation replace some of these, those costs are already built into basic regulation systems already in place, and the cost of expanding them to a new industry are minimal by comparison. B) Taxation Prostitution is an $18 billion industry, and even if we assume 0 growth following legalization, the government stands to earn $6 billion in federal income taxes and $2 billion in licensing fees.[21] In both cases, the resulting finances are substantial. Most of the costs and bureaucracies of regulation, as in Nevada, are borne by the brothels themselves, creating a barrier to entry that also ensures that unsavory owners simply cannot even start in the industry.[22] But these costs aren't the only ones that affect the capacities of criminals to engage in basic harms like human trafficking. A black market keeps prices high. Legalization reduces the pricing schemes for prostitutes, mainly as a result of competition and increased availability.[23] As such, those engaging in human trafficking garner reduced compensation. results in much reduced revenue for human traffickers. This might seem like a small issue, but a human trafficker is doing it for the money, and it costs quite a bit to kidnap someone, hold them against their will, transport them over long distances, and keep them docile after they arrive. These are not small concerns, and these costs are actually enhanced by regulations that would screen many of these women regularly, regulate these brothels directly, and allow these women contact with police that doesn't result in their incarceration. All of these reduce the economic benefit of acquiring sex slaves, and thus reduce their value. All of this means the government is receiving billions in revenue and paying hundreds of millions fewer to boot. Those funds can be spent on better enforcement of human trafficking, more effective education systems and rehabilitation facilities to give these women more job options, better health care systems, the list of possible options is tremendous. Any of them is a more effective choice than a failed system of enforcement that drives prostitution underground, leading to pimps controlling law enforcement with sexual favors and feeding organized crime.[24, 25] Over to Con! 1. bit.ly/1yfSJuL 2. bit.ly/1E7wL4w 3. bit.ly/1CVL5rx 4. bit.ly/1G2q1Dj 5. bit.ly/1ITpOpo 6. 1.usa.gov/1FOkAu5 7. bit.ly/1ETll3H 8. bit.ly/1qLoOpK 9. huff.to/1E7wpLI 10. on.wsj.com/1n3kAx5 11. wapo.st/1G4iy9E 12. bit.ly/1xjgS8z 13. bit.ly/1EI2KU2 14. bit.ly/1Cfg4Ra 15. bit.ly/1xDkByi 16. bit.ly/19pV7YM 17. bit.ly/1bnFjmW 18. bit.ly/J1E1V3 19. bit.ly/1HO6Yzy 20. bit.ly/1BPdv4F 21. bit.ly/1FOjv5h 22. read.bi/1H2Rggx 23. ti.me/1cU8ICJ 24. bit.ly/1Bx22Yz 25. bit.ly/1m3Hllw"	PRO	288

The United States Federal Government: In this case, since we're referring to U.S. policy and what it allows for, we're necessarily referring to what should be done by the U.S. Legislature. To be clear, we're not talking about the political will for this to be done, but rather the positives and negatives of the legislature passing my proposed bill into law. Legalize: ""make (something that was previously illegal) permissible by law."" Prostitution: ""the practice or occupation of engaging in sexual activity with someone for payment."" This debate will have a total of 4 rounds.

S8c1650c4-A99651657	All drugs should be legalised, change my mind.	"Hello, I accept your debate. As I see you are a libertarian, I hope to at the very least offer you a different perspective on this topic. It may be worth mentioning I have known people that have taken drugs, dealt drugs, and been around them. Personally however, I admit I have never ran into them. So what is a drug? The word is a broad term. It could range from anything as trivial as caffeine, to something as detrimental as meth. However for the sake of this debate I will assume you mean detrimental drugs, as those are the ones kept illegal. Secondly, why do people take drugs? Well, typically, the way these addictions start off is due to people looking for escapism or a release, as they are dissatisfied with life. One they have taken these substances however, they easily become addicted, and find it hard to stop. Drug addiction is typically more widespread in poorer areas, thus it would be harder for the addicted individuals to find help to stop, or have people to reach out to. This leads onto my first point: keeping them illegal protects people from themselves. Now I do not believe in a nanny state; if someone""s stupid enough to leap off of a cliff, well, that""s natural selection; I don""t think we need signs telling people that it""s dangerous to jump off cliffs. But with drugs, it is often one mistake, and then a violent addiction is born out of it. Parents, teachers, officers of the law, they will all become a shadow of their former selves, as their life begins to revolve around one thing: getting high. Also, the addiction rate would, as you said, go up. But the people mostly at risk if they were to become legal would be adolescents. Teenagers are teenagers; we""re impulsive, and we like breaking rules and societal norms. So if drugs become legal, it won""t take much for teens to start doing them, thinking they""re the cool thing to do, or a way to rebel.

Sa799c6ee-A4dfb9c2a	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	"My opponent has not brought much new to the table here. A few more hardly relevant analogies, and more of the same assertions that legalizing and regulating the production, distribution, and use of all drugs will inevitably lead to a significant increase in users, addicts, and societal problems associated with drug use and abuse (assertions that are not backed up by a single source, case study, or real-world scenario). The analogy to the war on terror is even less relevant than the previous WWII analogy. While I disagree with many of the tactics used in the war on terrorism, combating terrorism is indeed a worthwhile endeavor for the simple fact that terrorists and terrorism, by their very definitions, cause harm to others. There is no way to legitimize the terrorism ""industry"" that will reduce the harm done by terrorist organizations. As I have already stated, legalization and regulation of the drug industry would immediately take control of the industry out of the hands of criminal organizations. My opponent has agreed that this is the case. This would obviously decrease the harm that these organizations and individuals can cause to others. I find the weed analogy to be not only irrelevant to the case at hand, but is also either extremely insensitive or extremely naive. Comparing the millions of lives ruined every year by the war on drugs to the eradication of weeds in his field? Really??? The battle against racial inequality is probably the most relevant analogy brought forth. However, the way that we combat racism is more akin to my proposal of legalization and regulation than it is to the current war on drugs. It is not illegal to be a racist. It is, however, illegal to use one's racism to cause harm to others. It should not be illegal for adults to use drugs. Obviously though, it should be illegal to engage in actions which potentially or actually harm others, either because of the effects of the drugs themselves (driving while intoxicated, physical assault, etc) or through actions taken to support drug use (burglaries, robberies, etc). The most effective weapon in the ""war on racism"" is education and public awareness. As I have previously stated, legalization of drugs needs to be coupled with factual education on the actual dangers of drug use. My opponent correctly states that tobacco and alcohol are the most widely used recreational drugs. He states that this is the case ""despite all of the known health risks and education programmes."" How has widespread education of the health risks affected the prevalence of the use of these drugs though? The current push to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco and alcohol did not really get started until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Prior to that, these products were heavily advertised (sometimes even endorsed by doctors), their use was prevalent in movies and TV (even in children's programming), and, especially regarding tobacco there were fewer restrictions on where they could be used. It wasn't all that long ago that one could smoke on airplanes, something that seems utterly ludicrous to most of us now. By every measure, and across all demographics, tobacco and alcohol use has dramatically and steadily decreased since the early 1980s. The most dramatic decrease in use of these drugs, especially in the last 15-20 years can be seen in high school age youth. A long-term study in the US found the following results among high school seniors (try as I might, I could not figure out how to import the graphs from this source, but I encourage everyone to follow the link provided): -1979 past month alcohol use---boys 7.5%, girls 6% -2010 past month alcohol use---boys 4.5%, girls 5% -1979 past month tobacco use---boys 3.8%, girls 3.9% -2010 past month tobacco use---boys 2.4%, girls 1.2% -1979 past month heavy alcohol use---boys 2%, girls 1% -2010 past month heavy alcohol use---boys 0.58%, girls 0.4% -1979 past month heavy tobacco use---boys 1.1%, girls 0.9% -2010 past month heavy tobacco use---boys 0.25%, girls 0.2% [1] [1] SOURCE---(http://www.demographic-research.org...) My opponent's assertion that legal sanctions against even casual drug users are necessary to deter drug use has not been demonstrated. In fact, even the harshest of sanctions, the death penalty, has not deterred drug traffickers or users in some countries. Furthermore, some people, especially impressionable and defiant youths are actually tempted to use drugs BECAUSE of their illicit nature. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse with experience in addictions and recovery. I have heard this directly from addicts. The deterrent vs enticement of keeping drugs illegal is probably a push. On the other hand, education on the risks of drug use coupled with strict regulations on use HAS been successful in decreasing drug use. This is evidenced by the increase in education and regulations and subsequent decrease in alcohol and tobacco use in the last 35 years. It has also been demonstrated, in Portugal and elsewhere, that removing the threat of legal sanctions against addicts leads to more addicts seeking treatment (double, in the case of Portugal), without the corresponding increase in long term casual users OR addicts. As previously mentioned, Portugal's current rate of increase of casual users is on par with the rest of the EU. Couple that with the fact that 8,000 fewer people are facing drug charges every year, and that is, by any measure an increase in overall benefit to Portuguese society. The same rate of increase among adults, a decrease in the number of young users, twice as many addicts receiving treatment, greatly reduced court costs, and 8,000 people per year not receiving criminal charges. How could that be seen as anything but a resounding success? And all that while still leaving organized crime in charge of production and distribution. As I have already stated, and as America's failed attempt at alcohol prohibition has demonstrated, the government, even at current levels of incompetence and corruption, is a far better choice for regulating the drug industry than the mafia, cartels, and street gangs. A return to alcohol prohibition, something my opponent would like to see happen, would once again completely deregulate the alcohol industry. The same people who control the illicit trade of hard drugs today would be in control of the industry and would play by the same rules. Did we, as a society learn nothing the first time around? As harmful as many drugs are, and alcohol is one of the worst, they will always be with us and someone will always set the rules of conduct for the drug industry. The question is, who is better suited to setting and enforcing those rules; the government or organized crime? I think it is clear where we both stand on that issue. Some might view a doubling of addicts in treatment in Portugal as an alarming indictment of legalization/decriminalization (it shouldn't be alarming since, as i mentioned, there was not a corresponding increase in reported use or addiction). For that reason, let us look at treatment vs incarceration. Treatment is not only more effective at combating addiction than is incarceration, it is also much more cost effective and allows for resources to be utilized elsewhere. It has even been shown that in-patient treatment for addicted offenders is more effective at reducing recidivism and re-offend rates than treatment programs coupled with jail time, and immeasurably more effective than jail time alone. In New York State, a study found that the cost of out of prison treatment runs around $2,000-$7,000. Incarceration for 25 months (the average sentence for drug offenders) is $64,000. Even the intensive 15-24 month Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison (DTAP) program costs $33,000, around half the cost of prison. Treatment inside prison adds $24/day to the cost of incarceration and is less effective. Recidivism rates for those receiving in-patient treatment dropped 16.7%. For those receiving treatment in prison, the decrease in recidivism was only 4.5-5.7%. A federal report in the US showed that ""after completing a treatment program, the percentage of offenders arrested for drug charges went down by 51%, overall arrests declined by 64%, and 70-90% saw reductions in criminal behavior."" [2] Treatment also saves lives, while incarceration destroys them. [2] SOURCE---(https://beyondorange.wordpress.com...) One question that has only briefly been touched upon in this debate is: Do adult human beings require the government to be their nanny? Phrased another way, should properly informed adults be free to make their own choices so long as their choices do not harm others? I would love to explore the personal freedom/responsibility aspect of the argument in greater detail, but alas I am quickly approaching my character limit, so I must keep it short. My opponent clearly believes that adults do in fact require a nanny to protect them not only from each other, but from themselves. What he fails to realize is that by ""protecting"" its citizens from themselves, the government is essentially throwing them to the wolves. If the government does not oversee and regulate the production, distribution, and use of potentially harmful drugs, someone else will; and that someone is inevitably an even more corrupt organization which operates without rules and regard for human lives (or term limits). My opponent would prefer drugs to remain illegal ""for the people."" And while I do not doubt his good intentions, what he doesn't see is that the war against drugs that he supports is really a war ""against the people."" I'd like to thank beng100 for engaging me in this interesting, entertaining, and civil discussion. May the best argument win."	PRO	291
S1304ecba-Ae545d699	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"== Rebuttal == General responses: Plan flaw: state vs. federal The topic says the U.S. Federal Government should legalize child porn, so Wylted's plan would only legalize child porn at the national level. However, child porn is also illegal at the state level. Every single state (except Alabama) separately criminalizes child porn. [1] This takes out 98.5% of Wylted's solvency because child porn would still be illegal for 98.5% of the U.S. population, who could not view child porn without being subject to prosecution on the state-level. There are two implications to this argument. (1) Wylted should lose the debate because he fails to uphold his burden to prove solvency. As a policymaker, if you offer a proposal to solve a problem, you have the burden to show that your plan actually solves that problem. Legislatures should not waste time debating and passing proposals that do *nothing* (because of limited legislative resources). Any political capital spent passing Wylted's proposal would be wasted and would be better spent on other things (like dealing with our nation's ballooning student loan debt). (2) Legalization at the federal level misleads people into thinking child porn is ""legal"" and leads otherwise law-abiding citizens to mistakenly break state law. Wylted himself (in Round 1) says that child porn should be placed on the *FBI""s homepage* for easy access. Yet anyone who accesses said child porn in any state except Alabama would be breaking *state* law and would be subject to criminal prosecution (plus a lifetime on a sex offender registry). You could see how even an ordinary citizen might click on the child porn on the *FBI""s homepage* merely out of curiosity (and due the novelty of the federal government seemingly *endorsing* child porn), but this person could wind up in jail for doing so under state law. Thus, there is a huge disadvantage that stems from this plan flaw. Disadvantage 2: Active endorsement Furthermore, putting child porn on the FBI website is a bad idea because it looks like an active endorsement or even encouragement of child porn by the federal government. It's one thing to legalize something and another to endorse it. Some countries have legalized -- or at least decriminalized -- drugs, but that doesn""t mean those countries hand out free drugs in their capitol buildings. Likewise, the federal government should not hand out free child porn on the FBI website. You should vote Wylted down for this proposal alone. Endorsement by the government would ""normalize"" child porn. The social stigma against viewing child porn is *good* because it motivates some pedophiles to seek help for their urges. Counterplan: decriminalize, don't legalize Based on the drug law context, the difference between a ""decriminalization"" and a ""legalization"" regime is that decriminalization would still keep the law on the books that makes child porn ""unlawful,"" but it would eliminate the criminal sanctions for *possession* (specifically jail time). Instead, violation of the law would result in a ""civil"" penalty, such as mandated therapy. This is how drug-decriminalization regimes operate. [2] Decriminalization would make it more permissible for pedophiles to admit to viewing child porn (because they are no longer admitting to a ""crime""), thus making it easier for them to seek treatment and to be candid with therapists. In contrast, legalization makes the viewing of child porn *completely* legal and eliminates some of the stigma related to having the urge to f*ck children. As already mentioned, this stigma is good because it motivates some pedophiles to seek treatment. The counterplan thus captures much of the net benefits of Wylted's plan, without the major disadvantages stemming from having the federal government endorse and normalize child porn. Mikal and I are allowed to make this argument because under ""negation theory,"" we only need to prove that we should *not* legalize child porn. It doesn't matter how we do so. If we win that there are better options *or* we win that it should remain illegal, we prove that legalization is ""bad policy."" == Resolutional Analysis == Wylted claims that production of child porn would remain illegal in his regime (since children cannot consent). However, this isn""t ""legalizing"" child porn. It is more akin to ""decriminalizing"" it. If we ""legalized"" drugs, for example, both production and possession would be legal. In contrast, ""decriminalization"" of drugs only affects possession (not production). Therefore, Wylted is really only arguing for decriminalization [a Neg position] unless he argues that *production* should be legal. Disadvantage 3: Incentivizing production Wylted claims that if child porn were legalized, you still couldn't sell it. I don't see why not. But even if you had to give it away for free, you could still profit from using it to direct traffic to your website (to generate more ad revenue). Therefore, legalization incentives people to produce *more* child porn. There are examples of parents taking naked photos of their children to sell to pedophiles. [2, Rd 2] Wylted's plan thus makes it more likely that people will exploit children to produce child porn. Line-by-line rebuttal R1) ""Justice"" //A// Wylted""s study (which used data since 1989) was already refuted last round. //B// Wylted says that it's unfair that child molesters get an average sentence of four years, compared to seven years for child porn. However, this disparity represents problems of *proof.* The prosecution has a hard time proving actual molestation (because children are unpredictable on the witness stand, if they agree to testify at all), so prosecutors are more likely to offer lenient plea bargains in molestation cases to avoid trial. In contrast, child porn charges are easy to prove. If your computer is seized and you have child porn on it, you don""t have much of a defense, so you don't get a good plea deal. In addition, the high correlation between viewing child porn and molestation means that harsher sentences for viewing child porn are *good* because they keep molesters off the streets. Under subpoint B, Wlyted also claims that people only produce child porn to ""document"" their crimes. However, the sources I linked last round (about specific parents producing child porn in order to sell it to pedophiles) proves that people *also* do it for financial reasons. //C// Wytled discusses under subpoint C that child porn laws result in the children themselves being put in jail. This problem is taken care of by the exceptions Mikal and I provided last round. R2) Free speech Wylted claims that producing child porn is a type of free speech that should be protected by the First Amendment. However, speech can be regulated when there is a countervailing government interest, such as protecting people. For example, free speech doesn't protect your right to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater (when there is no fire) because doing so would endanger people. Likewise, hate speech is prohibited because it is likely to incite a violent response. Child porn can be regulated because the government has an interest in protecting children (as the Supreme Court explained in New York v. Ferber). And the Supreme Court's word on the Constitution is final. Child porn laws are not a First Amendment violation. R3) Wasted resources First of all, you can never vote for this contention because Wylted does not quantify how many police resources are ""wasted"" on prosecuting child porn offenses. For all we know, it takes relatively few resources to police this crime. A lot of the child porn cases you will read in law school involve someone's wife or girlfriend finding child porn on his computer and turning him in. This takes few resources. Second, to the extent that there is a very high correlation between viewing child porn and actual molestation, spending resources on prosecuting child porn offenders is *good* because it gets a lot of actual molesters off the streets. Third, prosecutorial discretion solves better. Prosecutors get to choose which cases to bring, and *most* prosecutors exercise good judgment. If some random lonely fat guy just happened to accidentally download one image of a 17-year old, you'd be hard pressed to find a prosecutor that would be willing to bring that case. Because prosecutors won't take silly cases, police generally don't pursue them. I challenge Wylted to show, for example, that it is common for nudists to be prosecuted for posting pictures of their nudist children on Facebook. == Rebuttal to Round 3 == We'll save most of our rebuttals here for next round, but let's address the ""studies debate."" Wylted questions the methodology of the Butner study by saying that child porn offenders were expelled from the treatment program if they refused to enumerate victims. However, this simply isn't true, but rather is a highly publicized myth (that seems to have convinced one judge). But not a single person was expelled from the program for refusing to list victims. [3] In fact, 15 percent of the study sample completed the treatment program and never listed any victims at all. [3] In addition, the Butner study is not the only one to find such a high correlation. Here""s another study that found that, based on their scores on an ""antisocial behavior scale,"" internet porn viewers had between a 27 percent and 84 percent chance of also being a molester. [4] Wylted cites a meta-study saying that only 2.1 percent of child porn viewers sexually recidivate. However, this is extremely misleading because it is a ""three year"" recidivism rate, meaning it only follows offenders for three years after release. People convicted of *child molestation* have a comparably low three-year recidivism rate of 3.3 percent. [5] However, the *lifetime* recidivism rate for child molesters is 52 percent. [6] If you looked at the *lifetime* recidivism rate for child porn viewers, the rate would also be much higher. The reason most people don""t re-offend so soon after release is because they are on *supervised* release (parole), so it is hard to get away with anything. [1] http://tinyurl.com...

S42f970a3-Aad7dd93a	Cigarettes Should be Illegal	"Food: I think my opponent has essentially agreed with my assertion that banning fast food or unhealthy eating habits is impractical, while banning cigarette smoking is not. His food comparison example's effectiveness thus goes away. Health care: Again, this is my opponent's example. Anti-abortionists are not forced to pay for abortions. The recent health care bill that was passed leaves abortions out of federally funded health care programs. My objection still stands that it's unfair for non-smokers to have to pay billions of dollars for a habit that they do not engage in. If we legalized cocaine, others would have to pay for the productivity/health care costs of increased cocaine addiction. Proving we sometimes pay for things we don't do is not a good justification for legality. Marketing to kids: I agree it is illegal to market to kids, which is why cigarette advertisers claim to be marketing to adults. But kids still see the advertisements. And remember, two University of Arizona marketing professors conducted a study that found that ""each time a child saw an advertisement that appeared to promote a particular cigarette brand, the likelihood of being susceptible to smoking grew by 182 percent."" Banning cigarettes would make it illegal to advertise them. My opponent points out that children also start smoking because of peer pressure. Two responses: 1) Remember the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that kids are influenced more by cigarette advertising than by peer pressure. 2) A lot of peer pressure happens older to younger, meaning an 18 year old, who can now legally purchase cigarettes, pressuring someone younger than him to start smoking. Illegality makes peer pressure more difficult. My opponent objects on moral grounds to banning something simply because it is advertised to children. I agree. Cigarettes should not be banned merely because they are marketed to kids, but for all the other reasons I've stated. My point here is more to show that the ""choice"" to smoke is not as simple a choice as my opponent makes it sound. Many people (90%) get hooked as children when they think smoking is really cool, and they are less likely to worry about their health. They then find it hard to quit. Remember the Gallup poll that 3 out of 4 smokers want to quit but feel that they can't because cigarettes are too addictive. Secondhand smoke I agree with my opponent that compromises have been made, but I showed before that 50% of people in the United States are uncovered by many of these compromise laws. I also know that smokers don't intentionally blow smoke in non-smokers faces, but if a smoker is jonesing for a cigarette at a bus stop, he often times will light up, forcing those around him to inhale secondhand smoke (this has happened to me). It's not deliberate, but it happens. If some people smoked illegally, they definitely would no longer do it around other people, for risk of being caught. Illegality solves secondhand smoke. Addictiveness: I give my opponent props for caffeine – I forgot about that one somehow. Alcohol is addictive only if you're an alcoholic, which is a very small minority of drinkers. Smoking, in contrast, is addictive to all regular smokers. People may crave sugar if they stop eating it, but their bodies do not start shaking uncontrollably. My main response to caffeine is: when 3 of 4 caffeine users say they want to quit, but feel they can't, I'd consider banning it. And bad caffeine withdrawal only occurs with a minority of caffeine drinkers who consume over 3 cups of coffee a day. Right to smoke: My opponent concedes this point by saying ""No, people do not have the right to do heroin. That right is denied by the government."" That was my point in bringing up heroin. You can claim to have a right to do anything, but when the government calculates that something does more harm than good to society, it can deny one of those ""rights,"" especially when those rights conflict with other people's rights. Prohibition: My opponent does not answer any of my analysis that Prohibition Era backlash was because the vast majority of drinkers did not want to quit drinking. However, the vast majority of smokers do (3 out of 4). The response to a smoking ban would likely be that 75% of smokers would quit immediately, rather than seeking out illegal means of procuring cigarettes. Even many people who did not want to quit likely would, rather than seeking out illegal cigarette dealers. Prohibition's underground bars only worked because 70% of the U.S. population supported them. Also, keep in mind that unlike alcohol, which is usually consumed once a day, at night, inside a building, cigarettes are usually consumed multiple times a day, outside. It is much harder to hide from the authorities. Most people would quit when they realized they can't smoke during the day, like at work, for fear of being caught. My opponent points out that people can choose to quit. I would assert that it's not as easy as he makes it sound. The fact that he cites a forum where people who are trying to quit congregate and help each other proves how difficult quitting actually is. If it were easy, no such forum would be necessary. $7.18 The fact that we waste tax dollars sometimes does not answer this argument because 1) we shouldn't waste tax dollars and 2) tax dollars are not a part of the $7.18 that society pays per pack. We lose that money because smokers take extra sick days, which hurts our nation's productivity and makes our GDP growth rate lower, and because smokers force up health care costs, which means we pay more to our insurance companies in the form of monthly premiums. Those two costs add up to $157 billion a year, which amounts to $7.18 per pack purchased. My opponent must mis-cite his source (his #4), because I can't find any reference to tax dollars, but I also assume that $157 billion a year is much more than what he is referencing. Tax revenue: since smoking only generates $2 billion in sales (as my opponent has stated), the tax revenue gained would only be a tiny fraction of that $2 billion, mostly around 8% of it (sales tax). The $157 billion a year our society loses is still going to outweigh the pittance we collect in cigarette taxes. Because we can no longer look at this from a moral perspective, since my opponent agrees that society can take away the right to smoke much as it has taken away the right to do heroin, that leaves the practical implications. A ban would help smokers quit, considering that three-fourths of smokers want to quit. A ban would save our country $157 billion a year by making our economy more productive and lowering health care costs. A ban would solve the secondhand smoke problem. And a ban would end the unfair negative externality (the cost imposed by the few on the many, since they do not have to pay for it) of $7.18 per pack of cigarettes."	PRO	293

Sc99e004-A5d920140	Empathy should have no role in judging appeals	"If empathy should have a role in judging appeals, then Con should tell us what role it should have. Con tells us, ""The interpretation of the broad language in the Constitution reflects the values of the judges, as there isn't always a definitive right and wrong."" Con gives the example of interpreting ""cruel and unusual punishment"" as an example of when empathy should be used to render a decision. The are several alternatives to the judge using his own feels of what is ""cruel and unusual."" The judge might rely upon the original concept of cruel and unusual, under the strict constructionist legal theory that changes from original intent ought to be embodied in amendments, as provided for in the Constitution as the authorized way to change meaning. However, under the ""living document"" legal theory, the judge could rely upon what the consensus of state legislatures takes to be cruel and unusual. There is no prohibition against states having more restrictive standards than the Constitution allows. An alternative, also under ""living document"" legal theory, would to rely upon polls of the opinions of citizens as to what ""cruel and unusual"" means today. Neither of the alternative living document theories rely up how the judge himself empathizes with parties in the case, but rather upon objective assessments majority sentiment. Con would have none of that. He wants the judge's personal feeling to come into play. If empathy has a role in appeals decisions, then that role will move the decision one way or the other based on the judge's feelings. Con seems to assume that the judge will always feel the way Con does, but legitimizing the practice does not provide any guarantees of the outcome. In another example, Con argues that the Court should feel sorry for the girl who was searched and rule in her favor even if the legal factors would otherwise have made the ruling go the other way. But if a justice happened to empathize with the school administration trying to keep order in an unruly school, a notion that empathy should play a role allows any decision dictated by the jurist's feelings. A written opinion would have to say, ""The law was close so I went with my feelings."" That's unacceptable. In the case of the girl being searched, we should want the judge to consider the Fourth Amendment, the Ninth amendment, and other legal factors involved in order to make a decision based upon law. If it is unclear, then he can use one of the methods of the law I cited to arrive at a decision. If he takes the living document approach, the judge could survey state laws regard student searches or even public opinion polls. He should never make law based upon his feelings. Con points out that the Supreme court has original jurisdiction in some cases. It doesn't matter whether or not the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in some cases or not. The resolution deals only with 'judging appeals."" In any case, it seems unlikely in any case that empathy would enter into decisions involving states. Imagine a judge writing, ""I voted for Alaska in this case. They are such a cold state, I felt really sorry ..."" That's not likely. Con argued that cases are ""often"" close. The implication is that judging according to law is rarely adequate, so empathy ought to be the tipping point. In the worst year in decades, 2007, 5-4 decisions occurred in about a third of cases. It dropped last year. Most of the time liberal and conservative justices rule consistently based on the law. I argued that if interpretation of the law was unclear, then there were at least five methods within the bounds of law that could be used to decide close cases. Even if one wants to reinterpret the Constitution yearly, the empathetic expressions of the States and of the public can be used rather than personal empathy. Con's rebuttal was to attack each method as being inapplicable in some cases. However, that does not mean that relying on empathy is a better method. A judge not ought rule that ""the precedents seem inapplicable, so I went with my feelings."" For example, the method of constructing an analogy with precedent is always applicable. Every new case is most like *some* previous case, even if it is not identical to some previous case. The point is that the judge should use one or more of the methods within law, rather than empathy. Con argues that not all laws that he believes are bad will be overturned by legislatures, and that some bad laws would be overturned more quickly by courts than legislatures. The question, then, is whose empathy should prevail and how quickly. Keep in mind that empathy is subjective. If when voters act they do not do what Con wants, it is not an argument for an empathetic court. Perhaps the court will not share Con's opinion of who deserves the most understanding. To accept empathy as a factor, Con must agree to always accept the subjective judgments of the Court no matter which way they cut. Court decisions are much more difficult to reverse than legislative decisions. It's far better to let voters and legislatures struggle with the issues than to give judges free play with their feelings. It's true that judges can act faster than legislators. Authoritarian rule has the advantage of speed. Kim Jung Il has never had to suffer the frustrating delays of getting voter concurrence. The whole system of checks and balances, the three branches of government, and the bicameral legislature are all designed by the Constitution to favor democracy and deliberation over speed. Upsetting that on the basis of the feelings of judges would be a great mistake. Con claims that the Brown v. Board of Education was decided based upon empathy, but Con offers no evidence in support of that view. It was definitely not one of those 5-4 decisions where an empathic judge tipped the scales. ""Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court's unanimous (9-0) decision stated that 'separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.' "" Brown v. Board of Education was decided based upon direct reading of law, the 14th Amendment in particular. If the Constitution demands overthrow of a lower court ruling, it ought to be implemented right away. Direct reading of law can always overcome precedent. My list of ways to decide close cases assumes that the law was not the determining factor, so some other method within the bounds of law, like precedent, should be used. In arguing Griswold, I noted that my argument only applied if the decision to overthrow the law was not based upon empathy. It is the job of the Court to invalidate laws that are unconstitutional. On that basis we nonetheless expect some close decisions. I used Griswold to point out that it would be wrong for a court to use their personal feelings to make law. If a law is Constitutional and factors of empathy are compelling, then the legislature or the voters will see to it that the law is changed. If the empathy is not compelling then the law will not be rescinded. Con wants the empathy of judges to short-circuit the legislative process. Con claims, ""The law is not black and white, as Pro would like it to be."" If I thought the law was black and white I would not have listed five methods within the law by which gray areas of the law could be resolved without the judge using his feelings to force the outcome. Appeals cases deal solely with questions of law and should rely upon law and legal theories that deal with questions of law. Even under the legal theory of the Constitution being interpreted as a living document, it should not be the judge's personal feelings that guide interpretation, but rather the objective consideration of the sentiment of the nation. Allowing empathy of judges to play a role may not get the results one wants; recall that President George H.W. Bush though David Souter would be a conservative justice. The resolution is affirmed."

S776ec737-A2d40c8d2	Random drug testing should not be used in public schools.	"My opponent started out talking about voluntary extracurricular activities as opposed to students in general but I'm not sure anymore. I will argue both sides. Drug testing is good since it supports the economy by providing a lot of useless jobs with money that would be better spent elsewhere anyway but mainly keeps those protesters in jail where they belong. My rant from another debate: http://www.debate.org... Freedom. Let's start with China. Students and teachers were locked down for over an hour while police dogs searched for drugs without any probable cause. Since no drugs were found, this ""drill"" was a great success, the government claimed. It gave the police dogs a good experience with real-life situations. We already know how the Chinese are about drugs and freedom anyway so this is not really surprising. One wonders why it is even in the news. We have problems of our own after all. http://www.freedomsphoenix.com... Except it wasn't China. It was Arizona. And also participating were the people who run private prisons just in case this turned into more than a ""drill."" They want more ""clients."" Might as well take them straight to the Big House and eliminate the middle man with all that legal fuss anyway. You know that's where you are going and they are not going to bring the prison to you. They have an excellent escape plan since they want you to bring all your friends back with you when you return. That means more profits. We already know how Arizona is about drugs and freedom anyway so this is not really surprising. One wonders why it is even in the news. We have problems of our own after all.

Sa799c6ee-A39a21868	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	It was clear Great Britain could not win the second world war when for a short time it was alone in fighting the mighty strength that was Nazi Germany. According to your logic Britain should have accepted defeat as no way it could win the war existed. Hitler's astonishing new blitzkrieg strategy had shocked Britain's European allies into quick humiliating defeats. Nazi Germany had considerable military advantages. The only thing Britain had going for it was a strong navy and a sea boundary between itself and Nazi controlled France. Germany launched a heavy aeriel bombardment of bombs on Britain to weaken its resolve and hope to pressurize it into surrendering or damage its air force to the extent a potential German invasion force could cross the channel without being fired at from the air. Despite its perilous position Britain and its leader Winston Churchill fought on, despite seemingly hopeless circumstances. As time passed Hitler became impatient with the war with Britain and naively chose to invade the USSR. This while initially successful was ultimately a foolish decision as it led to a war on 2 fronts, stretching supplies, troops, weaponry and equipment over too large an area. This gave Britain a lifeline to survive and as the war progressed the entry of the USA decisively turned things in favour of the free world. If Britain had surrendered western Europe would have either stayed in Nazi control or come under communist control. When something is wrong you have to keep fighting. You cannot simply give up and allow evil to prevail, just because you can't win. The reasons why the countries you mention that execute numerous people for drug offences still have major drug problems are numerous. The main issue is clearly corruption. The biggest drug lords can buy their way out of trouble, often using vulnerable people as mules to traffic drugs. Often the people executed or imprisoned for drug offences are not the people really responsible for the offence. Action needs to be taken against drug lords but unfortunately corruption is rife in many areas and the power these gangs hold scares law enforcement from getting to the root of the problem. The general lack of effective government control, especially in the south american countries sees gangs and militias controlling areas where production of drugs and growing drugs is the norm. These countries offer favourable climatic conditions for growing drugs and for local farmers growing drugs offers by far the best source of income. Drugs are a huge problem in central and south America. Corruption, poor law enforcement and weak government control are to blame. My opponent makes a series of claims that Portugal is a good example for how decriminalization of drugs can have a positive effect on reducing drug use. However a key flaw in this argument exists. Portugal decriminalize drug possession. It did not decriminalize drug dealing nor did it as you suggest legalize and regulate the production and distribution of potentially harmful substances. This is a key difference to what Portugal has done. What you are suggesting is that products such as Heroin, Crystal Meth and Cocaine can be picked up off supermarket shelves and placed in trolleys or picked up from the selection in front of the till in a newsagents. This is not happening in Portugal. Children and vulnerable young adults are not seeing these substances in every shop and assuming they are perfectly normal substances to take in the same way tobacco and alcohol are viewed. Education about the dangers of tobacco and alcohol are common place yet considerable numbers of young people choose to use these substances. This is because they are legal, can be brought easily in conventional stores and are viewed as normal by society. My opponents suggestion to legalize and regulate drug production and distribution would normalize many dangerous substances. This would cause increases in drug use, drug addictions, drug overdoses, crimes committed by people under the influence of drugs, drug related health problems and drug related deaths. This would create a huge healthcare burden from treating harmful physical health problems caused by dangerous substances and for treating drug addictions and mental health problems caused by drugs.

S8712369-Acbf4f697	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	"I thank my opponent for a very speedy response. This round I will attempt to address my opponent's Opening arguments and then move on to his refutations of my own. Before I go into my rebuttals I would like to point out a few things that my opponent is advocating here. In R1 he advocated that he would ""in some cases"" permit Involuntary Euthanasia. Now what's Involuntary Euthanasia you might ask? Let me define it for you. Involuntary Euthanasia- Involuntary euthanasia occurs when euthanasia is performed on a person who is able to provide informed consent, but does not, either because they do not choose to die, or because they were not asked. [1] Now I don't know about you, but this ""in some cases"" sounds like actual murder since this is done without the persons consent or even against their will. My opponent states that I do not know what I'm debating, but this is one of the things that he is advocating and is one of the things I warned about in my framework. The second type of euthanasia that my opponent argues for (outside of voluntary euthanasia) is non-voluntary euthanasia- Non-voluntary euthanasia (sometimes known as mercy killing) is euthanasia conducted where the explicit consent of the individual concerned is unavailable, such as when the person is in a persistent vegetative state, or in the case of young children. [2] Rebuttal 1: Resource Delegation My opponent's argument here is completely invalid as he has made one of the most common mistakes. Physican Assisted Sucide is not the same as Voluntary Euthanasia. PAS is when the doctor provides the materials to kill the patient while in Euthanasia the Doctor actually kills the patient. [3] This is a completely different thing so this argument must be thrown out of the debate since it is an untopical argument. As for the costs, this is a National Healthcare issue. The International ask Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide reported that when making the drugs for Euthanasia it costs more than it does for the medical treatment of keeping the patient alive. [4] This is a key thing as it shows that this argument from my opponent is really just an argument in my own favor. Rebuttal 2: Quality over Quantity ""Activists often claim that laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are government mandated suffering. But this claim would be similar to saying that laws against selling contaminated food are government mandated starvation. Laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are in place to prevent abuse and to protect people from unscrupulous doctors and others. They are not, and never have been, intended to make anyone suffer."" [4] As we can see from the quote above my opponent is simply misunderstanding the law that is in place. The laws aren't meant to make people suffer. That's like saying that FDA regulations against certain foods are intended to make people starve. The laws against Euthanasia are proper regulations to ensure and protect against abuse. Rebuttal 3: It is possible to Regulate Euthanasia I find it quite interesting that my opponent brings up the ""Death with Dignity Act."" The reason being is that the law has absolutely nothing to do with Euthanasia. You heard me right, it has nothing to do with euthanasia, but is actually PAS. Let me give you a direct quote from Oregon's Department of Human Services, "" The Death with Dignity Act legalizes PAS [physician-assisted suicide], but specifically prohibits euthanasia, where a physician or other person directly administers a medication to end another's life."" [5] So we can now officially see that there really isn't any legal forms of euthanasia in the US and by my opponent's own words and standards stated in Round 3, we would be unable to actually know how it would impact the US without it here. Though if we are to regulate how is that possible with my opponent allowing involuntary euthanasia which is pratically murder? “Globally speaking, people do develop intolerance to morphine, and delirium is very common at the end of life”[6], as we can see here in a quote by Palliative Specialist Dr. BJ Miller, that delirium is common towards the end of life and at this point the person has no idea what they are doing, but may appear as they do. This is harmful at this time as they may chose to permit Voluntary Euthanasia, but they might not actually want to do so in the correct state of mind. So even with Pro's ""regulations"" we won't be able to actually be able to properly help them, but kill them. Rebuttal 4: Euthanasia already happens. My opponent makes an interesting argument when he brings in Passive Euthanasia. Though I will continue with my argument from Dr. BJ Miller on that people are in capable at making these kinds of decissions at which point we should not permitt others to preform euthanasia since it would normally be against he person's wishes. I also extend across my arguments from last round that highlight the importance of seeing a Palliative Specialist which these cases have dropped to miniscual numbers. This is important as it helps evaluate the patient and their state. Euthanasia skips over the Palliative Specialist and has the doctor kill the patient at command. Now with that out of the way is is time to move on to my opponent's Round 3 arguments. Framework My opponent goes throughout here and just states that everything is blasphamous, but it is not so. I have shown that in each of these situations that an invention meant for good things are turned into a weapon of terror against the people. My opponent claims what Hitler did wasn't Euthanasia, but keep in mind Hitler was simply doing Involuntary euthanasia, which is something my opponent is advocating for, and nonvoluntary euthanasia. Note that I'm not talking about the Holicost as this is pre-Holicost. My opponent launches into an Ad Hom attack into Lois Lowry and must be discarded as he doesn't actually refute the argument made here. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia. My opponent pratically discards this argument since it is from another country, but here we have to keep two things in mind. A) Europe is a more liberal place and with this policy in a movement towards a more liberal policy we can see Europe as an almost model to compare to. B) The US hasn't legalized Euthanasia only PAS. Europe actually has and studying these cases is important since they are the only places that have and make a similar path that the US would follow. Secondly we have to remember that my opponent's continued disgust of Involuntary euthanasia contradicts his R1 claim and with him arguing against himself it will immidiately flow the debate into my favor. Contention 2: The Slippery Slope Argument My opponent continues to ignore the fact that the killing of children in this case is euthanasia. If you look at the types of euthanasia definitions that I have provided you'll see that the killing of children is indeed in one of them showing that it is indeed Euthanasia. Though this contention is named the ""Slippery Slope Argument"" does not truely mean that it is a Slippery Slope Fallacy. The reason for this is that I have provided a great deal of evidence that shows that this does and will happen. With Europe ahead of us and being the only nations that have done so chances are that it will happen in the US. Not to mention that our moral values and our policies are moving more towards liberal Europe's views. The doctor is meant to cure and help heal patients not kill them. It is an entire different story. My opponent is bringing up a rediculious argument as it shows the direct opposite of what the doctor is suppose to do. There's a complete difference between preforming heart surgery and pushing the suringe on a need injecting posion into a patients IV to preform euthanasia and kill them. My opponent doesn't tell you all of the moral compass quote. The rest talks about prescribing them a drug that they can possibly overdose on. It says nothing about lethal injections or anything of that nature. That's like me telling you to swallow an entire bottle of Sleeping pills. There's a ton of things that are nearly irrelivant with my opponent's argument here. Contention 3: Self-Ownership and Sickness My opponent here talks about that he's not for this type of Euthanasia, but yet he is defending Non-Voluntary Euthanasia and this is something that is including in this relm and thus he has no choice, but to go and defend this point as this falls under the umbrella that my opponent set-up for his argumenation. Though I feel for those in pain and I'm not as heartless as my opponent thinks I am there is such a thing as a rational mind. I would go much more indepth here, but I'm running out of character. Immanual Kant states that all humans are Rational beings, but when there is injury or pain this blocks our cognative and state of mind. This puts us in a temporary state of Irrationality. [7] Due to this improperstate of mind we cannot permitt them to make these massive decissions. My opponent makes a mistake with my quote. We must observe that the person, in a Rational state of mind would never choose death, but due to this imparement of Rationality we cannot allow them to take their lives since they are not in the correct state of mind. That is respecting the rights of the individual. The community needs the person due to the their contrabution and if the individual takes their life then the entire community will feel it.

Sc99e004-Ab6455c0c	Empathy should have no role in judging appeals	"My argument is going to primarily focus on your claim that we should want judge who reach decisions solely based upon the law, not feelings. About 10,000 cases are submitted to the Supreme Court of the United States each year. The Supreme Court only hears 100 cases on average per year, or this has been the case recently. ""Formal written opinions are delivered in 80 to 90 cases"" ( http://www.supremecourtus.gov... ). I think it's abundantly clear that it's very difficult for a case to make it to the Supreme Court. Most of the cases that make it to the Supreme Court rarely involve a clear right or wrong answer. Many rulings are complex. Some have little basis in law. Some have a lot of basis in law. But it's obvious that the Constitution does not address every issue that comes to the Supreme Court. The Constitution also includes phrases, which will be interpreted differently by different people, like ""due process of law"", ""just compensation"", ""cruel and unusual punishment"", or ""equal protection of the law"", just to give a few examples. These phrases are not explicitly defined. As you and I both know, Marbury v. Madison set the precedent for judicial review. As a result, the Supreme Court has reviewed many laws over the years and ruled over their constitutionality. Over the years, there have been many close decisions. Just last year, D.C. v. Heller was decided 5-4. Boumediene v. Bush was decided 5-4. I can go on with other close decisions. This observation gives heavy support to the claim that most cases rarely involve a clear right or wrong answer because the Supreme Court is often split. Justices should be impartial, but this does not mean they do not bring views to the court. As reflected in the close decisions, 5 of the 9 Supreme Court justices usually wind up on the ""liberal"" side and 4 usually wind up on the ""conservative"" side. Their interpretations differ. The interpretation of the broad language in the Constitution reflects the values of the judges, as there isn't always a definitive right and wrong. The language ""cruel and unusual punishment"" is very broad and hurts your argument. There is no standard for ""cruel and unusual punishment"". There's no specific description of what makes up cruel or unusual punishment in our laws or in our Constitution. The decisions in Hudson v. McMillian (1992), Hope v. Pelzer (2002), Trop v. Dulles (1958), Ford v. Wainwright (1986), and Atkins v. Virginia (2002) were not based upon ""the law"" as you state. They were based on judge's interpretations of those laws. There is no law that defines what constitutes as ""cruel and unusual punishment"". That is left up to judge's opinions and values. Now this is not my argument for empathy yet. This is my argument to refute your assertion that all decisions should be based solely upon the law. That's idealist and it's also impossible. There is rarely a clear right and wrong side in a lawsuit that goes before the Supreme Court. There are varying interpretations to laws. There is unclear and broad language in our Constitution and laws. Too much empathy can distort decisions and doesn't belong in every case. But it is very important in many cases. Empathy just has to be used carefully in decisions. The fact that many decisions cannot be reached solely based on laws and are often based on interpretation brings other values into consideration. Justices' experiences and values will effect their interpretations and application of different laws. In advocating for empathy, I will use the argument that has consistently been used in this debate. A case before the Supreme Court this year involves a former student of Safford Middle School in Safford, Arizona. Her name is Savana Redding. In 2003, she was taken out of class by the vice principal. The vice principal had found prescription-strength ibuprofen on one of Savana's classmates earlier in the day. The classmate blamed Redding for them. Redding claimed she didn't know anything about the bills and hadn't seen them. She was ordered to strip to her underwear and bra in front of an administrative assistant and the school nurse. She was also ordered to pull her bra and panties away from her body. The search produced absolutely nothing. No other students suspected of involvement were ordered to this search. There is no black and white decision in this case. The Supreme Court is now reviewing the 9th Circuit Court's ruling that the search was unconstitutional. When reviewing the case, I certainly want the justices of the Supreme Court to empathize with Savana and think what it would be like to be stripped to her bra and underwear. However, I certainly want the justices of the Supreme Court to also empathize with the school and think about the security of a school. Justices influence each other. Having justices who empathize with both sides will influence other justices and improve the discourse. Again, there is no clear right and wrong in this case. The word ""unreasonable"" in the Fourth Amendment puts this decision up to personal interpretation. It's quite clear that one can't rule solely based on the law in this case. The word ""unreasonable"" asks for individual thought. It asks for careful consideration. I can go more in depth in the following rounds. But I just think the claim that empathy should play no role in judging is ridiculous. I find it very hard to imagine wanting a judge without empathy. I ask you not to confuse emotion with empathy as the Republicans have been doing. That is far too basic and frankly retards the debate. In closing, I'll make it clear. Empathy is not sympathy. Empathy is merely identifying with the thoughts, feelings, and state of another person, as you stated. Empathy is looking at the world through the shoes of another person. It is important when considering the person who was cruelly or unjustly punished. It is important when considering the person who was refused a fair trial. It is important when considering the rights of someone who has been oppressed for over 200 years. It is important when considering the person who was unjustly searched. Not only is it important to emphasize those, but it's important to emphasize with the defendants, as there should always be a balance. Much of the Constitution contains broad language. That language is not explicitly defined. When cases involving that language are brought to the Supreme Court, they do not always have a clear right and wrong answer. These decisions require the personal interpretation of each justice, the personal interpretation that has been shaped by their values and opinions. One of those values can certainly be and should be empathy with others. Empathy is not meant to decide the outcome of a case. Rather, empathy should complement and inform the judge's approach in a decision. Impartiality and empathy can coexist on the Supreme Court."	CON	302
S2e3d8393-Af5bbf9c5	Heroin should be legalized	My opponent has forfeit his turn and leaves me with more time to fortify my argument. As I stated in the previous rounds, Heroin is a relatively benign drug, with the most major side effects including constipation and nausea. My opponent brought up the very valid concern of Heroin abuse in pregnant women. While it is important to stress that there is no single chemical that is 100% safe for all women, opiates are not associated with any physical birth defects. The primary concern is that opiates are passed from the mother to the baby, causing the baby to become addicted and experience withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms themselves can be harmful to young children, but this problem can be easily avoided by switching to a methadone substitute during the pregnancy. http://www.thewomens.org.au... http://www.methadoneandpregnancy.com... Before Heroin and other opiates were criminalized, they were hardly even seen as a public health problem. Most people believed that opiate use was simply morally wrong, akin to dancing or sexuality at the time. Even still, it did not have the same stigma about it as alcohol did, and rightfully so. It was seen as a luxury good, a symbols of excess, not as a symbol of social deviancy. http://www.druglibrary.org... Legalizing Heroin would decrease the profit margins of terrorist groups, and allow for Afghanistan to have a legitimate economy that did not rely on illegal goods. If this is accomplished, terrorist groups will loose a massive source of revenue, one that simply cannot be recouped by focusing on other drugs. The entire Heroin market would fall out beneath them, and their artificial monopoly would crumble. http://libertyunbound.com...	PRO	303

S8c1650c4-A618f8dbf	All drugs should be legalised, change my mind.	"Hello again, You claim people can function just fine on drugs? Under the influence of them? People lose control under drugs. It has been proven in studies that drug use leads to depression, which causes higher vulnerability to suicide and self harm. Drugs also cause schizophrenia, and cause irrational behaviour in order to get drugs. People have wasted their entire savings purely to get another high. 1 in 3 adults have done drugs, that is correct; but the reason 1 in 3 adults are not dead or otherwise in a bad way is because they quit. ""Drugs"" are also a broad term, as I have stated. Of course, being poor and depressed is a problem. And of course, if they can""t find drugs, they""re going to find another form of escapism. But drugs are the elephant in the room and the most obvious path for them to take. If drugs are legalised, these people who hear about how drugs are the ""high of a lifetime"" or an ""escape from reality"" will turn to them, and become addicted. Few would intentionally go out and do drugs if they were legalised. However, few intentionally smoke or heavily drink despite it being legal to do so; yet they are peer pressured. Or, they are offered it at parties; since everyone around them is doing it, they figure, no harm done. As for the law being an obstacle, it certainly makes it harder to go get drugs. In order to obtain them you need connections, you need to know someone who can set you up. As for tobacco, you just need to walk to your local gas station. Drug dealers are people who exploit others for gain. While the main reason for cocaine being so popular may have been the high price of cannabis, it was also because cocaine is a stronger high than cannabis, and is more addictive. Thus, customers keep on coming back. Of people I have talked to that used to do drugs, they commonly dismissed cannabis as a ""beginner""s drug"". Some would seek to cure their addiction but the hardest step of overcoming addiction is admitting that it is indeed an addiction. Not every meth-addict will admit they have a problem, be it delusion as a cause of drug use or not. As for your question, yes, I would answer drug use is inherently detrimental.

Ultimately there will always be somebody who wants to break the law. What can be done though is to decrease both the incentive to do this by applying the criminal justice system and attempting to intercept and stop drug dealers and smugglers, confiscate their drugs and send them to jail. Legalizing and regulating sales of drugs will drastically increase drug use. They would soon become available in a wide range of shops. The display of drugs in shops will tempt ordinary people, especially vulnerable people to try these drugs. The thought of heroin and crystal meth on supermarket shelves is a scary thought. The amount of new drug users, particularly of the most dangerous ones would be alarming. Drug use would quickly become mainstream. The effects on people's health would be very damaging. The effects of illegal drugs are very dangerous. It would help eliminate drug cartels and criminals, but this would be outweighed by a massive increase in drug users, more people becoming drug addicts, increases in use of the most dangerous drugs and an increase in drug overdoses. These negative factors will see an increase in child drug use, an increase in absence from work due to work, increased unemployment due to addicts being unfit to work, increased drug related health problems including mental health and suicides. This will result in big increases in healthcare costs for dealing with drug related health problems. The effects of drug use will also see more crime being committed. This can be either through a person acting irrationally due to effects of drugs or in desperation to find money to fund drug purchases. Currently drug use is much lower than alcohol and tobacco use. This is because it is illegal. The fact it is illegal helps people understand that drugs are dangerous. Legalizing and regulating drug production and sales will result in many people believing that drugs aren't that dangerous, making people more likely to try them. The fact drugs are illegal also deters people from using them. The fear of a prison sentence and/or a fine is an effective deterrant to many people. Placing drugs on shop shelves will increase accessibility to them. Currently having to go underground and buy drugs through criminal drug dealers scares many ordinary people and deters them from buying them. People could just pick up a bit of heroin off a shelf to see what it's like and subsequently become addicted to it due to its highly addictive nature. Drugs are very dangerous. They have no positive effects. They cause severe side effects, physical health problems, mental health problems and ultimately death. They are illegal for good reason.	CON	307
Sa799c6ee-A7869e46d	All drugs should be legalized and regulated	Firstly I will defend the analogy used in the previous argument. The comparison I made was that both weeds and drugs will always exist. Giving up and allowing them to become uncontrolled and endemic though would be economically damaging to the parties involved. My opponent states that many lives are ruined each year by the war on drugs. In my view this is an inaccurate statement. It is drugs that are ruining these peoples lives not the battle against them. My views on the prohibition of both alcohol and tobacco are based on the negative effects these drugs have on people. Both cause significant health risks and decrease productivity in the work place. Alcohol causes increases in both crime and substance related deaths. The following link shows the economic costs each year incurred by the US government from the use of Tobacco, Alcohol and all other illicit drugs combined. http://www.google.co.uk... Tobacco costs the US government $295 Billion annual loses of which $138 Billion is from health care costs, Alcohol $224 Billion of which $25 Billion is from health care costs and Illicit drugs cost $193 Billion of which $11 billion is from health care costs. All of these figures are horrifically high and demonstrate the danger posed by theses substances. However these statistics show that my views on not legalizing and regulating drugs are correct. Despite being less dangerous then many currently illegal drugs the costs of both Tobacco and Alcohol each year are greater then all illegal drugs combined. The total for illicit drugs even counts the cost of the war on drugs. This shows that while expensive the war on drugs is value for money. If the hundreds of currently illegal drugs were legalized and regulated the small savings from policing the war on drugs would be offset by huge increases in health care costs, costs from crimes committed by people under the influence of drugs and a decrease in productivity in the workplace. If regulated and legalized the annual costs of drugs would increase. This would mean the government would need to introduce hefty taxes on the many newly legalized substances to pay for the large increases in government spending needed in order to fund the economic shortfall created by the significant increase in drug use. This would see a similar situation to tobacco and alcohol where users of the substances are heavily taxed to pay for the many issues the substance creates. It is clear that legalizing and regulating drugs is the wrong approach. Although tobacco and alcohol consumption is decreasing among 15-20 year olds in the US these substances are still by far the most commonly used substances. The reason for this is clear. It is because they are legalized and regulated. Use of all other types of harmful addictive substances is considerably lower in the Western world than these two legalized substances. Although education works to an extent in reducing the use of these two legal substances they will always remain the most commonly used substances unless either they are banned, reducing their use, or other substances are legalized and regulated resulting in increased use of the newly legalized substance/ substances. Despite education warning people about dangerous drugs the legalization of drugs will see increases in drug use, especially the most dangerous types of drugs. My opponents approach of setting up numerous stores selling individual drugs would be both socially irresponsible and economically disastrous. Any country that used this policy would see increased drug use, drug related deaths and health problems, increased government spending on drug related problems and economic damage caused by the destruction of town centres caused by drug selling shops. The decrease in workplace productivity and increases in crime would also be problematic. Imagine an 21 year old bored hanging around in the town centre. I think its more likely he/she would enter into one of the proposed drug shops and try a legal substance then look for a dealer in a dark alley as they would need to currently. Yes its true some people are happy to source drugs from drug dealers but the majority are deterred by it for both concerns about safety and concerns about arrest and persecution. The threat of persecution is a genuine deterrent for the majority of citizens. Most people including myself do not want to break the law and risk going to prison. It is not a nice place. Drug legalization and regulation would remove this deterrent and many people put off by the threat of persecution would take advantage of the opportunity to try a variety of dangerous substances. It is true a small minority of people are tempted by the lure of using something that is illegal but these people re certainly a small minority as shown by the large gap between users of alcohol and tobacco and users of illegal drugs. In my view adult humans do require protection from the government when it comes to preventing them from taking addictive substances that cause impaired function and major health risks. It is comparable to how adult humans need protection from crime such as burglary, rape, fraud and murder. If the government simply decriminalized these immoral activities and let everyone get on with life as they please then a minority of adults would commit these immoral acts. It is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens from threats whether that be another nation threatening war, a criminal threatening burglary, a bridge on a public highway that has become unsafe and at risk of collapse or from a dangerous substance that threatens to cause addiction, impairment and death. In my view it is immoral to allow people to purchase such dangerous products. There are many vulnerable people in society such as people with disabilities and mental health problems who have impaired function when making a decision such as taking drugs. Allowing somebody to walk into a heroin shop and buy heroin is both immoral and wrong. The legalization and regulation of drugs will normalize drug use as will the numerous proposed drug shops. Many vulnerable adults will be tempted into trying dangerous drugs. Currently a small minority of people are tempted by the world of crime and use drugs. The legalization and regulation of drugs may end the problem of drug smuggling and drug dealing but it will come at great cost to any country that opted to do so both economically and socially. It is no coincidence that no major economy has regulated and legalized drugs. It is clear it is the wrong thing to do.	CON	308

S1304ecba-A5cee594	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"== Negation Theory == I feel like first I need to (briefly) address Wylted's complaints about my ""plan flaw"" and ""decriminalization"" arguments. Wylted keeps saying that I only ran these arguments because I think I'm losing, but that's really not the case. Anyone who did Policy Debate knows that you negate your opponent's plan on as many levels as possible. That's all I was doing. Wytled *never responds* to my argument that these are *permissible* arguments under the resolution because decriminalization is *not* legalization (since decriminalization keeps *production* illegal and merely changes the penalties for *possession* to being civil -- rather than criminal). If these arguments are *permitted* under the resolution, then you as judges can vote on them. == Round Overview == There are four *independent* ways that I win this debate. 1) Vote Neg on Solvency as a Policymaker Judge. Wylted got to craft a plan, and he has to prove the plan *solves* the problem he outlined. If he were arguing this proposal before Congress and could not *prove* that the plan would solve, then Congress wouldn't pass it. You have to pretend that you are a member of Congress considering Wylted's proposal. Because child porn would still be illegal in 49 states, you should not risk taking the *political fallout* from legalizing child porn at the federal level, when it will still remain illegal for most people. Spend your time legislating on more important issues. 2) Vote Neg on the ""Misleading"" Disadvantage. Part of Wylted's ""plan"" is to put child porn on the FBI website. I ran a disadvantage to this in Round 3 explaining that many people (like Wylted himself) will not realize that just because something is legal at the federal level does not mean it is legal at the state level. Clicking the child porn links on the FBI website will get people thrown in jail (by state authorities). Wylted claims (in his last round) that a lot of people who get prosecuted for child porn simply clicked the wrong link. Although this is *completely untrue*, if it were true, Wylted's plan just exacerbates this problem because it's really misleading for child porn to be *illegal,* but for the federal government to place free child porn on the FBI website and announce to the nation, ""hey guys, this is legal now (as far as we're concerned)."" This plan flaw is a sufficient reason to vote Neg under *Wylted's own arguments* (because even more people will be misled). 3) Vote Con because Child Porn Should Remain Illegal, with the Exceptions I Outlined in Round 2. Under the ""studies debate,"" as long as I prove that there is a *correlation* between viewing child porn and molestation, I win that it should remain illegal because if we lock people up for child porn, we also happen to catch a lot of molesters whose crimes have gone undetected. I'll address the studies debate in a second, but remember that Wylted needs to prove *causation* (that watching child porn causes people to become less likely to molest) whereas I only need to prove *correlation* (that people who watch child porn are likely to also be molesters). 4) Vote Con on the Decriminalization Counterplan. In the alternative -- if for *some* reason you don't buy that child porn should remain completely illegal -- decriminalize it, don't legalize it. Wylted *never contests* that *production* should be illegal, so he automatically loses on that point, and thus decriminalization (which keeps production illegal) will always be a superior solution (compared to Wylted's plan). In addition, civil penalties are better than both criminal penalties and *no* penalties because it funnels pedophiles towards treatment, which empirically makes them less likely to molest (as I proved with a study). === The Line-By-Line Debate == 1) The ""study debate"" I've offered *three* studies here: the Butner study [76 percent of child porn viewers were also molesters], the anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) study [among the group with the most anti-social personalities, 84 percent of child porn viewers were also molesters, but even in the least anti-social group, 27 percent of child porn viewers were also molesters], and a third study I brought up in Round 4 [33 percent of child porn viewers were also molesters]. First, Wylted *drops* the third study entirely, meaning he concedes there is a high degree of correlation between child porn viewing and molestation. The Butner study is *not* the only study to find that the correlation is high, but rather is the only one to find it is *that* high. Yet, even 33% is pretty bad. If one in three child porn viewers is an undetected molester, it's worth locking them up to keep children safe. Second, Wylted continues to question the Butner study, but his criticism is misplaced. His main criticism in Round 4 is that 23 percent of participants were forced out of the study, yet in Round 3, he said they *voluntarily* withdrew (which is what the source actually says). You have to question how ""coercive"" the study is if 23 percent of participants were allowed to leave. In addition, look at my source for this from Round 2: it actually cited the Butner Study Redux (the second of the Butner studies), which was meant to shore up the methodology so it would withstand criticism (such as Wylted's). Wylted is wrong to say that no conclusions can be drawn from it. Third, Wylted says the ASPD study is unreliable because it has a wide-ranging estimate [between 27 percent and 84 percent of child porn viewers were also molesters]. But the study has this wide range because of the *nature* of the study: it was ranking *different groups* of child porn viewers, based on their scores on an anti-social behavior test. The most anti-social group was the most likely to be molesters, but even the least anti-social group had a very high chance of a being a molester. Wylted keeps saying that his statistics win out here, but he *never responds* to my refutations. Wylted had two statistics. First, his ""1989"" study merely notices that child molestations have gone down since 1989, and *asserts* (without any support) that this is due to wider availability of child porn. However, I showed that *all* violent crimes have been falling dramatically since 1989, so the reduction in molestations has more to do with overall crime trends. Second, Wylted says that only 2.1 percent of child porn viewers re-offend, but this is a *three year* recidivism rate (which captures only the period when they are on *supervised* release). If you look over their lifetimes, you""d expect about 50 percent of them to commit another sex crime (based on comparable lifetime recidivism rates for child molesters). So, Wylted fails to meet the high burden of proving *causation,* whereas I succeed in proving *correlation.* Furthermore, I provided *multiple* sources (psychiatrists, behavioral psychologists, and molesters themselves) that showed that *causation works in reverse*: pedophiles who watch child porn merely strengthen their urges. Wylted criticizes my sources as merely anecdotal, but he has the BOP and he doesn""t provide a *single* anecdotal source from a child molester or psychiatrist who says that masturbating to child porn *helped* them or their patients avoid molesting. In addition, Wylted drops my evidence from an expert in psychiatry who says that 93 percent of pedophiles are *nonexclusive,* so they can strengthen their attraction to adults and lessen their attraction to children by watching *normal* porn instead of child porn. Remember, neurons that fire together, wire together. If you masturbate to child porn regularly, you strengthen the connections in your brain between ""attraction"" and ""children."" This is *devastating* to Wylted""s argument because it means that child porn should remain illegal because discouraging nonexclusive pedophiles from watching child porn helps them to control their urges. 2) The myth of the lonely fat Cheeto eater I made a devastating critique last round of Wylted's viewpoint that having curiosity about midget porn is the same as having curiosity about child porn. Most people know that child porn is illegal, and most people are not attracted to pre-pubescent children. I doubt your average porn viewer would download a video entitled, ""Nine year olds having sex."" Because of my critique, Wylted changed this argument (in the last round) to being that the lonely fat guy accidentally clicks a link that contains child porn and gets prosecuted. I was *waiting* for Wylted to make this argument the entire debate, but he never did. If you look back to Round 2, I included a provision in my proposed law that required that the person act *knowingly,* and I defined ""knowingly"" to mean that the person *knew* that the image or video contained a minor. So under my proposal, people who accidentally click on links would not be prosecuted. [You can't penalize me for only pointing this out now, since Wylted never made the ""accidental click"" argument until the last round.] Furthermore, prosecutorial discretion answers all these arguments. I have had the chance to interact with a fair deal of prosecutors, and *most* prosecutors are good people who have excellent discretion. There are a few bad apples. But repealing an important law because of a few bad apples would be the same as abolishing the police force because of a few bad apples among the police. Furthermore, Wylted *never* provides examples of his nightmare scenarios. He never shows nudists being prosecuted for posting pictures of their kids on Facebook. He never shows someone getting arrested for accidentally clicking one link. Most people who are prosecuted have hundreds or even thousands of images and videos on their computers, and usually they contain *very young* children, not 16-year-olds. It""s ironic that Wylted accuses me of relying too much on anecdote, when his *whole case* is built on a few anecdotes of misguided prosecutions. For all these reasons, I believe that *production* of child porn (which is *very* abusive of children) should remain illegal, and that *possession* should also remain illegal, but at worst, should only be decriminalized."

S9cf510cd-A9ddbca74	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"Thanks to DK and Subutai! This has truly been an exemplar of the sort of high-quality discourse this tournament was designed to elicit. I will review all the main arguments in this debate and then I shall concluded with some reasons to cast a Con ballot today. REBUTTAL Rules: Pro asserts that he can rebut dropped arguments. However, that is a violation of the rules, which state that no new arguments or responses are permitted at this stage. To present a wholly new rebuttal is to make a rebuttal with new points--there is no valid distinction between them. Insofar as something is new, it is prohibited. Therefore, any such new points must be disregarded. Definitions: Again, the only definition in dispute is that of personhood. Pro accuses me of ""rudely disregarding"" his points.Merely, I pointed out that the fact that he used two definitions was confusing. How should we evaluate personhood under his argument--using the general or the legal definition? Pro never says. I also pointed out that Pro never contested the logic of my syllogism. For those two reasons, please prefer my single definition of personhood. C1: The Rape Exception Pro basically concedes that the UDHR has no legal force. Pro then argues that ""to ignore [the UDHR] is... a rights violation."" Yet, if the document is not legally binding, why is Pro's assertion true? The UDHR does not construct any legally enforceable rights, and so no rights are actually violated by ignoring it. Since much of Pro's arguments are predicated on the fact that the UDHR gives the fetus rights, when in fact the UDHR does not, Pro's argument has been very much weakened. Pro then makes the wild claim that rape makes no difference; yet, not once in this debate has he contested the violinist example except for his illicitnew point in R4. He claims that the violinist is not the baby, the rapist is. But, that is not what the example says. The rapist is the group of music lovers who hooked you up to the violinist (the baby). The example doesn't blame the violinist, but it does assert that because you were taken advantage of and violated against your will, you do have a right to disconnect. Pro's new points completely misconstrue the example. Sub-point A: Firslty, Pro states ""forcing someone to save a life is wrong."" Next, as I noted in my last speech, ""since the mother is the sole source of the fetus's nutrients, by denying the fetus those things, she permits it to die. This is 'not saving' insofar as it is someone not doing something that would keep someone else alive."" It is just like the potential organ donor refusing to donate organs. He is refusing to save someone. Therefore, using Pro's own words, we can negate the resolution here and now. Sub-point B: Pro argued earlier that the reason the person could not disconnect from the violinist was that the harm to the violinist would be greater. I pointed out that, using Pro's rationale, society could forcibly extract someone's organs in order to save a dialysis patient's life. Pro has DROPPED this point--he has failed to respond to this concern. Therefore, since that kind of ""Brave New World"" state is clearly undesirable, the person can disconnect from the violinist. This is sufficient to negate the resolution. Pro's only claims here revolve around bodily integrity, but as I just showed, in situation where the bodily integrity conflicts (mother vs. fetus), the mother should have priority because of the dangerous precedent the reverse could set. Therefore, Pro's point is a non-argument. Additionally, Pro has to prove personhood before he can extend integrity rights to the fetus. C2: The Mother's Life Let me point out that Pro's source says abortion would be ""unlikely to prolong"" the life of a mother in danger of death from pregnancy. Yet, the source does not say ""impossible."" Pro also says self-defense must be a ""last-resort"" and in the case of an ectopic pregnancy discovered late, it may well be the last recourse. There are cases, such as heart conditions and ectopic pregnancies (which I mentioned earlier and which were DROPPED by Pro), where the mother's life is in danger, but not the fetus's. Even if these cases are unlikely, they do occur. Therefore, there should be a self-defense exception for mothers in those situations. I pointed out that Pro never attacked the validity of the self-defense rationale, merely, he asserted that it would never be needed in abortions. Insofar as I have shown that self-defense is needed, and that it is a valid legal and moral reason to take action, I have negated the resolution. Pro then makes a totally new and illicit argument about how self-defense would lead to a slippery slope. This argument should be disregarded on face as a breach of the rules. It can also be rejected because Pro contradicts himself. He state in R3 that ""The fetus has all human rights, and may only be legally killed in self defense."" Now he is saying that self-defense is an insufficient reason. There is a clear contradiction here. Moreover, I have, throughout this debate, maintained self-defense to be a right.Yet Pro is making utilitarian arguments, not right-based arguments, against it. Unfortunately, the issue is not one of utility (rights are not a numbers game). C3: Abortion in General Sub-point A: Pro is misconstruing my argument. I said that a fingernail was human, not a human. For example, I can say ""that fingernail is human,"" but it would not make sense to say, ""that fingernail is a human."" It's the adjective vs. noun difference. Therefore, my point was that a fingernail could not be given rights simply because it was human. It has to be a human before it can be given rights. I am glad that Pro agrees that a fingernail should not have rights. Extrapolating from this, I asserted that a fetus was human, but not a human. Because it was not a human, it--like the fingernail--could not have rights. 1. Pro makes a new, and hence an illicit, argument in response to my mitochondria example. But, even if you accept his impermissible argument, it's still incorrect. He describes the mitochondria as simply an ""add on."" Is not a fetus that same thing? A mitochondria has separate and unique genetic material, it even has its own membrane like an individual cell. Yet, it is still not a fully-fledged cell; it is an ""add on."" Why do we consider it an add on? Because it is totally reliant on the mother cell and has never existed outside of it. Now, let's look at the fetus. It has its own genetic material, and its own unique outer layer. Why should we consider it an add on? Because it is totally reliant on the mother and has never existed outside of her. Insofar as these examples parallel each other, my argument still stands. To use Pro's own words, the mitochondria (like the fetus) is merely an ""add on"" not a fully fledged-cell. Therefore, a fetus is not a fully-fledged person. My example, as I have always presented it, clearly destroys the idea that a fetus is a person. 2. I think this point as become rather convoluted. I will try to bring some clarity to it. I claimed that a corpse was a human, but it is no longer a human. Pro then stated, ""even a corpse is human."" I was using ""human"" as a noun, and Pro was employing it in adjectival form. Yes, a corpse is human, but it is not a human; it was a human. Pro also stated, society ""cannot use your body parts without your permission after you die"" I responded by positing, ""if you concede that we cannot use a corpse's body parts then your argument about the right to life seems hollow."" My point was that if Pro says we should be minimizing harms when rights conflict (e.g. ""the fetus loses out most if ignored""), then we should be able to harvest a dead person's organs to save a living person. Yet, Pro's own remarks contradict his claim to want to minimize harms because he would grant the corpse sovereignty over its organs. In the corpse scenario, Pro would have us NOT minimize harms, unlike in the abortion example. Yet, he provides no reason why these case should be treated differently. My extrapolation is that Pro is making conflicting deontological and utilitarian arguments throughout his case that contradict one another. This is a reason to prefer Con in this debate. If you buy either of these points, you must also accept, going off of my R2 analysis, that a fetus is NOT a person. This utterly destroys Pro's case because it rests on the personhood rationale. Sub-point B: Pro misses the point. If abortion is illegal, there won't be safe facilities to abort even in the U.S. Cross-Application: I already have addressed the UDHR points. Pro then says the following: 1. The fetus has unique human DNA 2. The fetus is human 3. The fetus is a person You could use the same syllogism in this way: 1. The fingernail has unique human DNA 2. The fingernail is human 3. The fingernail is a person This should illustrate the ridiculousness of Pro's claim. It is not merely enough to show that a fetus is human (adjective), it must be shown to be a human (noun). Pro has failed to do that, as I argued in C3, SA, points 1 and 2. VOTING ISSUES The BOP for this round is this: ""Pro must show abortion to be wrong in ALL CASES except when both the mother's and fetus's lives are imperiled. If Pro cannot do that, or if I can show additional exceptions, then a Con vote is in order."" Pro never contested this analysis. Therefore, if I win even ONE argument listed blow (or made elswhere in the round), I have won the debate. 1. No Compulsion to Save 2. Self-Defense 3.

The impact here is this: that Pro must show abortion to be wrong in ALL CASES except when both the mother's and fetus's lives are imperiled. If Pro cannot do that, or if I can show additional exceptions, then a Con vote is in order. CON's CASE Contention 1: The Rape Exception Again, the UDHR has no formal legal force. To quote my source directly, ""it is not legally binding."" [1] Pro argures that rape is a distinction without differece, but this is clearly a faulty argument for sevral reasons. Let's refer back to Thompson's analogy of the violinist. When one is forcibily violated in such an extrme and traumatizing fashion, one should be able to unplug oneself from the violinst. There is no obligation to spend your life hooked up to someone else. This particular example is DROPPED by Pro and links directly to the rape exception. Pro also asserts that the mother's right to bodily integrity is second to the life of the fetus. But, by this logic, we could force people to be organ donors--we could preform nonconsensual surgeries on them, extract nonvital organs, and use them to save others. Your right to boidly integrity, to be free from that type of invasion, would be less valuable than the right of someone in need of a kdney to live. Clearly, there is something deeply disturbing and wrong about forcing someone to undergo such a procedure, yet it would be justified under the rationale Pro gave. Sub-point A: No compulsion to Save Pro appeals to the ""inhumanity"" of my argument, but if you look at the foregoing example of the forced surgery, you can see that Pro's world could be just as ""inhuman."" Pro tries to claim the the fetus does not need saving--however, since the mother is the sole source of the fetus's nutrients, by denying the fetus those things, she permits it to die. This is ""not saving"" insofar as it is someone not doing something that would keep someone else alive. The DROPPED analogy I provided was if the only way to keep me alive was to have Matt Bomor (or Kim Kardashian) kiss my fevered brow, you still could not go to LA or wherever they live, kidnap them and drag the across the country to kiss my forehead. It would be an unnaceptable violation of their rights, even though it would save my life. They have a right not to be compelled to save me, or, to use my earlier phrasing, they are free to not do something that would keep someone else alive. Since Pro utterly fails to attack the logic in the example, this point should be extended. Sub-point B: Mother's Bodily Integrity I argued that if you had the right to bodily integrity, by what rationale can we deny that you have the right to disconnect from the violinst? Con's response was that the harm to the violinist was greater. But again, by that rationale we could forcibly extract someone's organs in order to save a patient of dialysis. It would justify huge invasions in privacy akin to a wolrd like that constructed bu Huxley in a Brave New World. At what point do things simply go to far? Contention 2: Saving the Mother's Life Pro DROPS the self-defense arguments I present. His only argument is that if the mother's life is at risk, so too is the child's. Therefore, if I can show cases wherein only the mother's life is at risk, this contention becomes UNREBUTTED OFFENSE for me. I have two examples to cite here. The first one is a personal example. My friend has a heart condition that prevents her from doing a variety of physical activies and so on. Her doctors have told her that she could likely sustain a child up until birth, but that the act of labor would probably kill her. In the cases of people with serious heart conditions, babies pose a serious, imminent, and lethal threat. Therefore, mothers have the right to exercise self-defense and to abort the fetus. The second example I will cite are ectopic pregnancies. While usually fatal, a small portion of them prodcue viable fetuses. [2] If a doctor realizes that a pregnancy is ectopic, he faces this dilemma: the pregnancy will likely kill the mother, but there is a much smaller chance that nothing bad will happen. Clearly, the threat to the mother is imminent, real, and lethal--she should be able to exercise her right of self-defense. Since Pro's only argument here has been shown to be void, you can extend my argument. Contention 3: Abortion in general Pro asserts that I have widened the ground. In fact, I have always asserted that I only need to win ONE of my contentions or sub-points to win this debate, as per the DROPPED framework analysis. Sub-point A: The fetus is no a person The arguments I provided against Pro in previous speeches, and which I will be summarizing next round, speak to this point more fully. I will make just two quick points now though: A Fetus is not A human. A finger nail can be desribed as human, because it is ""of"" us. Yet, we would not give it the fully panoply of rights simply because of that. A thing must not merely be human, it must be A human for it to count. 1. Pro never addressed my example of the mitochondria. The mitochondria has its own, separate genetic material, but it is not considered its own cell. It requires the host cell to survive, it feeds off of, and gives back, to the host, but it is not an individual per se. Apply this DROPPED point to the fetus. It may have its own genetic info, but that does not make it an individual. It cannot survive separate from the mother. It is not an ""individual."" 2. Pro makes the argument that a corpse is not a human, but yet, it clearly isn't the same as you or I. It was a human, but it no longer is. And, if you concede that we cannot use a corpse's body parts then your argument about the right to life seems hollow. If your rationale flows through, then society should be able to use the dead's body parts ot help others live good, healthy lives. Pro's point is contradictory. Sub-point B: Public Health Risks Pro argues that unsafe abortions are outwieghed by the lives saved by prohibiting abortions. Yet, in countries where there are no safe locations to conduct abortions--primarily developing nations--unsafe abortions account for 55% of all abortions. [3] Women have the right to expect to be able to control their own bodies, and to be able to do so in a way that is safe and controlled. Cross-application: The UDHR Pro again hinges all of his points on the UDHR and on the Personhood rationale wit his concluding argument. The UDHR is not legally binding, and--even if fetuses were persons--they would not retain the right to life in all cases. Just as an assailant can be killed in self-defense, even though they are indisputably a person. Therefore, even if you buy Pro's premises, that does not mean he has won this debate. Concluding Note: Since no new arguments or responses are permitted following this speech, Pro may not address any arguments he dropped during this debate. Therefore, all dropped examples, claims, and so on form a body of clear offense unique to Con in this round.

S4bd57607-Aa105c3d0	Resolved: The United States federal government should legalize all drugs	Today I'll uphold 2 main contentions, And then refute what was said by my opponent in the next round. Contention 1 is Crime Criminals don’t have access to the legal system, And must make their own justice. For example, They can’t file lawsuits or involve the police. As a result, Hardened criminals punish others themselves, Typically through violent assault or homicide, Much like in Breaking Bad. In Drug War Crimes: The Consequences of Prohibition, Tenured Harvard professor and fellow at the Cato Institute, Jeffrey Miron, Who has studied drug criminalization and its effects for 15 years concluded that legalizing illicit drugs would decrease the homicide rate from 25-75%, Saving thousands of lives. Additionally, Illicit substances such as methamphetamine and cocaine are the primary composer of the black market and much of the criminal underworld (i. E. Drug cartels, Gangs, Etc. ). If such substances were to be legalized, It would essentially kill a great deal of organized crime in not only the US but abroad. If one wished to take a counterexample, Alcohol prohibition directly caused the rise of mobsters such as Al Capone, And upon its repeal, The market was eradicated Oft human trafficking victims are become addicted via their kidnappers’ coercion, And become reliant on some sort of drug that can only be supplied by their gangster or pimp. Again, Legalization would kill their monopoly on illegal drugs, And they could try to buy said drugs at CVS or Walgreens. Additionally, The War on Drugs has directly led to mass incarceration, Which has made millions sit behind bars oft never accomplishing anything to benefit overall society. Contention 2 is Freedom Is it the government's duty to punish what are arguably victimless crimes, Drug use/abuse harms no one but the user. It isn’t as if drug users were actively going out and about harming others, Rather they’re only harming themselves. If we were to apply this principle equally across the board, Criminalizing any action that is harmful, The government would have to ban everything from food to sky diving to sexual intercourse. Which right do you have to decide what is permissible to go inside someone else’s body? Certain things are harmful to one’s self, Of course, But why does this mean they have to be criminalized?

S1304ecba-A21a712ca	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"== Rebuttal == *Note: I'm going to switch to saying ""I"" since Mikal has not really been involved in this debate. Negation Theory Wylted complains multiple times in Round 4 that I am being cheap because I've argued a ""state versus federal"" plan flaw and for decriminalization. However, the resolution permits me to argue these things. If legalization of child porn by the U.S. federal government doesn't solve or there are better alternatives, then we shouldn't legalize federally. If the U.S. federal government shouldn't legalize, you vote Con. Wylted can't have it both ways. He says that he gets to draft the resolution, so he doesn't have to argue for legalization of child porn produced ""for profit"" because he said Round 1 that this wasn't included. So when his topic drafting *benefits* him, he wants the judges to give him the full benefits. But when he made a *major* mistake in topic drafting (by limiting it to federal and *not* limiting out decriminalization), he wants the judges *not* to penalize him. So he wants all of the benefits of good topic drafting but none of the punishment for *poor* topic drafting. That's unfair. He got to draft the topic: he's stuck with the one he drafted. It's additionally unfair because I've already spent *a lot* of character space advancing these two arguments. They shouldn't get thrown out when they are *permissible* arguments under the resolution. Voting Wylted down on either the plan flaw or decriminalization is good because it helps make him a better policymaker and gets him to consider more nuanced policy-making (e.g. recognizing the distinction between decriminalization and legalization). Furthermore, Wylted suggests that I argue for decriminalization because I think I'm losing the argument that we should maintain the status quo (with a few exceptions for selfies, etc). However, debate is a game, and the Negative side gets to test the Affirmative in multiple ways. I really don't think I'm losing that child porn should remain illegal. I just wanted to throw out a few more arguments to see how Wylted handled them. And he mishandled them by mostly complaining instead of simply responding. I know I have the easier side on this topic, but that doesn't mean Wylted can't also lose due to flawed policy-making. A) Production of child porn I'll allow Wylted to stipulate that producing child porn *for profit* should remain illegal under his regime. But merely by saying this, Wylted is conceding that under his regime, you *can* produce child porn as long as you don't intend to profit. And Wylted himself said in Round 2 that most people who produce child porn do *not* do it for profit. Wylted's plan therefore still allows children to be exploited by adults (in producing child porn). Wylted says it would still be illegal in his regime to have sex with a minor, which is true (due to statutory rape laws). However, Wylted is *wrong* when he says that you wouldn't be allowed to film two children having sex if child porn were ""legalized"" because in most states, if both minors are close in age, it's not statutory rape for them to have sex. Only child porn laws prevent you from filming two children having sex with each other. You could try to argue that this would be ""normal"" rape because consent wasn't fully voluntary since the children were encouraged to have sex, but similar problems are raised in the adult film industry (and that's not considered rape). Additionally, Wylted never contests that under his regime, people would be allowed to produce ""softcore"" child porn. All of my (unanswered) arguments about how *exploitative* the production of child porn is would still apply. We should keep child porn illegal to prevent children from being exploited by adults in the production of child porn. Wylted claims that because the FBI database would be available, no one would produce new child porn. However, the *adult* porn market is already saturated with free porn, yet tons of people still produce additional pornography. B) The battle of the ""studies"" My argument here is that the high correlation between child molestation and internet porn viewing means that it's a *good idea* to put people in prison for possessing child porn because we also happen to be getting a lot of molesters off the streets by doing so. This argument wins me the debate as long as I prove a *correlation* between child porn viewing and molestation. In contrast, Wylted has the much higher burden to prove *causation.* His argument is that watching child porn *causes* someone to become less likely to molest children. Not only is causation much harder to prove than correlation, but I am the only one in this debate offering actual testimony from pedophiles showing that causation works in the opposite direction: child porn merely *strengthened* their urges. In addition to the testimony in Round 2 from the Canadian pedophile and from John Carr (who works with pedophiles), the radio series ""This American Life"" did an episode about pedophiles who have never molested anyone, and these pedophiles say that getting ""clean"" (from viewing child porn) was a key step. [1] The radio series also interviewed a psychiatrist who said that most pedophiles are ""non-exclusive"" pedophiles (i.e. have *some* attraction to people their own age), and these pedophiles are capable of strengthening their more age-appropriate urges (e.g. by watching only age-appropriate pornography). [1] Ninety-three percent of pedophiles are ""nonexclusive,"" so it's very important that they strengthen their normal urges *rather than* strengthening their urge to f*ck children (by watching child porn). [2] Wylted also drops my defense of the Butner study and the other study I provided showing a high correlation between child porn viewing and molestation. Also, there's a third study that found that 33 percent of people convicted of possessing child porn were also molesters. [4] Wylted tries to defend his *own* study by saying that Japan and Denmark legalized *all* porn in 1989 and saw a decrease in total *rapes.* However, normal porn is different from child porn and rape is different from child molestation. Pedophilia is a disorder and it is *fueled* by images of child porn. Furthermore, this is not even true: rapes were *increasing* in Denmark during the 1990's. [3] And note that child porn is *illegal* in both countries. [6] C) State vs. federal plan flaw Wylted argues that federal legalization is good because it allows the states to experiment. However, legalization of child porn is an extremely unpopular position. It's never going to happen on the state level. Spending Congressional resources to get Wylted's proposal to pass is a complete waste. And it would be a hard-fought battle in Congress. Let's spend our political capital on better things. In response to my argument that people will be misled into thinking it's legal, Wylted said that's the point: that's what happens now. However, my argument was specific to placing child porn on the *FBI website,* which would mislead people to think it's legal (since the federal government seems to be endorsing it). I don't think anyone seriously believes that child porn is legal right now. Also, Wylted's portrayal of most child porn viewers as normal, fat, Cheeto-eaters is not correct. A very substantial portion of them are pedophiles. ""Normal"" people don't try to download videos entitled ""Nine-year-olds f*cking."" In addition, prosecutorial discretion usually means that only people with large collections of child porn are prosecuted, and these collectors are more likely to be dangerous pedophiles than normal, fat, Cheeto-eaters. D) Decriminalization Contrary to what Wylted says, decriminalization is not legalization. Decriminalization makes child porn ""unlawful,"" but attaches only a civil penalty (e.g. a fine or mandated treatment). The advantage is that the government doesn't have to look like it is endorsing child porn. Wylted never answers the argument that the stigma from child porn is good because it causes some pedophiles to seek treatment. ""This American Life"" also said that there is a very real debate within the pedophile community about whether having sex with children is immoral. [1] If the U.S. government started giving away child porn for free on the FBI website, it would strengthen the position of those within the pedophile community who say that sex with children is okay and ""normal."" ""See!"" they would say, ""the government is supporting our fetish!"" Wylted says that it's worth ""endorsing"" child porn if it keeps kids safe, but it doesn't keep kids safe if it helps pedophiles justify their urges to themselves as being normal and permissible to act upon. Wylted claims that the civil remedy of mandated treatment would be too expensive, but (1) it's cheaper than jail, so the government saves money compared to the status quo, and (2) treatment actually reduces child molestation among pedophiles, so it's a good intervention. [5] E) Free speech Note that Wylted is arguing that *producing* child porn is a form of protected expression. Merely ""viewing"" something is not ""expression"" within the meaning of the First Amendment. The government""s interest in protecting children from exploitation outweighs any claim of a First Amendment right to use children to produce porn. F) Wasted resources Wylted has to win the ""studies debate"" to win this argument. He has to show there is no correlation between child porn viewership and molestation to prove that the FBI wastes resources. Otherwise, if there is a correlation, locking up child porn viewers also happens to catch molesters. Furthermore, locking up child porn viewers is important because it reduces demand for child porn, which decreases supply [i.e. *production*] (which is very exploitative). [1] http://tinyurl.com...

S9cf510cd-A53f0b6ec	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"I will use this round to rebut DK's case--I will defend my own case next round. So, without further ado, I will present my refutations. PREMISES Overview: A. The resolution poses a question of what ""should"" happen--not what can happen. Please keep in mind that, regardless of whether or not you belive in the feasibility of legal abortion, that resolution is not concerning itself with such issues as viability of implementation. Arguably, Pro has yet to assert why it is not desirable to legalize abortion except to rely on the pershood rationale. B. Pro's Premises are design to show that persons have rights. These premises therefore rest on the validity of both of his arguments (insofar has Pro must show a fetus to be ""a living human.) If either one or both of Pro's arguments fall, his premises must also fall because they will lack any foundation on which to rest. 1. Roe v. Wade: Pro asserts that it is the opinion of the Court that if the fetus were to have ""personhood"" than abortion would be illegal. For the ake of argument, let us assume--momentarily--that the fetus is a person. Why does this mean that an abortion is impermissible? If you swing a machete at me, and I am forced to strike you down in self-defense, I have done nothing wrong. Yes, I have killed a person, but the threat posed to my life was justification enough for me to employ lethal action in response. Even the Supreme Court recgonizes the right of self-defense, including the right to use lethal force in defense of others. Being a person, therefore, does NOT mean that you cannot be justifiably killed . 2. UDHR: It is important to note here and now that the UDHR is NOT legally binding, and so it does not impose any postivie burden upon the U.S. to do anything. [1] A. DK has agreed that a woman has a right to bodily integrity, and if we were to take the UDHR on face, she would have that right regardless of a ""disinction of any kind,"" including, seemingly, pregnacy status. In other words, the fact that the woman has a right to control what occurs within her body, as well her own physical integirty, is not obviated by the fact that she is pregnant. If we grant that the fetus is a person for the time being, we should also grant the a fetus is wholly dependant on the mother for nutrients, etc. However, as per her right to bodily integirty, a woman has the right to control what goes on in her body. Therefore, she should be able to decide whether or not to continue to support the fetus inside her. If she does not want to continue to support the fetus, than she can abort it and deny it a home inside her. She has made a decision about her privacy and physical integrity. B. Just as the victim of a kidnapper can kill his captors to escape, just as a torture victim can kill his interrogators, and just as a homeowner can use lethal force against many intruders to protect their space, so too can the mother abort. There does not need to be any imminent threat to someone's life to exercise deadly force legally--in all of the foregoing examples, it is not clear that there is any imment danger of death, but the deprivation of the individuals' freedoms, physical integirty, and privacy was sufficient justifcation for the deadly actions. C. Finally, Pro discusses security of person and liberty as being rights. If a woman is forcibly impregnated, or is denied the liberty to control the goings-on and processes of her own body, are not those very rights being violated? Pro has not provided an answer for this. Even if we give the fetus those rights as well, why does the fetus's claim to those rights somehow outwiegh the mother's claim to those rights? D. I would also like to point out that the human rights status of abortion is hardly definitive or clear-cut. The Euopean Court on Human Rights, for instance, has established the ""right to a private life"" which permits women to pursue safe abortion where abortions are legal. [3] The Court has also consistantly failed to assert that abortions violate any entity's rights. ARGUMENTS 1. Is the Fetus Human First, I would like to make a brief point about semantics. When ""human"" is used as an adjective, it refers to things made by, of, or belonging to humans. Clearly, an embryo can be described a human because it is made by and of humans. Yet, ""human"" when used as a noun has a different denotation: any individual member of the species Homo Sapiens. [2] A. As a fetus is not fully formed, it is not a fully-fledged member of the species anymore than a President-elect is not a fully-fledged President. In both cases, the former is still developing the traits/abilities that will make it the latter, but it is not there yet. A fetus has potenital humanity, at the very most, but that is not the same as actual humanity. B. Consider also the notion of the ""individual."" Is a fetus an individual? It is not clear that a fetus is an individual for the simple reason that it cannot survive without the host, and has never existed separate from the host. Just as a mitchondria is not an individual cell, though it has its own genetic material, so too is the fetus not an individual person. Again, it has the potential for individuality, but that is not the same as having individuality in the present. C. Finally, a human implies that someone possess the full-range of capacities that make them alive. A corpse is not a human, it was a human. It lacks the full-range of physical traits that make someone a human. An adult has all of his or her organs presnet, has a skeletal structure and so on, making them a human. A zygote does not; it could be human, but until it develops those components that would allow it to survive outside the womb, it is not, in fact, a human. So, an embryo or zygote could become a human, but niether is a human, and this is an important distinction to make. 2. Is the Fetus Alive A. Many of these characterisitcs--like excretion and respiration--do not fully develop until later in the embryonic, zygotic, or fetal life. This brings up the question of WHEN does the fetus become fully ""living."" If it is only alive once all of these traits are realized, then it can, logically, be aborted before then, because it would not be a person. B. Moreover, let's look at the virus example for a moment. It is not considered alive because it fobs off reproductive and other functions onto other living cells--i.e., it is only capable of carrying out the functions of life vicariously. Because of this, it is not considered to be alive. A fetus is similar in that many of its life functions must be carried out vicariously throught the mother. In the same way that a virus is not alive, a fetus is not alive. I will discuss the question of whether a fetus is alive more in the next round, when I move into the defense of my own case. CONCLUSION It is now more in doubt than ever if the fetus is really alive, and whether it truly is a ""person."" If it is not a person, the case for abortion stands because Pro's premises rely on this one point. On the other hand, even if a fetus is a person, that does not mean that abortion should be illegal in all the cases that it would be in a Pro world. Therefore, Pro has much ground to traverse in order to effectively win this debate. First, he must demonstrate the personhood of the fetus, and then he must convince you that even in the exceptions I offer, abortion is never allowable. Thank you. I will be defending my case in my next speech, and I look forward to responding to DK's arguments. Thus, I urge you all to VOTE CON!

S9cf510cd-A797ae6c5	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"Thank you for the speedy reply. ---------------------------- Also, since Pro offers several definitions of ""Person,"" it may become confusing as to what it means, so I would like to present a competing, straightforward explanation of my own: I feel I should have explained better. I often used the definition you gave. The other uses were in reference to legal personhood. Although the two should be one in the same, and by law of the UNUDHR, they are. ---------------------------- Rebuttal I: The Rape Exception As I had prior said, the UNUDHR stated no distinction may void a human's right. Rape is simply a distinction without a difference. Rape held a painful impact on the Mother, but no Abortion will chance that. Nor does rape change the very genetics or humanity of the fetus. This isn't about saving someone's life, but upholding human rights. Life is a fundamental right, and must be upheld. Appling rape to the argument is quite literally only an Ad Populum that doesn't truly change anything. Nobody is less human because of the way in which they were conceived. Con has, by no means, provided evidence that suggests rape makes a fetus less than human. Con has only listed off a distinction without a difference, pulling on emotional strings, but nothing to show that the fetus is no longer human. Since the fetus is still human, rape does not void the UDHR's protection, and the fetus is still protected, without distinction. Rebuttal Ia: ""Why is that your sovereignty over your body is suddenly curtailed by the fact that someone else might die?"" I hope Con see's the inhumanity of that statement. Con is acting as thought the fetus will naturally die unless you save it. That is a grave misrepresentation of what is happening. The reason it's curtailed is because it is literally you calling the hit on the fetus's life. In this case, it's your choice that the fetus needs saving from. If someone is naturally dying, you are not ordered to save them... But when they are naturally living, and you are calling for them to die, the situation changes gravely. Con is acting like the fetus must be saved, but the fetus isn't dying, hoping the mother will save it. Con is wrongfully twisting the phrasing of the scenario in his favor. Rebuttal Ib: Con explains that the UDHR grants bodily integrity. However, it's not your body you are deciding over, but a completely unique human body. The child's DNA is completely unique, and thus its body is unique and separate. He is right that the UDHR grants bodily autonomy, what he forgets is that it's granted to all humans, even to the fetus. This is a case of two equal rights conflicting, and when two rights of equal status conflict, one must be void. The right voided must be the right that causes the least harm when voided. In one corner, the mother goes through labor, and may give the child away if she doesn't want it. In the other corner, the child will lose its life. In reality, it is one important right vs two important rights (one being gravely more fundamental) If a right must be voided, it must be the Mother's. The Mother's right to Bodily Integrity is not above both the Child's right to Bodily Integrity AND Right to Life. The mother may have full right over her body, but not the fetus'. So long as the UDHR stands, the fetus's is protected. A right stops where it steps on another more valuable than it, and the Right to Life is the more valuable of the two. Even if that is up for debate, the fetus is losing two rights, as opposed to the Mother's one. Rebuttal II: Saving the Mothers life There is no need to argue this. I'm surprised this got brought up. Con isn't arguing against the resolution here... If the mother's life is at risk, then logic says the fetus' life is also at risk. There is hardly such a thing as ""only"" the mother's life being at risk. If the pregnancy will kill the mother, it'll kill the fetus. Con's contention doesn't argue against the resolution. Rebuttal III: Abortion, in general, should be legal. Con has gravely broadened his ground here. Let's see if he can defend such a vast contention. Rebuttal IIIa: Being alive is not about whom you depend on or how much you depend on them. Surely even the Remora is alive. ...more so it is simply part of the mother's body because it users her body's functions. A terrible misconception. The fetus' DNA is entirely unique from the mothers. If you took a sample of DNA from a fetus, and tested it to see who it belonged to, the mother wouldn't be the one who showed up (technically, no one would, because the fetus is entirely unique from anyone). The Fetus has a body to itself, connected only through the placenta (1). The Fetus' body also performs a surprisingly large amount of its own functions (proportionate to how many it needs at that stage.) As my (rather unmentioned) Argument II shown, science is completely backing the claim that the fetus is alive. It must be understood that the law doesn't choose whose alive. That is a matter of biology, and biology says the fetus is fully alive, and DNA shows it has a unique body of its own. All of Con's arguments continue to be distinctions, which are void in the face of the UDHR. The only argument so far that wasn't a distinction was Contention III Sub-point A. The problem is that science is not on his side. Con used the argument that the fetus is dependent to attempt to dispute the whole of scientific research I have displayed, even though independence has never been a notable Characteristic of Life. I have visited many essays and pages to compile a list of these Characteristics of Life, and being independent isn't one of them. 1) http://tinyurl.com... Rebuttal IIIb: Breaking the law is risky in many ways... It's not really a playing factor in the issue of legality. How one chooses to break the law is not a determining factor in whether or not that law is right. But this is a common argument, so it's only right to discuss it. If made illegal, the rate of unsafe abortions wound rise, but not nearly enough to outbalance the scale. At the present, Abortions end slightly over 1,300,000 life's a year in the US(2). Unsafe Abortions, with a death rate of 0.002% (47,000 deaths (3) to 19,000,000 unsafe abortions (4) including third world nations) would have to rise drastically to outmatch the number of human deaths occurred while abortion is legal. It's nearly impossible to find the number of illegal abortions in the US, so I can't provide an exact number on how much Unsafe Abortions would have to increase, but if the ratio is at 0.05% in developed countries (by doing math (3)), than the number of unsafe abortions would have to increase by 1800 percent. The number would actually have to be higher, as the US's unsafe abortion ratio is much smaller than most developed nations, accounting for it not being on any UN, WHO, or Guttmacher reports because of the small number. Con must remember, as well, that illegal abortions are not always unsafe abortions. Con has to prove that the number of unsafe abortions would increase nearly enough to suggest more human life might be saved by keeping Abortion legal. 2) http://www.guttmacher.org... 3) http://whqlibdoc.who.int... 4) http://tinyurl.com... Argument I: Without Distinction Distinction, Noun: 1. The act of distinguishing; differentiation. 2. The condition or fact of being dissimilar or distinct; difference: 3. A distinguishing factor, attribute, or characteristic. (5) : a difference that you can see, hear, smell, feel, etc. : a noticeable difference between things or people : the separation of people or things into different groups. (6) Article II: Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.... Con must prove that the fetus is not human. Con has broadened his resolution to ""Abortion, in general, should be legal."" This resolution cannot be defended unless Con can void the protection of the UDHR. The only way to do this is through proving the fetus is not human. So long as the fetus is human, it's a person (as Con, himself, defined in R1) and therefore protected by Article VI, Article II, and Article III. Being conceived of rape is merely another distinction, one that affects very little of the fetus, if any. A man may not be held to the sins of his father. Abortion will not salvage a woman's happiness, legalizing it for her does her no good. Abortion has even been known to leave rape victims with a sense of guilt. The UDHR is very specific to say that no distinction, what so ever, voids these rights. Rape is implicit. 5) http://www.thefreedictionary.com... 6) http://www.merriam-webster.com... --------------------------- In this round, Con must rebute each of my arguments from R1. He himself has defined what a Person is... ""Therefore, persons are living humans."" A fetus is human... And biology and scientifically alive. A fetus is a person. My argument I and II have explained through harden science that a fetus is a living human. As Judge Blackmun stated, if a fetus is determined a person, Roe's case for abortion crumbles. “In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.” -Mr. Justice Blackmun [7] The premise of Roe's argument was on the premise of privacy. This was defended by claiming that abortion was a matter between a woman and her body. It's implicit that if a fetus is considered a person, that case falls apart because it is no longer a matter of her and her body anymore. As Mr. Blackmun implies, her Bodily Integrity ends where the fetus' begins. 7) http://tinyurl.com..."	PRO	325
S1304ecba-A3809867b	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"Thank you Mikal and Bluesteel for being willing to debate this incredibly important topic. I want to take this opportunity to address the voters before I launch into my arguments. I understand I'm arguing against the status quo, but I think the question voters need to ask themselves is; Will legalizing child porn save even 1 child from being sexually abused? If what I'm proposing saves just 1 child from losing their innocence, I'd say it's worth legalizing. When you factor in the life saving implications as well as the increased freedom and the savings in federal spending, you can see legalizing child porn is the lesser of 2 evils. JUSTICE A. A 2010 study carried out by Milton Diamond and his team at the University of Hawaii and published in the archives of sexual behavior show a sharp decline in child sex abuse since 1989 whn access to child pornography becam easier in Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA. This trend has also been seen in Denmark and Japan.[1] The fact is that easier access to child porn will and already has significantly lowered the sexual abuse of children. As much as child pornography sucks it exists. It always has existed in one form or another and it always will. We can't eliminate it, but what we can do is use it in a way that helps at risk offendors get their rocks off in the privacy of their own home as opposed to going out and seeking children to harm. Just to make this clear I'm not saying let's have a kid take one for the team so the rates of sexual abue go down. The F.B.I. already has the largest database of child porn on the planet. making this available to freely view for the public (discretion used to disguise the faces of known victims), would do a lot to curb actualy harm the underground child porn industry saving countless children. When you take in account that this being publicly viewable will help to solve some cold cases by pervs just by happenstance running into an image of somebody they know. The upside to making this database public could be incredible. B. Contrary to popular bellief viewing or posessing child porn doesn't make you anymore likely to rape a child than anybody else.[2]Yet the people actually viewing child porn often times recieve tougher sentences than those who actually abuse children. People caught posessing child porn on average recieve 7 years in prison. [3] Compare this 7 years with the average of 4 years that people who actually sexually abuse children get. [4] A full legalization of child porn like the one I advocate for would reverse this injustice. Under what I'm proposing if you rape a kid, you get a longer prison sentence than if you happen to come across some child porn on the internet but would not otherwise ever actually harm a child. My opponents might argue that watching child porn actually helps support the child porn industry and keep it alive. However this is completely untrue.[5] It appears that people don't create child porn for commercial purposes but instead to document their crimes. Plus with me advocating for the FBI to make their database available to the public it actually offsets the vast, vast minority of child porn that may be for commercial reasons if that even exists. C. As long as these child porn laws exist there will be law makers and courts expanding and interpreting these laws in whatever way they feel like to legislate there own morality and put innocent people in prison. Here is a list of things that you can do as a result of child porn laws that can land you in prison sometimes up to 20 years or more. "" A high-school boy over age 18 who engages in “sexting” photos of his naked, underage girlfriend to others via his cell phone (child pornography production and distribution) An 18 year-old high school senior who has consensual sex with his 14 year-old freshman girlfriend (this is sometimes defined as a rape, based on their age difference) A 22 year-old man who makes a home video of consensual sex with his 17 year-old girlfriend and downloads it to his computer, with his girlfriend’s knowledge and with no intent to share the video with others (child pornography production)[6] A 16 year old girl sexting photos to her boyfriend can recieve a really lengthy prison sentence. Under my plan these types of miscarriages of justice would never ever happen. As long as child pornography laws are on the books these are the types of things that will continue to happen. 'Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech."" A. This is also a freedom of speech issue. Congress isn't allowed to make any laws restricting the freedom of speech, neither is any other branch of the government. The judicial branch of the government has pretty much ruled that anything the general public views as obscene can be restricted.[7] The whole point of the first amendmant is to protect material thaat is viewed as obscene by the majority of the population. If the majority of people and the government agreed with the material to start with the first amendmant wouldn't even be neccesary. ""If the First Amendment means anything,"" Justice Thurgood Marshall said in the 1969 majority decision, ""it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.""[8] I just wish Thurgood Marshall would've added something about child porn at the end of that to make my case easier. If we're going to take freedom of speech serious we need to protect it in the instances where the material offends us the most. The things that offend us most should be the first things we stand up to defend. The battle for our freedom of speech starts and ends with child porn If we fight and win on this front than we win the freedom of speech battle on every front. Legalizing child porn saves a bunch of kids from being sexually abused but even if it didn't. Even if it saved zero and was null in that area than it would still be worth fighting for based on freedom of speech principals. Wasted Resources The FBI is experiencing some severe cuts on their budget which is actually getting in the way of a lot of their counterterrorism work as well as their pursuit of real criminals.[9] It's really hard to get ahold of exactly how the FBI spends their money but suffice it to say that they spent countless millions in pursuit of lonely fat dudes spanking their monkey to little girls. They spend countless millions pursuing people that are in fact causing no harm to annybody. All these people are doing is engaging in some voyuerism and some fantasy. They aren't at risk of raping anybody or engaging in sex with a kid. If the FBI could just redirect this countless millions away from lonely fat guys and redirect it towards counter terrorism or some other vital operation that actually saves lives. Conclusion Legalizing child porn not only saves children from being raped it actually could prevent another 9/11 when you consider the FBI focusing on more important counter terrorism measures. Legalizing child porn goes a long way towards protecting our freedom of speech and goes even further in preventing disproportionate prison sentences. There is no reason that some dude spanking his monkey to child porn should get a longer prison sentence than somebody raping a child. There is no reason to arrest some 17 year old kid for distributing child porn because he sent a penis picture to his girl friend. Vote for freedom of speech. Vote to reduce the victimization of children. Vote to counter terrorism. Vote for child porn. Vote pro. sources [1] http://www.springer.com... [2] http://www.theaustralian.com.au...

S8712369-Ac16009fd	Winter Regular tournament R1: Resolved, the USFG should legalize Euthanasia	"I thank my opponent for devoting his time to debate me here today, but like all good things it is time to close out the debate. Though not without addressing a few issues. My opponent seems misguided in this debate. He stated in his opening round, "" I will be arguing for voluntary, and non-voluntary Euthanasia, and in some specific cases, involuntary Euthanasia."" I spent my last round defining what these other two forms of euthanasia are. Now, my opponent expresses horror and disgust at what I'm speaking of in terms of involuntary euthanas, but I'm just simply arguing against what he had sad. This policy would legalize Involuntary euthanasia which my opponent even said was murder. As Pro he has to stand by his opening round statement and defend each of those three areas of euthanasia in order to fully win the debate and he has already expressed horror against one as he recognizes it as legalized murder, as so do I. To see here my opponent has to defend these key points and if he cannot then the debate ends with a Negative Ballot. Rebuttal 1: Resource Delegation My opponent just simply ignores the fact that my opponent's entire argument doesn't apply since it's PAS not Euthanasia. Oregon even prohibits Euthanasia as seen by the Department of Human Services (Oregon) even confirms this as I have shown last round. My opponent has DROPPED this thus nullifying this debate argument. [1] My opponent misquoted the original source. It was the International Euthanasia task force Source, not the Public health quote. Though I cannot bring up counter costs since this is the last round I can still bring up a key argument in this debate. Think of this. It's cheaper if you are homeless, no house bills, electrical bills and more. It's cheaper than living in a home. Why is this argument flawed? Though it's easier to live homeless most people would prefer to live in a home and bear the costs. The same can be said here. Not to mention that I have said that people in these situations are in the wrong state of mind and while it is more preferrable to live people ""think"" they want to die. Rebuttal 2: Quality over Quantity My opponent's argument here is misgided as it's based on PAS not Euthanasia. The very issue that he quoted was a PAS quote which leads to a major difference. Keep in mind that any arguments about PAS is untopical for my opponent. The difference is like PAS is giving someone a gun to kill themselves with and Euthanasia is when someone tells you to shoot them. MAJOR difference. What ""hypocracy"" my opponent is referencing is the Hypocrit Oath, but there's no time for that argument since it's the final round. Though when you see the situation I described it's completely understandable why most people are against it since killing someone is WAY different than handing someone the instrament to their death. Rebuttal 3: Euthanasia Regulation Again I'll say it again. My opponent misused the quote. The Oregon DOHS is not the source he's refurring to. I'll say it again PAS is not euthanasia. It's completely different and doesn't relate to this debate. My opponent hasn't given an American example of regulations that would occur. Plus with what he stated in his opening round how would the government use the ""sometimes"" Involuntary euthanasia? Who knows, but when you give the government a power and right they usually don't give it back. No, that's not what I'm talking about. Murder and Euthanasia, for the case of this debate, isn't the same thing. Rebuttal 4: Passive Euthanasia My opponent completely ignores the Palliative Argument. This is important as they help analyze the patient before death and before they choose what happens next. That is assuming they are in the correct state of mind and do not have dileria. This argument holds a great deal of weight in this debate as without it we cannot know if the individual is actually ready to make their selection and a great deal of the time they will select wrong due to their irrationality. Framework My opponent is completely ignoring the definitions I have provided on what these different kinds of euthanasia are and this is an issue since my opponent's ""sometimes"" is arguing for Government sanctioned murder. The definition my opponent provided was Voluntary Euthanasia. I addressed the other two elephants in the room. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia My opponent doesn't think my debate argument is topical, but it is. I will provide an example to show why it is. So this really is Topical unlike what my opponent believes. It would be like if someone defined Potato products and I talked about Yams, Tater Tots, and fries. It still falls under the unbrella even though it isn't the normal argument. My opponent is simply confused here as this isn't really the normal type of Euthanasia which is Voluntary Euthanasia, but these are things he advocates for and must defend. My opponent drops the impact here, so I'll extend it across the board. Contention 2: Slippery Slope Despite my opponent just yawning away my debate argument we can see that this isn't just that simple. Under this resolution and what my opponent is advocating for is murder. What else do you call euthanizing someone without their consent or because they don't want to? This is blatantly muder, but my opponent has accepted defending this type of euthanasia in Round 1. My opponent has dropped key arguments that show places that have actually legalized euthanasia and do all these things that Pro himself dictates as horrible. My opponent is mistaken on this interperation of ""Curing."" What my opponent is advocating for is pure murder as it kills the individual and ends their life. If you cure someone they're still alive. There's a huge difference here and my opponent is on the short end of the stick. Contention 3: Self Ownership and sickness I can agree with my opponent that we both hate pain and suffering and it is human nature to feel bad for those suffereing. There's a great deal of things I can disagree with him here and bring up arguments like a ""Burnout"" DA, but this is the final round. Though the issue here is that puts people into a temporary state of Irrationality. Not to mention the whole dileria argument that I had brought up from my last round. My opponent attempts to doge this argument by providing a Red Herring, but his argument must be disgarded as such. Conclusion Here at the end of the debate we can see the simple fact that there must be a ballot in negation. The reason for this is that at the beginning of the debate my opponent had stated that he would defend these three types of euthanasia: Voluntary, Non-Voluntary, and Involuntary. Throughout the debate my opponent has expressed disgusted at these types of euthanasia. We can see that in this debate my opponent drops the biggest impact of the debate and it is that of Government sanctioned murder. My opponent himself pratically also acceptted this type of argument to be true and that this shouldn't be allowed which flowed this debate argument into my favor. Since it is the only impact left in this debate there must be a Con ballot. He has also dropped several ethical arguments from Utilitarianism and Kant's Categorical Imperatives. Most of my opponent's were based around PAS which is NOT euthanasia and this untopical argument must be thrown out of the debate. Thank you and please Vote Con!

Premise I: Roe V Wade Conclusion In the conclusion of Roe V Wade, the court determined that if the personhood of a fetus is determined, the case for abortion falls apart. “In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.” -Mr. Justice Blackmun [45] If personhood can be determined, as is stated in the courts decision, the case for Abortion in Roe V Wade collapses. 5: http://tinyurl.com... Premise II: UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights The UDHR (Universal Declaration of Human Rights), signed and ratified by the United States, states the following… Article II Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty. Article II is saying that everyone is entitled the rights labeled in the declaration. Not one person, for any reason, may be refused these rights. The Article is very specific to include the phrase “without distinction of any kind… birth or other status.” If a fetus is determined to be a person, then the fetus may not be refused the rights granted under the UDHR. Article VI Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. According to Article VI, everyone is a person, as is their right to be one. This means all humans, so if a Fetus is human, it must be recognized as a person, and granted all rights, including the following.. Article III Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. If a fetus is a human, and thus a person (as stated by Article VI) then the fetus must be recognized as a Person by the law. This means that the fetus has the rights of all humans, including Right to Life. If the fetus is human, it's legally a person. Con must prove that the Fetus is not Human, because (as stated by Mr. Justice Blackmun) if the Fetus is a person (human), it is guaranteed the Right to Life. 6: http://tinyurl.com... (UN.org) Argument I: Is the Fetus Human? To be human requires only one thing. Human DNA. You do not need to look human, sound human, or think like a human in order to be human. All an organism needs to be human is the DNA of one (7). Of course we call it a Human Fetus, but is it human? The sperm and egg both carry 23 human chromosomes, and when they combine to form a Zygote, that Zygote has 46 human chromosomes (23 pairs)(8). Even though the Zygote is unicellular, the DNA is human. By extension, the Zygote is also human. Obviously we have human DNA, making us human, and we had that exact same DNA as a Zygote, so we were human even as Zygotes. Because the fetus is genetically human, it is a person, as determined by the above definition of Person. This mean the fetus must be recognized as a legal person, as stated by Article VI of the UNUDHR, stating everyone (all persons, which a human fetus must be by definition) has the right to legal personhood. The Declaration is very clear (in Article II) that ALL HUMANS are granted the rights (including personhood and life) without distinction “of any kind”… That includes status of birth, number of cells, level of development, or any other distinction… The Fetus' DNA is also completely unique from it's mother, meaning it is a seperate organism, and is not apart of the mother's body. 7: http://tinyurl.com... (Scientific American) 8: http://tinyurl.com... (Healthline) Argument II: Is a Fetus alive? While a fetus simply has to be human to qualify as a person, it's important to cover bases. The debate rages on regarding if a fetus is alive. The answer can be found in Biology. Biologists have as many as 10 characteristics of life. An organism doesn’t have to account for each characteristic right away. As long as, somewhere in its development, it possesses each characteristic, it’s a living organism. Much like how a baby can’t reproduce. It’s still alive because someday in its development, it can reproduce. For the sake of debate, we'll restrict the area of ""someday"" to before it's born. The fetus does, throughout its unborn stage, possess the following characteristics: 1- Homeostasis The placenta helps most in Homeostasis by providing the baby with oxygen-rich blood, while hormones and body functions are handled by the fetus’s body (9). The placenta is created by the fetus’s cells, meaning it’s a part of the fetus’s body. Even as a Zygote, the organism must maintain an internal environment. 2- Organization The cell of a Zygote has organized Organelles inside it. Since the early stages of being a Blastocyst, (usually 4-5 days of conception) the fetus is composed of 100+ cells (10). 3- Metabolism The fetus takes in a supply of nutrients through the umbilical cord, placenta, and amniotic sac (11). Where the fetus gets its nutrients is irrelevant. Everyone takes in an external supply, including humans. Few living things produce their own food internally. The fetus does produce a great deal of hormones on its own, including Insulin and Glucagon (12). 4- Growth The fetus starts growing from day one to the time it's born (13). 5- Response A fetus will react to its environment like any other human. A study by K.J. Shaw revealed that a baby will move in reaction to noise. This is sign that a baby shows response to its environment.(14) 6- Adaption Another study later found that, after a while, a fetus would start to remember the noise, and would stop reacting to it.(15) Another study also found that a fetus will adapt to stress (16). 7- Reproduction A baby is part of a species that can fully reproduce. A baby itself cannot reproduce much like a 3 year old child can't. It's not that it can't, it's that it's too young in its development to. 8- Excretion A baby does get rid of waste the normal way... While their waste is a little different than ours, it comes and goes the same way and for the same reason. Although a baby will usually hold in anything that isn't urine until birth, it can, and commonly does defecate inside the womb.(17) 9- Movement A baby is known for moving. Within a relatively short period, they are kicking and twisting inside the womb.(18) 10- Respiration A fetus breaths the fluid around it. The lungs do not process the fluids, but the breathing is important to a fetus. The actual respiration (intake of oxygen) comes from the blood through the umbilical cord. The process of respiration is clearly found in the fetus.(19) 9: http://tinyurl.com... (American Pregnancy) 10: http://tinyurl.com... (Euro Stem Cell) 11: http://tinyurl.com...

(Livestrong) Conclusion: Because the Fetus has human DNA, it is very much human. DNA is the determining factor in finding what species someone is. We can also conclude that the Fetus is alive. Using the definitions above, and the arguments, we conclude that... A) Everyone has Personhood and Right to Life. B) Everyone = Every person C) Person = A Human D) A Fetus is a Human E) A Fetus is a Person F) A Fetus is apart of Everyone G) A Fetus has Personhood and Right to Life Since a fetus is genetically a human, it's a person. That means that when the UDHR says that Everyone has each right, this includes a fetus. This is WITHOUT ANY DISTINCTION... That includes it's amount of developement or it's birth status or even if it's alive yet. No distinction of any kind. Claiming the fetus was concieved through rape is merely a distinction, and doesn't even begin to stop it from being a human. Any definition or case the Con may use to determine a fetus is different is pointless, as each difference is merely a distinction, and is completely irrelevant. Com must completely disprove that the fetus is Human. As Mr. Justice blackmun stated, if the Fetus is a person (and we can conclude it is because it's human) then it's protected by the 14th Admendment and abortion should be illegal. It should be stated that the Law must run off facts, not philosphy (in case Con tries to use a philosphical definition of Human.) Objective Biology determines if you're human, not Subjective Philosophy. A) A Person is protected by the 14th Amendment. A) A Human = A Person B) A Fetus = A Human C) A Fetus = A Person D) A Fetus is protected by 14th Amendment. I pass it on to Con."	PRO	330
S1304ecba-A7e77524a	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"Bluesteel is being cheap with some of his arguments and it's because he knows his other arguments fail. If his other arguments didn't fail he wouldn't be attempting to dodge debating this issue. He'd just forward his arguments instead of trying to weassel out of this. He doesn't reaally need to do this. He is already going to get a ton of votes from people not even reading this debate plus everybody from the G+ crowd. Him switching arguments like that is a concession that his arguments aren't strong enough to win. His arguments don't have to be strong or even better than mine to win. In fact he merely has to show up. I'm the underdog. No matter how strong my arguments are I still lose, and yet my opponent still feels the need to gain some unfair advantages. His arguments failed so hard that he now attempts to get on the same side of the fence as me and be pro child porn. When your arguments are so weak that you also start arguing pro child porn, you should lose. Him jumping from that side of the fence but barely touching on the other arguments, to appear as if he didn't abandon them is as good as a concession and if you're a voter it's okay to vote for me for those reasons, or if you consider his arguments unfair enough to warrant a conduct violation you can vote me the win for those reasons as well. HARD EVIDENCE VS CUTE STORIES I've provided hard evidence supporting my side throughout this debate. My opponent has provided a story about a child molester who is basically saying; ""Child porn made me do it"". Your isolated incident even if true doesn't trump hard evidence. The child molester clearly benefits if he can make people believe that he isn't responsible for his behaviors and that child porn is. The psychologist and his ad hoc arguments derived from personal experience doesn't trump hard evidence. Bluesteel has had to provide the ad hoc arguments and the isolated incident from a convict who gains to blame somebody or something else. He's had to do this because the evidence doesn't support his side. If the evidence was on his side he would just argue using the numbers and not some cute personal stories from a child molester or psychologist. The use of personal stories as opposed to hard evidence such as I've presented can be considered a partial concession as well. I just ask the voters to come to the same realization that Bluesteel already has. The realization that the evidence is in my favor. If Bluesteel knew the massive bias against me I have a feeling he wouldn't have thrown the incredible amount of hail Mary's he has, but he doesn't realize all he has to do is to show up to win. THE BUTNER STUDY My opponent's whole case depends on this study. The Butner study is crap. Not only were it's methods and questionnaires kept secret so nobody could review them but it wasn't representative of people who viewed child porn as a whole. Bluesteel never gave a full rebuttal like he said he would in the previous round so a lot of my criticisms of the Butner study still stand. 23% of the people weren't booted out but they ""asked to leave"", or were coerced or who knows what because the study wasn't scientific and wasn't made available for peer review. The people conducting the study even admit that the data was being used inappropriately and that the study was exploratory and the data not meant to be taken as fact. http://www.iprc.unc.edu... http://law.justia.com... This study is inconclusive while my studies showing a direct link between a reduction in child molestations and an increased access to child porn are connected. and nobody is asking for more of an increase in the access to child porn than I am. recidivism ""internet porn viewers had between a 27 percent and 84 percent chance of also being a molester."" Between 27% and 84% really? These numbers are clearly unreliable with that much variable where in contrast the meta study I showed stated that first time viewers of child porn with no prior convictions are highly unlikely to ever molest a child. (note) citation 6 in round 3 as sent to my opponent in the comments as requested, and citation for previous sentence. http://www.ussc.gov... The first time viewers with no criminal history really are just average dudes who got curious. Anybody can accidently click on a popup that sends them to a page with child porn on it and even if they got there intentionally. Just like watching midget porn doesn't mean you'll start raping midgets watching child porn doesn't mean you'll start raping children. Conclusion My opponent knows that the police unfairly prosecute people by abusing the child pornography laws and it's why he posted the amendments he did. The only way to make sure the laws aren't being used unfairly by prosecutors is to eliminate the laws. The only way to stop the unfair sentences with people viewing child porn receiving 20 year sentences while child molesters receive 3 years in prison is to legalize child porn. The only way to completely protect freedom of speech is making sure it applies to everything. The best way to prevent more molestations and to possibly solve some cold cases is to have the FBI release it's database. Let's save some lives. Let's legalize child porn"	PRO	331
S1304ecba-Ab1f3dd47	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	State Vs Federal I'm continually learning more about crafting the type of resolution needed to get the debate I want. I intended to advocate for a general legalization of child porn. Bluesteel knows that's the debate I wanted. Despite him having this overwhelming advantage of taking a position that more than 99% of the general public agrees with him on he still feels the need to Weasel out of debating the resolution by taking a semi pro child porn stance as well as attempting to win on some sort of technicality. Bluesteel, you're already almost certain to win by merely just putting up a strong showing. Why don't you stop trying to Weasel out of debating and take a stance? I'd ask the voters to consider how confident my opponent feels in his own arguments if he's trying to avoid debating this. Seriously you're con on child porn and receiving help from the highest rated debater on the site. What other advantage do you need, in order to feel even with me? Besides that the state vs federal argument is silly anyway. If the state legalizes child porn it would still be illegal on a federal level. Not to mention it's the FBI that handles going after all these child porn cases. Without them barely anybody would be prosecuted for the crime. Focusing on the federal government legalizing child Porn actually strengthens my case, because states can at least have the freedom and flexibility to work out any kinks with the newly legalized porn that fits each jurisdiction uniquely. My opponent also points out that an ordinary person could click on child porn for the novelty or out of curiosity and be subject to prosecution when he really doesn't even deserve it. This is my case folks. It's fat pervs that are eating Cheetos watching this child porn out of curiosity. It's not child molesters and my stats including the meta study I presented in the previous round prove this. As far as trying to paint people who watch child porn as child molesters it's absurd. Anybody who has watched midget porn, or gang bang videos (which in our society is almost everyone), can tell you that watching porn does't equal going out and doing what you see on those videos. I urge every voter who has watched a midget or other fetish porn and not banged a midget to consider their experience in judging this debate. I do have hard numbers for a lot of things, but what my case does that my opponent's does not is appeal to common sense. We all have fantasies that we'll never ever engage in, but my opponent expects you to believe people with those fantasies are different. There's a reason why every other porno we watch has a girl with a shaved vagina, and pig tails. There is a reason why the school girl and baby sitter theme is so prominent in many of the porns we watch. The reason is because we all have these fantasies even if subconsciously. Your not a bad person for it and neither are the people who watch child porn. They're just engaging in the fantasy and would never really hurt a child. My stats and your experience confirm this to be true. Active Endorsement Actually the government does hand out drugs. That's what Methadone clinics are. My stats show that less children would be harmed with easier access to child porn. Honestly who cares if it appears the government is endorsing child porn. I think their priority should be keeping children safe and the FBI making their extensive database available for public viewing would due to extra access keep kids safer as numerous studies have shown, but besides that it deincentivizes the production of child porn for profit. Any child pornography producers would go out of business, when the world's largest database of child porn is just a click away. Not to mention how many cold cases would get solved by people just happening to see somebody they recognize in one of the videos. If the FBI releases their database of child porn it will literally get offending pedophiles off the street and keep our kids safer. I think it's way better to make kids safer than to worry about the FBI receiving a little negative publicity. Decriminalize This is just sad. Bluesteel/Mikal are literally arguing the most popular position available to argue in any debate and instead of just debating against the position I propose they offer a plan that is almost identical. It would be like if I accepted a debate where somebody was pro gay marriage and I offered a counter plan that not only legalized gay marriage but also gave every gay man in America $20.00. Guy's, you're con child porn. The easiest position to take ever in a debate and despite that you're still trying to take the pro position. Why didn't you guys just instigate a pro child porn debate? Their plan is inferior anyway, because not everybody who views child porn is a pedophile. In fact it's the vast minority of people who view it that are. Also decriminalizing it does nothing to stop unfair government censorship and these treatment programs will be hella expensive while my plan actually saves the tax payers money. These attempts to escape debating, especially when considering how popular their position is as well as their skill level are such gross conduct violations that I urge the voters to award me the win strictly for conduct reasons. These ways to weasel out of actually debating this topic especially since it's 2 on 1 plus they are con child porn and could almost literally forfeit every round and still win (based on protest votes of my rape battle), are just odd and disturbing. Resolution Analysis I made my position very clear in round 1. In the comments I asked my opponents to review what I wrote before accepting to make sure we were both arguing a fair position. I knew the way I was using the term full legalization was a bit unusual, so I further elaborated on what I said in round 1. If my opponents didn't like it I was more than willing to compromise with them on the resolution. However they happily accepted the debate. Mikal/Bluesteel some of the debaters who do policy debates and are used to some of the silliness in formal debates at the academic level might respond well to you guys trying to weasel out of debating this by being shifty, but I think most voters are going to see this nonsense as several Hail Marie's put in place because your arguments were defeated. If you guys feel like your arguments are too weak to win, just concede. Don't attempt to weasel out of debating this by interpreting the resolution in a dishonest way or switching so you're oddly pro child porn as well but in a different way. Production of Child porn All these objections my opponent raises here are offset by the FBI releasing their ever expanding database. No producer of child porn can compete with the largest database of child porn on the planet. Justice My study wasn't debunked a direct correlation was shown between access to child porn and a reduction of children getting raped. Most countries in the study had strong child pornography laws but the countries who loosened their laws showed a sharp decline in child rape cases immediately following the legalization of child porn. The ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in Japan and Denmark in 1989 and a sharp decrease in sex crimes took place. This is beyond coincidence that immediately following the ban their was a Sharp decrease in rape cases. Every single study on pornography and sex crimes shows this exact same correlation. It's beyond coincidence. Freedom Contrary to my opponents beliefs the Supreme Court ruling on freedom of speech isn't final. The constitution of the United States is final regardless of whether activist judges intentionally misinterpret it to pursue their own agenda The pornography laws are very wishy washy and can quite honestly be interpreted however people feel like interpreting it. They are way to subjective and the proposals I make are the only ones that throw subjectivity completely out the window. Pornography laws have been and will continue to be used to suppress freedom of speech. Wasted Resources The FBI keeps it's budget secret or atleast hard to find. I don't know how much the spend on utilities or coffee machines or anything for that matter. The miners don't need quantifying if you can reasonably determine that the FBI spends a ton of money chasing people who view child porn. Common sense tells us that with the biggest database of child porn on the planet and being really the only government organization that makes it there business to go after random dudes who get curious about the wrong thing, they spend millions probably tens of millions hunting down people who view child porn. The makers of child pornography (aka the real bad guys) really are rarely prosecuted or discovered. This money could be better spent preventing the next major terrorist attack. Conclusion My opponent's are saving the full counter rebuttals to the stats next round, which is where I'll also address those things.	PRO	332

S1304ecba-Aea98089e	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	"(1) Children cannot consent I think we're all on the same page her but just in case let me repost what I posted in round 1. ""I'm not advocating for the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor. It would still be illegal to produce child porn for profit or sell it for profit. It would still be illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor. It would be illegal for an adult to coerce children into having sexual relations with each other."" As I've shown in round 2, Child porn is something created by offending pedophiles to document their crime. If there is a profit motive for this crime it would still remain illegal, however if you film yourself having sex with a child you would only get the charge child molestation. I think with the FBI releasing their extensive database of child porn it would kill any for profit motive that was out there. If it is out there. If you want harsher sentences for people who take advantage of kids sexually than make the penalties stiffer don't tack on this extra charge. I have defeneded my position on this. My position is that law makers with special interests in mind will use these production of child porn laws in an abusive way, so that 16 year old girls are getting arrested for distributing child porn when they sext. This might seem like a slippery slope fallacy but it isn't. This is history. Special interests have used child porn laws to send a message about sexting or to legislate their own morality. There would still be the same laws protecting children from sexual abuse. If an aunt, uncle or any other family member showed a video of themselves coercing a child into a sexual act or performing on or with a minor they will be put in prison with the video used as evidence. The problem with labeling something as pornographic is it's subjective nature. If a person posts a video on Youtube of their 2 year old taking a bath than they can be charged with producing child pornography. What I'm advocating takes a lot of the subjectiveness and throws it out the window. Under what I advocate for you and your kids can go join a nudist colony and take pictures of yourself and post them online without big brother coming in and throwing you and your spouse in jail for something completely innocent. My opponent's plan doesn't protect these innocent people from being abused by the law, by some judge who is trying to prove a point. Think about this. These pornography laws that prevent people from documenting the rape of a child could actually hurt conviction rates. Right now if I catch somebody in the act of murdering somebody I can videotape it and turn it in to police as evidence, but if I catch somebody raping a kid, I have to think twice on whether I want to hand over the child pornography I just produced. If I turn it in the perp would likely spend close to 4 years in prison according to the stats I provided last round, but me catching the guy and providing the evidence to convict him could get me a production of child porn charge which lands me more time in a prison than the actual bad guy. We can't depend on the common sense of prosecutors and law men in this either. They've proven that they can't be trusted to use common sense[7] and that's why even my opponent argues for a change in the status quo.<br><br> (2) Viewing child porn increases the likelihood that the person will molest a child ""As James Wolak explains in American Psychologist, pedophiles who view images of child pornography become more likely to molest children because viewing such images serves to *normalize* their fetishization of children and strengthens their urges."" This quote seems to have nothing to do with the article my opponent cited. The quote sounds like pure conjecture and seems to not go with the theme of the articele. While I don't doubt Wolak said those things I do believe it to be just pure conjecture based on no scientific evidence whatsoever. Here is a few quotes from the article summary to give readers a feel for what the article's publishers is saying it's about. ""The publicity about online ""predators"" who prey on naive children using trickery and violence is largely inaccurate. Internet sex crimes involving adults and juveniles more often fit a model of statutory rape."" ""This is a serious problem, but one that requires approaches different from those in current prevention messages emphasizing parental control and the dangers of divulging personal information""[1] If the article was specifically about the type of predators who are going to be largely discussed in this debate I'd purchase it for the $12 but it doesn't appear to be so. This is more than likely an offhand remark. ""The studies bear out these conclusions. A longitudinal study of convicted child molesters in the U.S. found that those who consumed more child porn were *more likely to reoffend* after their release."" This study looked at a very small subset of people. First it looked at child molestors not your average child porn watcher. second among child molestors it furthered narrowed it down to high risk child molestors (people already likely to reoffend) and lastly it looked at frequency of watching child porn.[2] This I think for the most part is just common sense. People who have a problem controlling their urges are more likely to obsess over child porn and watch it more. The obsessive porn watching would indicate a lack of willpower in these high risk offendors. It's the same lack of willpower that causes them to reoffend. This is a classic case of correlation and it's a more obvious case of correlation than my study on lower rates of child sexual abuse. I think the study I pulled up is highly suggestive of the ease of access to these types of images correlating to lower incidences of sexual abuse of a child. My opponent does bring up the infamous Butner study[3] as his main piece of evidence. According to Hernandez the individual involved in 2 of he studies my opponnt brought up; ""Some individuals have misused the results of Hernandez (2000) and Bourke and Hernan- dez (2009) to fuel the argument that the majority of child pornography offenders are in- deed contact sexual offenders and, therefore, dangerous predators. This simply is not supported by the scientific evidence. The incidence of contact sexual crimes among [child pornography] offenders, as we re- ported in our studies, is important and worthy of considerable empirical examination. However, it is not a conclusive finding that can be generalized to all child pornography offenders.""[4] This isn't the only problem with the Butner study. The Butner program is as stated by Judge Robert Pratt and the supreme court determined. ""the Butner Study is not credible. The Butner Study's sample population consisted of incarcerated individuals participating in a sexual offender treatment program at a federal correctional institution.....the program is ""highly coercive."" .....Unless offenders continue to admit to further sexual crimes, whether or not they actually committed those crimes, the offenders are discharged from the program. Id. Consequently, the subjects in this Study had an incentive to lie..........that the Study's ""whole approach"" is rejected by the treatment and scientific community. Id, Complicating this bias is the fact that the Butner Study did not report on the nearly 23% (46/201) of individuals in the treatment program who left due to ""voluntary withdrawal""......."" [5] The study refused to show it's methodologies or explain any of it's apparent deficiencies. The study is crap. On top of that the evidence besides me showing a reduction in sexual assault of minors all points to the fact that legalizing child porn reduces child molestation and is the lesser of 2 evils. A meta analysis was done of 21 studies and 4500 child porn watchers showed that there was only a 2.1% chance of them reoffending with a sexual contact charge.[6] Conclusion I skipped making rebuttals for my opponent's 3rd category because it uses the same Butner study for it's data. Some rebuttals were touched on by my opponents in the previous round and I will address those on my next turn. I wish my opponents good luck and look forward to their rebuttals. source [1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... [2] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] Andres E.

S1304ecba-A902250d7	The United States Federal Government should legalize child porn Wylted vs Bluesteel and Mikal	FRAMEWORK I'm advocating for the full legalization of child porn. My original intention was to take a softer form of legalization, but after diving a little deeper into the topic, I've decided to advocate for full legalization. I don't want anybody to be mislead by the word full. So please continue reading for conext. I'm not advocating for the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor. It would still be illegal to produce child porn for profit or sell it for profit. It would still be illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor. It would be illegal for an adult to coerce children into having sexual relations with each other. The reason I add the words for profit to what I'm advocating for is that I don't want to see a 16 year old kid take a penis picture and send it to his girlfriend and get thrown in prison for distrubuting child porn (which has happened on several occasions). One detail that I'd like o add to this is that the FBI has the largest database of child porn on the planet. I'd like to see the FBI make it's database of child porn available and easily accesible to the public, strictly on their website. VOTING GUIDELINES This is a highly anticipated debate and I want as many people as possible to give their feedback on it. I understand it reduces my chances of winning quite significantly, but I believe there are more important things than winning to consider. This isn't a topic much people give any thought to other than an initial feeling of disgust. I'm asking the moderation on the site to more aggresively moderate the votes than is typically taken. All debaters are putting a lot of effort into this debate and I'd appreciate if the voters will respect that enough to give incredibly thoughtful and thorough votes. This debate is open for anybody to judge even if your ELO is 1000. TEAMWORK I've been in contact with a few people who've shown interest in teaming up with me in this debate. I'm going to be going at this alone. To say I've recieved no help with this debate would be incorrect. I've had the privelage of debating this topic recently with a few people through PM as well as just bouncing some ideals off of one or two others. To say I've had no help in forming a cohesive argument would be a lie. Anybody who has given me help and would like to be acknowledged will be. A special thanks is in order for Mikal and Bluesteel to both agree to debating me on this important topic.	PRO	337

S9cf510cd-A3ac6cc9d	Abortion should be illegal in the United States except when both mother and child might die.	"Overview: The Person-hood contention is all I need. Judge Blackmun himself stated that abortion itself must not be legal if personhood is established. I've also turned his Bodily Autonomy argument into my own. Rebuttal I: Roe Vs. Wade: Con is making a false analogy. He dares to compare a fetus to a person swinging a machete. Homicide is only legal in self-defense (1) so unless the mother is without a doubt dying, which also implies both will die, Abortion must follow the same principle. Even then, a fetus is hardly comparable to a man swinging a machete. The words of Judge Blackmun that I posted wasn't just his sole opinion. It was the actual final decision of Roe v Wade. The court concluded that if personhood is established, the entire case for abortion drops because the fetus is then guaranteed the Right to Life. 1) http://tinyurl.com... Rebuttal II: Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Ratify: verb sign or give formal consent to (a treaty, contract, or agreement), making it officially valid.(2) Con fails to mention that his source is an Australian government site. While not legally binding there, it is in the US as the US both singed AND ratified the document. While Australlia doesn't consider it valid, the UDHR is a valid document in the US Government, with the US even releasing a report on how important the document is to the Government (3). A: Con is purposefully disregarding my words, cherry-picking what I said to fit his argument. I said the fetus also has Bodily Integrity. This isn't a matter of ""distinction"" as the voiding of the woman's right in this case has nothing to do with a distinction. To make abortion illegal disregards the woman's bodily autonomy, while to legalize it disregards the fetus's bodily autonomy AND his right to life, giving him priority in this discussion. This is not a matter distinction. If it were, con might have been on to something. And the woman's bodily autonomy ends where the fetus's body begins. She may do all things with her own body... but the fetus is not apart of her body (nor is it an intruder, as that area of the body was made specifically to hold it.) I've already explained this. Con has been disregarding my arguments as though I never made them in order to carry on his. B: Con is once again making a false analogy. An innocent fetus is hardly comparable to any of those scenarios. Even then, it does not void the fetus's rights. The fetus is more comparable to an annoying child that's costing you money and convenience, but surely you can't kill him. C: This is a matter of which right comes first. When two rights conflict, the more fundamental right must come first. The Right to Life is the most fundamental of each of those. These is another case where the fetus has a lot more to lose. In one corner, the women uses security of person, in the other corner, the fetus loses his security of person, liberty, and right to life. That's one thing Con keeps ignoring to make his case... Who has more to lose if their rights were put last for the other. D: Con must understand that this debate is about the US... Not the EU. Courts have let to conclude anything because Abortion has been seen favorably every year until the previous decade. Until recently, Abortion has held a very pro-choice majority. Since then, Abortion has seen many defeats in courts and congress. 2) http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... 3) http://tinyurl.com... Rebuttal III: Is A Fetus Human. Con is reverting to word play and semantics to win his argument. I have stuck completely to science. Being human is genetic, it is Human DNA that makes us Human (4). A: Many humans aren't fully formed after birth. Many are born without formed arms, or even fully formed bones. They are still human. This is, again, making irrelevant distinctions in an attempt to void the fetus's humanity. Being human isn't about how formed you are. The fetus has human DNA, it is human. B: An individual is defined as ""Of or relating to an individual, especially a single human:"" by the Free Dictionary (5). Since the fetus is a single human, it's an individual. C: Even a corpse is human (i.e. Human Corpse.) Ones humanity stays after death. This is why they cannot use your body parts without your permission after you die. For the sake of debate, I've fully explained how a fetus is alive. Con has started to depend on semantics and twisted word meanings to win his case. 4) http://tinyurl.com... 5) http://tinyurl.com... Rebuttal IV: Is The Fetus Alive. A: A fetus also can't reproduce... Much like a 3 year old child. Characteristic of life are not called upon immediately. They are more a guideline of what a living organism will develop over time. A child can't reproduce, and many people are born not able to feel pain or react, but they are all living. A fetus will, in time, develop each characteristic, making it alive. You don't become a living organism when you hit puberty and your body is fully developed to reproduce. You are already a live because when you fully develop you will acquire each characteristic. B: A fetus is not a virus. Not scientifically or logically. Nothing could reasonably turn a fetus into a virus either. Con is again using faulty analogies to dehumanize the fetus. I have already described, in full depth, how a fetus develops each Characteristic. The fetus is fully alive because it will develop each Characteristic before birth. Much like how a child is still human because he will develop the ability to reproduce, the fetus is a live because it will develop each of its characteristics. Although the unicellular Zygote cannot be held to the full requirements of a full grown organism. To be alive, a unicellular organism must have cell division. Scientists find out it a one celled thing is alive by putting it in the right medium, and seeing if it reproduces (cell division.) Although the long list some use is eating, maintaining an interior environment, and growing. All of which a Zygote does. It is illogical to assume the Fetus was alive as a Zygote then suddenly not a live until birth. Argument I: Parasitic Relationship? In case the argument is brought up. The concept of a Parasite is that it isn't supposed to be there. The woman's body was literally made to host it, and to create it. Because the woman's body was designed to host the fetus, the fetus cannot be considered a Parasite. it is a Mutual Relationship(6), and not a Parasitic Relationship. In fact, the mother actually gains a lot from the relationship. The definition of Parasite is too broad, and doesn't fully pinpoint or describe the complexity of a Mother-Baby relationship. One of the many benefits the Woman receives is Fetal Cell Microchimerism. What research has found is that cells from the Pregnancy is left behind, and helps prevent the woman from later issues like autoimmune disorders.(7,8) ""More recent studies suggest that fetal cells may actually protect women against autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis."" - Scientific American Like all things natural, there are a few messed up cases, but the natural relationship is beneficial, not parasitic. Also, the Woman's body gives the Baby nutrients. The Child doesn't just 'take' the nutrients and support, it is given it by the mother's body. The body ultimately has final say, which is why your heart beats without you making it. 6) http://tinyurl.com... 7) http://tinyurl.com... 8) http://tinyurl.com... Conlcusion: Con has reverted to extremely faulty analogies and wordplay to win his case. Both of which are known fallacies: False Analogy and Equivocation. Con's own definition of personhood has trapped him. A fetus is, without a doubt, human. It's in it's DNA. And even as a Zygote, it's alive. Much of Con's arguments exist by ignoring numerous of mine. Con even cherry-picked my R2 argument on Bodily Autonomy. Ignoring my entire argument and taking only the part where I agreed about the women's autonomy. He never discussed my argument, in fact. Con has dropped my argument about the Fetus' bodily integrity. The entire argument rest on if the fetus is alive, as its humanity is absolute. Of course, it's questionable still as seen in the definitions I gave in R1. This is also poor conduct on Con's behalf. I gave a definition of ""Person"" from two respected dictionaries, and then in Con's argument, he gave his own view of what being a person was, ignoring my prior set definitions and going with his own subjective view of it. Being alive was not a premise in either of the definition. Con simply ignored my dictionary definitions, and set his own personal definitions that included being alive, trying to wrongly change the requirements in his favor. Although I have still shown that a fetus is alive. This was poor conduct on Con's behalf. The definition of person was already set. Unless Con can show that the fetus is not a human, the fetus is legally, and by definition, a person. Killing may only be done in self-defense. If the women is at risk, so is the baby, thus upholding the resolution. Taking a human life is only legal in that scenario. This means that unless the women might die, abortion is not justifiable homicide. Also, anyone under 10 cannot legally break laws. Homicide: Verb The killing of one human being by another human being.(9) I have established that a fetus is scientifically living and genetically human. By both my definitions and Con's definition, the fetus is a person. The conclusion of Roe v Wade makes clear that if a fetus is defined as a person, the case falls apart, as the fetus is protected by the 14th Amendment and has the Right to Life. The UN also then protects the fetus, WITHOUT DISTINCTION. The fetus has all human rights, and may only be legally kiled in self defense. If the mother is at risk, so is the child. 9) http://tinyurl.com... Only if both mother and child is at risk does abortion become justified homicide. The Resolution is Upheld."	PRO	339
