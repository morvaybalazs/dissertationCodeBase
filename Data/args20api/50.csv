Sb7051d6f-Afe938d9e	The US ought to provide an universal basic income.	"For clarity I will be presenting my arguments on why we should not implement a UBI and then moving on to addressing my opponents point. With that out of the way I will move onto my arguments Contention 1: A universal basic income will not work. The New York Times(1) says that $1,000 a month to every American would cost around 3 trillion dollars a year. And $1,000 is a month is below the poverty line. 3 trillion dollars a year is almost the entire US budget and more than twice our discretionary funding. So we can see that A UBI is not feasible at all. Contention 2: A UBI would bring about a dystopian future. Imagine if you will a world where jobs are few and far between, those with jobs are locked in a competitive industry with few workers rights. The government is a tyrranical mess where the rights of the people are nothing.What I am saying is not some impossible nightmare, and as I will show you it is very possible. Subpoint A - Loss of jobs. Fox Business(2) says that because of increased automation, 22.7 million jobs will disappear by 2025. And CNBC(3) says that only with proper adaptability and commitment will the workforce ascend to the next level of work. Now what that means is that only with proper commitment by workers can we at least help to avoid rampant unemployment. And this is where UBIs comes in. According to the Foundation for Economic Education(4) giving handouts to every American would de-incentivize them to try and find a job. So as we can see a UBI will aid in a drastic rise in unemployment. In addition it will take away money and focus from useful systems such as a jobs guarantee which would solve the imminent unemployment at a much lower cost. According to The Atlantic(5) it would only cost 158 billion dollars a year, less than a 15th of the cost of a UBI program. So as we can see a UBI will exacerbate job loss and harm us greatly. Subpoint B - Loss of rights. According to Sapira(6) political rights are directly correlated with economic participation. She says ""And this is the real danger of a universal basic income it makes the citizens unnecessary to the government"" She also says that in societies where the state economy comes from sources that require only a small, fixed number of people to defend or maintain them, tend to develop autocratic regimes with little concern for the welfare of their citizens. To summarize, a universal basic income is a frivolous, expensive system that will cause a loss of our jobs and our political rights. Now I will respond to my opponents arguments. Entrepreneurship: In this argument my opponent presents that entrepreneurship will increase because people will have financial security. Now I have three responses to this. First, there seems to be a lot of different evidence tied together here. My opponent talks about the effects of entrepreneurship in India and Namibia, and talks about the danger of low economic security. But I would like to see the evidence that states that a UBI will fix this, and why. Secondly, There are more effective ways to do this. For instance a negative income tax, which I will talk more about later as my opponent mentions it, could remove financial insecurity. Which would in turn raise entrepreneurial spirit. Finally, this won't matter because we cannot pay for a UBI. Education/ College(I am combining my opponents second and third points because they deal with the same thing.): For these arguments my opponent presents that a UBI will decrease highschool dropouts and increase college and thus innovation. My responses to my opponents previous arguments apply here as well. I would like to see evidence specifically stating this and a negative income tax could do these things as well. And of course we just can't pay for it. Lower Work Hours: My opponent begins this argument by talking about benefits of lower work hours and then continues on to say that A UBI will lower work hours. But the crux here is that their evidence is about negative income tax not universal basic income. A negative income tax is very different from a universal basic income. Samuel Hammond and the Niskanen Center(7) published an article titled ""Universal Basic Income is just Negative Income tax with a Leaky Bucket."" And in this article they explain what negative income tax is ""The NIT, popularized by Milton Friedman, is an extension of the progressive tax system into negative territory. Just as someone making lots of money pays a higher tax rate, those below the poverty line would pay an increasingly negative tax rate""which is to say, the IRS would pay them."" Now this is obviously not universal, and is not an income. So really my opponent has no evidence that supports their claim that a UBI will reduce global warming. Economic Inequality: So here my opponent talks about how a UBI will reduce income inequality. But their evidence talks about raising people out of poverty. Now this is different because the rich will also get payed more, meaning the gap will stay the same. Systems that would go towards reducing income inequality do exists though. Systems like a jobs guarantee or negative income tax would do this, however these are not we are debating the merits of. So it's clear, A UBI will, cost too much, take away our jobs, take away our freedom, and it's benefits can be better accomplished with other systems. This means that it is flawed and unnecessary. For these reasons I strongly urge a con vote. Sources: 1 - NY Times - Porter, Eduardo. ""A Universal Basic Income Is a Poor Tool to Fight Poverty.""

Sd21a6c90-Afe1c27fb	Resolved: The United States ought to provide a universal basic income.	"I would like to thank my opponent for such an interesting topic. Good luck!!! The basis of my opponents proposal stems from the idea that what makes him/her happy is what should make us all happy, as if to say happiness is a ""one size fits all"" kinda thing. An idea that mediocrity should be good enough for everyone. I challenge my opponent to explain why someone whose idea of happiness is financial success or even endless wealth, is somehow immoral. What pedestal does my opponent get to stand on to claim that wealth is not a valid form of happiness, or ones pursuit of wealth somehow adversely affects everyone else? As long as those endeavors are done by legal means, then those pursuits do not affect others! It seems to me the United States has been trying to provide a universal basic income since the great depression, mostly by means of a minimum wage. Not to suggest that the minimum wage is the only factor that causes prices to rise, but it is the most effective factor to cause prices to rise. When the minimum wage goes up, then the cost of production goes up which then is past on to the consumer. I challenge my opponent to explain how causing prices to go up is an effective tool for helping those with lesser incomes. Furthermore, minimum wages can cause employers to have to forego hiring new employees. When the cost of production goes up, it causes business owners to go elsewhere for production. In the end, raising minimum wages only proves to make American workers less competitive on a global scale which causes jobs to disappear. I fail to see how stifling job growth is good for anybody. Many point to the industrial revolution as if it was a sad period for the American worker and point out the disproportionate nature of wealth distribution, yet they conveniently forget that it was an unprecedented achievement that took place. At no other point in written history has so many people been brought out of poverty so quickly. There were no minimum wages, so prices were low and so was the cost of living. Right now, China is on an industrious endeavor that could prove to dwarf the achievements of the industrial revolution. When production is left alone, it can prove to be very effective in bringing wealth to the masses. I noticed this is my opponents first debate on this site. I welcome you to the DDO community and good luck!!"	PRO	2
Sb7051d6f-Aad9c2571	The US ought to provide an universal basic income.	I'll deal with my opponent's arguments first and proceed to defending my own case. He says that a UBI is enormously expensive and as of now we can not afford such a program. Four responses to this. First, according to Matthew Ygleias of Vox in an exact rebuttal towards said New York Times article, UBI would put US spending to about where France and the Scandinavian social democracies are. Foreign nations easily do similar levels of welfare as the projected costs of a UBI. Additionally, the article my opponent cites is off on the projected cost by 600 billion dollars or so. Second, according to David Morris of Fortune, studies by the Roosevelt Institute indicate that a basic income would grow the economy by 12.5 % and shrink the federal deficit, meaning that a UBI would help the overall economy and goverment, not hurt it. Third, consider the cost of poverty on society, as children struggle through school as they work, as homeless people live on the streets, and many struggle to meet ends meet. Are they truly doing the best for our country impoverished. Millions who could be potential engineers, doctors, and scientists are currently wasting their potential, through no fault of their own, merely by the virtue of their social class. Forth, social programs in the status quo have spent billions of dollars with little to nil result. We could simply cut money from those programs in order to help fund a UBI. He says that people will become lazy and won't want to work. However, this is key to help mitigate the problems of climate change as proven by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, will nil adverse effects as countries throughout Western Europe have had similar levels of work for decades on end. Additionally, this isn't unique to UBI, as the status quo already does exactly that. He says that a job gurantee would solve the problem of unemployement, but I must ask; Where are these jobs? Where is the US going to magically sploof up several million jobs. How exactly is this a permanent solution, as at some point AI and automation will simply be better. It is incredibly unlikely that every single American will somehow find the time and money in order to better educated themselves in the new age of technology, meaning that we would likely have these problems regardless. He says that the dollar is key to political rights, however, it only takes one part in the overall goverment. There's democratic activities such as voting, running for office, protesting, civil disobidience and such which all allow nationals to take part in their goverment. I'll now deal with my opponents rebuttal. UBI gurantees that regardless of the circumstance, there will always be a net underneath you. If a business fails, the entrapener won't be sleeping on the streets. Same too applies for financial insecurity. If one wishes to quit their job, they have the ability to do so, as they have a source of income independent of their job. If my opponent needs to see the evidence where exactly this will occur, I simply suggest clicking on the article cited beforehand. If he needs further, may I suggest Scott Santeens' Medium article entitled Inequality and the Basic Income Guarantee. It goes both into entrepreneurship and education. On lower work hours, simply refer to what my opponent himself said in how he argued that a UBI would lower overall work hours. He's contradicting himself in saying there's no evidence to say UBI would lower work hours while only a few paragraphs above saying the exact opposite. Welfare programs lower the need to work, it's as simple as that. An UBI or NIT would bring forth the same basic effect, however, it would be greater under a UBI as it is provided to everyone, not simply those below the poverty line (or whatever thresehold one wishes to set it at). It wouldn't just be the poorest of the poor not working, many of the near and middle class would join in, guaranting that the intended effects would be brought forth. On inequality, I'll simply offer an anology. Envision a room full of 100 children (hopefully not locked up by ICE) where 1 has 101 candies and 99 have 1. If the 1 child had to give everyone else 1 candy, then everyone would have at 2 candies, and be a much more equal society. By the sheer virtue of the population size of the lower and middle class compared to the upper class, they will get a great deal more. Effectly, UBI is a great equallizer for a society, lowering overall inequallity. For these reasons I strongly urge voting for the motion.	PRO	3
Sb7051d6f-Ac7d7f25f	The US ought to provide an universal basic income.	"Ignore bsh1's stuff, standard rules apply for this debate. Please forgive heavy formating issues, as files are having troubles on my computer. This is written near verbatim from original sources which will be listed below. Contention 1 is Innovation As according to the US Department of Energy, clean energy innovation is the solution to climate change, being key to unlocking new technologies and low-cost clean energy breakthroughs needed to rapidly bend the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions. innovation drives the cost reduction necessary to transform global energy markets. However we don""t have the luxury of waiting for new technologies to emerge. We need to rapidly accelerate the pace of innovation to meet the challenge of limiting global temperature. UBI is linked to increased innovation in three ways. 1. Entrepreneurship According to Scott Santeens of the Medium, entrepreneurship is currently on a downward trend and businesses are also closing their doors faster than new businesses are opening them. This is because of risk aversion due to rising economic insecurity. When people are financially insecure, they worry more about going from paycheck to paycheck rather than innovation and startups. Incomes adjusted for inflation have not budged for decades, and the jobs providing those incomes have gone from secure careers to insecure jobs, part-time and contract work, and gig labor, decreasing economic security. Decreasing economic security means a population decreasingly likely to take risks. Because of UBI, the fear of impoverishment hunger and homelessness is eliminated. And with it, the risks of failure considered too steep to take a chance on something. Additionally, a basic income is also a basic capital, enabling people to create a new product or service. Such effects have been observed in Nambia and India where markets have flourished thanks to the tripling of entrepreneurs. 2. Education According to Dannielle Douglas Gabriel of the Washington Post, researchers at the Urban Institute found that nearly a third of the 563,000 teenage dropouts left school to work. On average, these teenagers earned almost a quarter of the money their families needed to live, keeping 42 percent of households from falling below the poverty line. UBI helps lower the overall dropout rate by ensuring teens"" families are guaranteed a basic income, building up a base for a future generation of innovators who otherwise wouldn""t have the skills go into STEM fields. 3. College UBI provides funds for higher education, increasing innovation as more students become college educated. Contention 2 is Lower Work Hours According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, western European countries have significantly reduced work hours while the US has not. Western Europe had about the same hours worked per person as the U.S. in the early 1970s, but by 2005 they were about 50 percent less. This choice between fewer work hours versus increased consumption has significant implications for the rate of climate change. Studies indicate shorter work hours are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions and therefore less overall global climate change via lowering levels of consumption, the impactof reducing work hours by an annual average of 0.5 percent in the US would eliminate about one-quarter to one-half of global warming. If work hours decline even slightly, climate change is averted as american consumerism falls. As Western Europe has had lower work hours than the US for decades on end, it proves that lower work hours don""t draw any significant negative consequences. According to Alicia Munnell, in the late 1960s and 1970s thee federal government sponsored four large-scale social experiments on the negative income tax a basic income program, the largest of whom including 4,800 families over an 11 year span. The experiments caused reductions in work effort, among women 17 percent and among men 7 percent. NIT basic income experiments have empirically decreased overall work. If done at a national scale, UBI would substantially decrease work hours and helping solve global warming through lower overall levels of consumption. Contention 3 is Economic Inequality Income inequality has been extensively correlated with environmental degradation, with] negative correlation between income inequality and environmental sustainability. higher the income inequality the worse the environmental indicators such as biodiversity loss and environmental composite indices [like ones ecological footprint. from an economic perspective income inequality reduces pro-environmental public spending via a ""relative income effect"" which causes shifts in the preferences of those with below average incomes in favour of greater consumption of private goods instead of public ones. Using data on 19 OECD countries studies found] that wider income inequalities were associated with lower environmental expenditure. According to Dylan Matthews of Box, researchers estimate that UBI would cut the poverty rate for all persons between 40 and 84 percent. Helping eliminating structural violence and poverty and making those formerly poor equals in society. Overall UBI first, increases innovation by increasing entrepreneurship, lowering dropout rates, and increasing higher education, second lowers working hours and by extension carbon emissions, and third, decreases overall inequality. all of whom link back to solving global warming.

Saf28e840-Acb8877ef	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	"The burden of the Pro is to show that some form of UHC is, on principle, should be guaranteed to the citizens of the United States. The Pro does not have to pick a specific type of UHC to support, nor does it need to offer a policy to implement it. Merely, the debate is about whether, on a moral/principle level, UHC should be granted. The Con should show that, on principle, UHC ought not be guaranteed. My argument: Essentially, we must be free from concerns over our survival in order to pursue those goals, desires we need in order to live fulfilling and happy lives. If we were starving or unsafe, those factors would unduly preoccupy our lives and threaten our independence. Thus, it is my Contention that universal healthcare is necessary to achieve true autonomy, because to be able to e self-actualize we must sate our basic needs. Sub-point A: Without universal healthcare, millions are endangered. According to Prof. Alan Derickson, ""the ranks of the uninsured swelled from 33 million in 1983, a year of severe recession, to 37 million in 1986, a year of buoyant recovery, underscoring""the degree to which this problem afflicted the employed as well as the unemployed"""" Currently, about 50 million go without healthcare. Derickson goes on to point out that millions of Americans are jeopardized by uninsurance. ""The real meaning of health insecurity is not the fears stirred by the lack of a reassuring plastic card in one""s wallet""lack of insurance means otherwise preventable death, disability, suffering, and loss. People without health insurance receive less care and, as a result, suffer higher rates of morbidity and mortality""about fifty Americans die every day from illness or injury because they have no insurance. Beneath the policy jargon and rhetoric""is a tragedy of human sacrifice."" According to Prof. Jennifer Prah, ""Lack of health care access increases risk exposure; failing to meet health needs when they occur can expose individuals to even greater risk of illness or injury later on. Illness itself brings vulnerabilities: a potential further decline in health."" Prof. Leonard Fleck, agrees, noting: ""The Institute of Medicine reports that about 20,000""uninsured Americans die each year for reasons directly connected to their lack of insurance""They die prematurely. How can a society as wealthy as our own that wishes to think of itself as ""just and caring"" tolerate that unnecessary loss of life?"" This enormous and wanton loss of life reinforces the concept that healthcare is necessary to simply survive, let alone be autonomous agents. As I stated earlier: to be able to pursue self-actualization we must have our basic needs met. Without universal healthcare, we cannot act autonomously, because needs go unmet. Sub-point B: Universal healthcare is necessary for physiological and security needs. According to Dr. Jeffrey Lobosky, ""The huge population of uninsured""Americans have been priced out of the American health care system"""" He observes that the uninsured pay most of these usurious expenses out of pocket, leading them into vast debt. This massive debt, notes Prof. Stephanie Woolhandler, is the cause of 50% of bankruptcies in the U.S. The sheer cost of healthcare presents a problem, considering that a family might have to choose between eating and paying a medical bill, preventing them from acquiring physiological needs. Additionally, community security is endangered by a lack of healthcare. According to Professors Chua Kao-Ping and Flavio Casoy, ""Communities with high rates of uninsurance have less effective control of communicable disease"" jeopardizing everyone""s health and that """"high rates of uninsurance and""uncompensated care costs weaken a community""s health infrastructure. Since healthcare is an important part of a community""s economic base, communities suffer economically."" According to Dr. Kenneth Thorpe, universal healthcare could actually save between 320 billion and 1.1 trillion dollars over ten years alone. Prof. Dale Murray argues that universal healthcare would grant, ""freedom from financial and care-giving burdens placed""by the uninsured, lower absenteeism, and more reliable productivity from a workforce that can access basic health services."" Thus, a community""s stability and security are risked without healthcare and, conversely, are helped by it. Sub-point C: Universal healthcare is necessary for belongingness needs and esteem needs. Prof. Norman Daniels notes that the sick tend to be ostracized from society and that universal healthcare would help remedy this. He posits: ""by keeping people close to normal functioning, healthcare preserves for people the ability to participate in the political, social, and economic life of their society. It sustains them as fully participating citizens""in all spheres of social life."" Thus universal healthcare promotes belongingness, as it does esteem. According to Kao-ping and Casoy: ""The suffering caused by uninsurance goes far beyond the purely physical suffering experienced by uninsured individuals. Emotionally, uninsurance contributes to anxiety, familial stress, depression, and fear. Financially, medical costs are a major cause of personal bankruptcy."" Anxiety, familial stress, and depression, all serve to undermine esteem, observes the American Psychiatric Association. Without our basic needs met, it cannot be said that we are fully autonomous beings. Without universal healthcare we""ll forever be dependent, ill, and unable to pursue our own dreams. Thus, to have true autonomy, I urge an affirmative ballot."	PRO	6

Saf28e840-A1f906ce	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	"For this Round I shall be defending my own case, in response to the Con""s rebuttal. The Con begins by claiming that I fail to warrant why UHC allows us greater freedom to engage in society. My Sub-point C, however, clearly explains the warrant for this. Furthermore, it stands to reason that healthy individuals, individuals who are not constantly afraid of becoming sick because they could not afford treatment, and individuals who are not forced by necessity into paying usurious private healthcare premiums will be more able to do the things they want to do, both physically, financially, and emotionally. I will now offer a point-by-point defense of my case. One: Uninsured (A) My opponent cites two statistics to lessen the impact of the number of uninsured. Firstly, I would point out that the $50,000 represents a household income that has to support all of the family members of that household. It is therefore possible that this income is stretched thin to provide for everyone. Additionally, that number says very little about where people are actually living""certain neighborhoods will cost more to live in than others. Consider that most Americans homes, according to the source she cites (Figure 3), make $75,000 or more. That""s a $25,000 spending difference, and indicates that the Con is not necessarily correct when she states ""do not have [UHC] because they don""t want and don""t need it.""In fact, it is very possible that many still can""t afford it, even at that income level. This seems even more plausible when you consider that, according to the Cato report she cites, the average cost of health insurance in the U.S. for a household is $12,106""24.2% of those families net income. Finally, even if we buy that 37% might be able to afford healthcare""which is a stretch""that still means that 63% are far less likely to be able to afford it. Then, the Con goes on to talk about how 40% of the uninsured are between 18-34. Yet, that means that 60% are not. Additionally, younger individuals tend to lack stable incomes, and, according to her source, tend to come from minority groups that historically and statistically have fewer resources. They may be ""healthier"" but they""re not impervious to illness""even the young need healthcare. (B) My opponent then claims that the U.S. has better care, and extrapolates from that that UHC delivers bad outcomes because it delivers poor care for ""most diseases.""Her own source states that this is a comparison of ""specific diseases."" In fact, she only mentions 4 diseases, which is hardly ""most."" Furthermore, her own Cato source states, ""although the U.S. health care system can provide the world""s highest quality of care, that quality is often uneven. The Institute of Medicine estimates that some 44,000""90,000 annual deaths are due to medical errors, while a study in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that only a little more than half of American hospital patients receive the clinical standard of care. Similarly, a RAND Corporation study found serious gaps in the quality of care received by American children."" She claims higher survival rates outweigh my evidence, yet her survival rates are for very specific ailments, and are not indicative of the system in general, nor do they take into account the problems her own source observes in the U.S. system. Finally, I have yet to see a warrant for the taxi cab argument. (C) Firstly, I discussed the notion of solvency in my earlier remarks. Secondly, according to the Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 30 million people will remain uninsured under Obamacare. Therefore, all of the harms of uninsurance remain in existence. Also, the ""comparatively cheap"" fine will increase over time until it becomes a rather large one. Furthermore, the Con cannot solve because of the 50 million currently uninsured, Obamacare will still leave 60% of them uninsured. (D) Her evidence for her ""20%"" assertion is a study conducted by LocumTenens.com. This firm, lobbied Congress through the GA Chamber of Commerce to reject Obamacare because of what it called, ""economically harmful"" practices that would be emplaced. It seems then that this ""20%"" study could have been more a tool to save it from having to pay out additional funds, rather than a legitimate study. Furthermore, the survey polled doctors who practiced mostly in the South. This tends to be a more conservative area, which would bias the study and make it inapplicable to the nation as a whole. (E) My opponent seems to agree that uninsurance is a problem. She claims, nevertheless, that UHC is not the answer because it create worse outcomes, and that I have no evidence to prove otherwise. However, both in my round one and round two statements, I have providence evidence about the benefits of UHC, in particular citing how it would actually benefit the economy, how it would reduce emotional suffering, enable more people to receive care, etc. I have also shown that the Con""s plan of Obamacare would leave huge numbers uninsured""that it is not ""universal."" I have also demonstrated, through Kao-ping and Casoy specifically, how uninsurance actually produces the ""worse outcomes."" Ultimately, it is by eliminating uninsurance that UHC solves the problem. Two: Security (A) The WHO evidence I provided in round two is clearly analysis ""on outcomes from countries with UHC to see if they""re any better."" Furthermore, just making things cheaper doesn""t solve the problem. If I can""t afford a drug at $100, but still can""t afford it when the price is reduced to $75, then I haven""t been helped. Everyone still needs insurance. (B) Obamacare does not solve, as I discussed earlier. Additionally, I provided more information on the impacts of the economics argument at the close of my round two statements. It also stands to reason that communicable disease will spread if people can""t get care because they lack insurance. My opponent never attacks this line of reasoning. She merely claims that, while that might be true, I offer no concrete impacts. However, even without those impacts, it also stands to reason that the spread of disease is something that we should attempt to reduce, regardless of the extent of the threat. So, you can accept the logical warrant for why UHC (by enabling more care through providing insurance) would reduce the spread of disease, which provides a reason for why UHC is good. (C) The Murray evidence is not reliant of testimony, and shows clear economic benefits to UHC. Additionally, here is some more information on Thorpes study, as researched and reported by the CBO: ""This study did not just focus on expanding access; it also assumed significant systemic changes including administrative simplification, computerized physician order entry, an automated patient safety/error reporting system, reduction in inappropriate clinical practice variation, and controls of provider payments and premiums to reach target goals in expenditure growth. According to Thorpe""s analysis""[universal healthcare] would save between $320.5 billion""and""$1.1 trillion."" (D) The NPR source only lists concrete economic problems in France and the UK""two countries cannot be used to condemn UHC as a whole, especially when the NPR source notes that Germany, by making several reforms, is doing better. In fact, the report never states that any of these systems lack viability. Rather, it seems to point out that with some tweaking, UHC could work fine. Three: Self-esteem All address all the points as one. All of this information illustrates and emphasizes the harms of uninsurance""the major problems with the Con. Taken in conjunction with other evidence I have provided, it does show why UHC is needed, from a moral perspective. It is what we ""ought"" to do. It""s not just the contagiously ill, but the disabled and chronically ill who are ostracized, and that""s something we should seek to minimize in a democracy. Universal care and universal insurance will combat this, and solve the problem.

This would seem to imply that, conversely, the Con must show that UHC fails to address these flaws, which the Con does not do. The Con merely talks about the viability of UHC""s implementation, but when discussing things ""on principle,"" feasibility""s importance is reduced. In other words, what we should do is more important than what we can do. But in addition to this, there are two other reasons to reject the notion that I must offer a means of repairing the current problems. Firstly, the terms ""on principle"" and ""ought"" negate the need for solvency. According to Merriam Webster, ""ought,"" in particular, connotes morality. Therefore, when discussing what we ought to do regarding UHC, we are really asking ""is it morally right for the U.S. to guarantee UHC to its citizenry."" Secondly, even if you don""t buy that solvency is unimportant, UHC does address the flaws of the status quo, primarily by eliminating uninsurance. By so doing, the myriad harms of uninsurance are alleviated, ""solved."" As Prof. Dale Murray notes, ""Major advantages from universal""coverage of the population accrue to virtually everyone. In regard to efficiency, these include more accessible preventive care, lower inappropriate use of emergency rooms""freedom from financial and care-giving burdens placed on others by the uninsured and lower absenteeism and more reliable productivity from a workforce that can access basic health services."" All of these are solutions to the problems of the status quo are discussed within my first statement. We both agree that we""re talking about UHC in general, not any particular system. Her final observation, regarding the phrase ""on principle,"" was to note that the term was as yet undefined. However, instead of defining the phrase, she offers an individual principle that the U.S. should uphold. But, just as it would be incorrect to define the term ""in general"" by naming a specific generality, is incorrect to define the term ""on principle"" by naming a specific principle. In fact, I would characterize ""on principle"" as meaning ""as a matter of morality in general."" But even if you don""t buy this, I still meet the burden as stated by the Con. One: Time (1) Rowley categorically fails to justify why UHC will be detrimental to the economy. He talks about the need to maintain hegemony and to avoid lower credit ratings, but does not draw any direct connection to UHC. In fact, the only two times he mentions UHC are to say that ""UHC will weaken the economy"" and that UHC would be hard to pass. Nowhere does he explain UHC""s direct impact on the economy. I would go so far as to say that all of the evidence offered by my opponent about the precarious nature of our economy fails to show why UHC would add to the problem. Specifically, the Con fails to warrant why UHC would lead to any downgrading in our rating""UHC will not necessarily add to the deficit. This is because there are many different types of UHC, and the program could be funded in a variety of ways, including compelling private insurers to foot some of the bill. But, since we""re not debating any particular form of UHC, it is unfair to say that UHC will invariably cause added debt or fiscal expenditure. (2) Even if you accept the validity of the Rowley evidence, it can be turned to show how the cost-benefit calculus bolsters the Pro. The Rowley evidence relies on a 1-in-3 chance that the U.S. would have its credit downgraded. That""s about 33% odds that UHC would damage the economy. Given the vast potential for improvement I cited earlier (greater longevity, better quality of life, reduced bankruptcy, etc.), these odds are worth it. So, when my opponent asserts that the U.S. should do what is best for its people, the cost-benefit-analysis here clearly favors the Pro argument; namely, because if we don""t implement UHC, the harms of the status quo will perpetuate, but if we do implement UHC, there is a massive potential (and a high""67%""likelihood) for reward. (3) I can agree that the U.S. economy is presently not ideal. However, UHC would actually be a boon to the U.S. economy, not a burden as the Con tries to (and unsuccessfully) argue. My Sub-point B offers important economic analysis to back my claim (Thorpe and Murray.) But additionally, I can show how failure to guarantee UHC is detrimental to the economy. Kao-ping and Casoy note, ""A lack of universal care leads to unnecessary use of the ER: [Use of the ER for common illness skyrockets when people are uninsured; namely, because the uninsured cannot afford to see a regular doctor.] The ER is an expensive place to receive care. An average visit to an emergency room costs $383.11 whereas the average physician""s office visit costs $60.12. It is estimated that 10.7% of ER visits in 2000 were for non-emergencies, costing the system billions of dollars. Additionally, ""Job lock"" ensues: Job lock refers to the idea that people stay with their jobs when they would rather work elsewhere because their current job offers health insurance. For example, many individuals opt to stay with their job instead of starting their own business""the number of people who would be self-employed if there were universal health care is close to 3.8 million. This loss of entrepreneurship is a real economic cost in a society that is relying on start-ups to offset the loss of jobs that are moving offshore."" This evidence supports the notion that UHC would not only be beneficial to the economy, but that a lack of UHC actually harms the economy. Therefore, in hard economic times, the policy of UHC makes sense. Two: Empirics (1) According to the World Health Organization, some 27 of the world""s best healthcare systems (taking into account waits, quality of care, accessibility of services, etc.) are nations with UHC. It seems, consequently, that the empirics actually support UHC. (2) Con only offers a handful of specific examples, which fails to give a broad picture about UHC in general. Canada, specifically, is having trouble with its system not because UHC, but because the Canadian legislature would take money from the program to spend elsewhere, leaving the system bankrupt. (3)The famous will still get special treatment, regardless. In the U.S. they can pay for more exclusive hospitals, doctors, etc. In fact, the kind of corruption/economic imbalance the Con cites would be more prevalent in a non-UHC system. Prof. David Stuckler, et al, note ""An over-reliance on partial""care appears to disproportionately benefit richer groups, reducing both efficacy and access to coverage."" The observe that this imbalance results from the rich being able to afford better care, whilst those with fewer resources get progressively inadequate and sub-standard care as you go down the income bracket. They go on to state, ""[A lack of UHC] also creates groups with strong vested interests in the status quo that can block further progress. Public financing is more equitable""and reflects the shared value of providing care based on need rather than ability to pay."" (4) Finally, even if there were a delay, it would still be better than receiving no care or sub-standard care, which is often the case when individuals are permitted to go without insurance. Furthermore, delays can be too long in the U.S. system too. As Kao-ping and Casoy conclude: ""(1) The uninsured are less likely to be able to fill prescriptions and more likely to pay much more of their money out-of-pocket for prescriptions. In a recent survey, one third of uninsured Americans reported that they were unable to fill a prescription drug in the last year because of the cost. (2) The uninsured are 3-4 times more likely than those with insurance to report problems getting needed medical care, even for serious conditions. In one study, more than half of the uninsured postponed needed medical care due to financial concerns, while over one third went without a physician-recommended medical test or treatment due to financial concerns. (3)The uninsured are less likely to have a regular source of health care. 40% of the uninsured do not have a regular place to go when they are sick or need medical advice, compared to less than 10% of the insured. As a result, 20% of the uninsured say their usual source of care is the emergency room. (4) The uninsured are less likely to get needed preventive care. When compared to the insured, uninsured, non-elderly adults are 50% less likely to receive preventive care such as pap smears, mammograms, etc. (5) The uninsured are more likely to be forced to delay medical services, affecting the timeline of diagnosis and thus the prognosis of the disease process""The uninsured patients were""1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed late for colorectal cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, respectively. (6) The uninsured are more likely to receive poor care for chronic diseases. Among nonelderly adult diabetics, a lack of insurance is associated with less glucose monitoring and fewer foot and eye exams, leading to an increased risk of hospitalization and disability""As a result of these myriad difficulties accessing health care, the non-partisan Institute of Medicine estimates that the uninsured have an excess annual mortality rate of 25%...which is of comparable magnitude to the number of people in this age group who die each year from diabetes, stroke, HIV, and homicide."""

S2d55d1c3-Ae2cc3545	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"My opponent claims I base my education argument on GDP spending per person, I do not base my education arguments on spending per person at all. With regards to healthcare, GDP spending per person is only a supporting argument, and not the base claim. My opponent also claims that wealthy nations will tend to spend more on healthcare. This does not explain why wealthy countries with universal healthcare spend less per person, than the one wealthy country without universal healthcare, the United States. My opponent moves on to say that people in the United States are on average much healthier in countries with socialized medicine. However, an investigation into health statistics prove this to be untrue. Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (which by the way, provides universal healthcare without socializing insurance), and New Zeland are among the top 10 in life expectancy. What is the ranking for the United States? 30th. (http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com...) Also, people in the US don't get preventative care as often, thus leading to diseases that are diagnosed late. These can be diseases like cancer, in which early diagnosis is essential. High quality services are fine, but they mean nothing to the people who don't have access to healthcare. It is better for everyone to have access to good healthcare than for some to have access to great healthcare, while others don't have access at all. My opponent makes the correct assertion that national health systems are not free, they are paid for by taxes. However, when the pubic spends taxes on something, that means everyone in society will get it. It is 100% coverage for all citizens in that nation. When paying for healthcare in the free market, insurance companies commonly drop people with pre-existing conditions, put caps on the amount of care you get, raise premiums (thus making it inaccessible for poor people who don't qualify for Medicaid), etc. The marketplace in the healthcare regard may be good for the producer, but it is certainly not good for the consumer. With regards to education, my opponent claims that growing household income makes private schools more affordable. Again, when a private school costs thousands of dollars a year, (See my arguments during Round 3 for a link) it won't help those at the very end of the spectrum. If a family can afford private school, they have the right to send, but for those that can't, public schools should be open to serve them, and for others that want their taxes to mean something. Public education may have problems in the United States, but it is doing remarkably well in other countries. Western Europe, Canada, Australia, etc. It is cost-effective there. And many countries even have free universities, while maintaining a strong economy with professional workers. You can have the best education quality, but that means nothing when some people can't access it. Like healthcare, better good for all than great for some/bad for others. The free market has a strong tendency to distribute wealth from bottom to top. My opponent argues that the likely reason I believe this is because I ""assume a zero sum game"". I have never implied that all gains by the rich are balanced by the losses of others. All I am asserting is that some (not all) people who control wealth do a lot in their power to keep it, distributing it among themselves. While gradually weaning people off of welfare might give incentives to work, to end the system completely and to allow people who are laid off in the future to go without assistance would be undesirable. Yes, charity groups will step in, but unless you have a universal public welfare system, some people will not have access to these services. I am not saying the welfare system can't be reformed. We can reform it entirely to get the people who defraud the system off. But to get rid of it would not be fair to those in need. My opponent says that oligopolies will always fall because of market forces. This is not the case. There will be, and there have been numerous cases of oligopolies that have stayed up for a long time, having power over the unregulated market. They are so powerful, as to successfully shut down any competition. That's why we need Government regulation to keep this from happening. I affirm that Governments will not always answer to the public. However, when the people are well-informed, the Governments are able to exercise power without abuse. John F. Kennedy once said that a well-informed people must work together with a progressive Government. And today, many Americans do not even know who the Vice President is. If the people are well-informed and keep the Government in check, it makes sense to delegate services to them. The 2 examples given by my opponent both used propaganda and misinformation in order to with election to the office. Socialization of food and housing for the poor does provide a disincentive to work. It shouldn't be brand name food, and it shouldn't be luxury shelter, but it should be enough to ensure that all men, women, and children have food to eat and a rood over their head in our society. You still have the incentive of working to get a more decent shelter and more food for your family, and the sense of security you get can aid you in the effort. Please note, I am not talking about people who can work but choose not to. I am talking about the people who want to work, but don't currently have the means of doing so. The ones who were just laid off. The parents who have to be at home with their kids, etc. Markets only provide services to those that can pay. In general, that is a good thing (You need to work to get a computer and TV), but for food, water, shelter, education, etc., you need everyone to have access. And people who can't pay will not have access. That's the evidenve that my opponent asked for in the previous round. Allow me to say that I have never meant to imply that business will pay workers pennies a day. But even as incomes rose, businesses still refused to pay their workers a living wage. Even today, the minimum wage isn't enough for young adults who are establishing themselves from life. Allow me to move away from wages for a bit, and talk about working conditions. The working conditions for people before labor laws were passed were horrible. Children were forced to work, cut off from educational opportunities. The factories and mines were crowded, the machinery dangerous. And the developed world still exploits the people who make products for them. The only difference now, is that low working conditions are prevalent outside our borders. The New Deal and Progressive Era may not have create jobs, but they did provide relief to Americans. Sometimes, what's good for the economy isn't always good for the public at large. While the welfare system we have today is full of fraud, to say that we need to end instead of just reform temporary assistance to the needy is undesirable. If the property rights system worked, how come people didn't sue companies for harming the environment? I did happen before, yet nobody when to court over property. It's because of the hassle involved. Very few people have the time/money to settle a court case, thus making a universal law more efficient and easy to handle. As I said before, as long as the citizens are well-informed, and keep watch on the Government, the Government can play an active role in society. My opponent claims otherwise, however, the social market model is working well from Germany, Scandinavia, etc. They are very rich places in the developed world, and Australia, New Zeland, Switzerland, and Canada all rank higher in terms of economic freedom, than the United States! All of these countries have excellent public education, universal healthcare, Government regulation of the economy, etc. Yet they retain economic freedom."	PRO	14
S2d55d1c3-Ae97ff3e6	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"As this debate ends, I would like to thank my opponent for providing an interesting and respectful debate. I will offer rebuttals and a closing statement. My opponent claims that nations with universal healthcare are not nearly as wealthy as the United States, and that the 2nd most richest nation on Earth (People's Republic of China) has only half the GDP of the US. For starters, this is incorrect. The PRC has an overall GDP of 12.61 trillion USD (https://www.cia.gov...), with the United States at 15.68 trillion USD. To offer a rebuttal to my opponent's claims that countries with universal healthcare are not as wealthy as the United States, this maybe true on an overall GDP scale (US is the first in GDP), this is not at all the case per capita, which, because of wealth production increasing with population, is the most reliable GDP measure of wealth. According to the International Monetary Fund (2012), the United States ranks 11th in GDP per capita, ranking behind Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and Canada. My opponent saying that progressive work policies increase life expectancy can be used as a support for regulations of the market. The United States, as it stands, has the highest healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP (17.9%), and has the lowest accessibility in the developed world. It is for this reason I believe healthcare fits into my first premise of Round 1. Regarding education, my opponent again uses overall GDP as a measure of civilian wealth. As explained above, this is already a false premise. Also, my opponent doesn't explain how Australia and Canada having only 1/5th of US GDP proves public education may not serve economies well. Even if private schools were competing to drive to costs, it may still be affordable to some families, and charity schools wouldn't be widespread (See previous rounds). If people are not receiving adequate amounts of food and healthcare, hoarding wealth would not be the ideal thing to do. This isn't to say that we need to get 50% of everyone's bank accounts, but a percentage of the wealth should be taxed and given to the needy. The problem with large-scale businesses is that many of them will use their wealth and influence to pressure Government officials, leading to crony Capitalism. This is why Government much regulate businesses to prevent this from happening. When it comes to public policy, the people should be thinking for themselves. And a decent education helps establish critical thinking skills. My opponent claims that public education has been used to indoctrinate children, and that is true. But in the United States, political beliefs are diverse, and given the freedom of information we have, to indoctrinate all children into a certain set of beliefs would be extremely difficult. The problem with Con's assertion that Communist nations have used public education for indoctrination, is that those nations did not have freedom of information, or freedom of speech. Therefore, parents could not criticize public school systems, and children could not get information for themselves. That is not the case in the developed world (although, given the public apathy of the United States, we need to be extra-wary in this day and age). What happens when the economy is stagnant (like the Great Depression)? People aren't going to be able to get jobs right away, therefore, temporary Government assistance is needed. While we should wean people off of welfare, we should not end it. My arguments on the markets only giving services to those who can pay doesn't come from emotion, rather, from the basics of how markets work. You pay, you get a service. You don't pay, no service. As I said in the previous round, this is fine for most services in the economy, but when people can't pay for food, education, or healthcare, it is a problem. A problem that can best be solved at the public level. The people selling products on the market usually only have one incentive: profit. Profit is not a bad thing, it is a great incentive; but it becomes a problem when people lose access to basic services to maximize profit. The birth of industrial Capitalism was the cause of low working standards, but there is no reason to assume that absent Government regulation, businesses would improve working conditions. If you have no incentive to change them (enormous amounts of wealth were being created, no incentive), and there are no laws, conditions will not change. Children were working to keep from starving. This is not ideal, for children should be at school, in proper growth conditions. The PRC has had an industrial economy for a while, yet working conditions are not improving. Large amounts of wealth are being created, but they remain at the top, due to lack of labor laws. Worker's unions are largely stamped out. While this may help people in the developed world buy cheap products, it is not fair to the workers in the world. Regulation and fair trade laws are needed to fix the problem. Progressvism didn't create wealth, but it spread it around, and provided better working conditions for the working class citizens. Initially slow wealth generation does not remove the implications of suing a large business in a court of law. In the end, you will have the same result, the business being forced to compensate the people and promise not to harm the environment. So passing one universal law would be more efficient compared to a property rights system. I will affirm Pro's point that Government run sewage systems pollute rivers. However, businesses would do the same, thus making the argument invalid. The Government should promote the nonpolluting chemical toilets, that would be a much better solution. The social market provides basic services to all citizens universally in a country, while continuing the marketplace to flourish, provided that they follow laws. Scandinavia provides all citizens with an equal footing, spreading the wealth created around. The argument my opponent used for Saudi Arabia can be debunked by the statement the preceded it, ""correlation is not causation"". There are many countries with universal healthcare and numerous social programs that rank higher than the United States on the economic freedom index. They remain more economically free. To say that regulations in general deny economic freedom would be debunked by the Heritage index. However, the types of regulations that the US does have are less than stellar, I will affirm by opponent's position on that. The argument my opponent uses in Round 3, that in some cases, trusts would be ""nothing to worry about"" is an incorrect analysis. The basic theories that both Con and I support (Competition drives down prices) would not apply with a monopoly. Antitrust legislation breaks up monopolies to protect competition. While it may reduce a company's incentive to become a monopoly, it still has them competing in the marketplace. Summary: My 3 basic premises from round one remain unchanged. Socialism, if done universally, is detrimental, however, if done on certain services, can expand access to all members of society. Capitalism can still work on most services in the economy. Regulations to protect the worker are needed to ensure that no exploitation is done. Quality public education, universal healthcare, low-cost/no-cost universities, and high standards of living are found all across the developed world, and given enough support, the United States can provide the same. Closing statement: I would again like to thank my opponent for this debate, especially for respectfulness. I would also like to thank Debate.org for allowing us a medium in which to debate. Although I support mixed economies, I can see where Con is coming from due to my former support of Free-Markets and Libertarian ideas. I wish all who read this well."	PRO	15
S3cd3a05e-A13c33ff7	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"This topic underlies many important issues in society. Thanks to Pro for instigating the challenge. Definitions Prosperity. Prosperity is measured by the average annual income of the members of a society. For societies that rely mainly by subsistence agriculture and barter, Calculations of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [1. http://en.wikipedia.org...], measured by monetary transactions, divided by population will not accurately reflect the relative wealth of the community. In any society, not all of GDP is reflected in individual income. I doubt that either issue will be important in the debate, but they might arise. For our purposes GDP per capita will be a suitable measure of prosperity. Distributions of wealth. Perfect equality would be everyone in society having exactly the same income. As a graph of numbers of people versus income distribution, in a perfectly equal society all the people would appear on the graph at a single spike at one income level. While there is only one way for everyone to be equal, there are many ways that wealth may be unequally distributed. If the factors leading to some quantity occur randomly multiply, the result will be a log-normal distribution. [2. http://en.wikipedia.org...] The distribution of the sizes of trees in a forest, IQ scores, the sex drive of humans, he sizes of cities, and a host of other natural phenomena are well described by the log normal distribution. So if a forest grows undisturbed, the trees will nave a log normal distribution of sizes. A farmer growing oranges will trim the trees to uniform size, artificially producing equality. I know this statistical talk is inherently very nasty, but I doubt there is any way to avoid it. Poverty level. We will need a definition of ""poverty level."" This is somewhat controversial of late, because the U.S. government has introduced a new definition of poverty in terms of equality. For this debate, I want to use the definition: The level of income in a society at which the basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter are met. The income level at which basic needs are met varies with the society. In the U.S., it is a family income of about $30,000 a year. $30,000 per year in underdeveloped countries would correspond to substantial wealth. It varies substantially within the US. In rural areas, $30,000 allows a better lifestyle than in expensive urban areas. I have no objection to using other definitions of poverty level in the debate, but I ask alternatives be distinguished by some additional word added to the phrase poverty level. Again I don't think we need an extremely precise definition. I will be arguing that the economic goal of society should be to raise as many people as possible above the poverty level, meaning that we should want as many people as possible to have their basic needs met. I think we can argue that without getting into a discussion as to whether for a particular society ""basic needs"" includes a cell phone or not. Happiness. I will need a definition of happiness. Fortunately, the idea of happiness is universal. There are actually measures of levels of happiness in societies. The important think is that the measures all depend upon self-assessment. The principle is that if you think you are happy or unhappy, there is no better authority for the opinion. The Wikipedia article on happiness economics gives an overview of the subject. [3. http://en.wikipedia.org...] The Satisfaction with Life Index is, I think, a pretty good measure. [4. http://en.wikipedia.org...]. United Nations Human Development Index is empirical, but it seems reasonable. [5. http://www.cnngo.com...] the two generally follow each other in broad outline. Pro's definitions Pro is right when he says that economic equality is about standard of living, but he's wrong in asserting that employers being fair has anything to do with that. People may be economically equal or unequal largely independent of employment. For example, The Prince of Monaco provides free housing to all citizens, and that has nothing to do with employer fairness. Subsistence agriculture has a high degree of equality with everyone self employed. ""Fairness"" is completely subjective. What Pro or the government thinks is fair may be completely at odds with other concepts of fairness. I have heard the argument that it is unfair to discriminate on grounds of competence. Pro also claims government must do all it can to fight unemployment. That's not a measure of equality. Again, rich princes may provide a large amount equalization without concern for employment. I agree that unemployment is a concern in economic policy, but that concern arises in my case and Pro's case. It's not part of the definition. A significant minimum wage always increases unemployment, but whether that is good or bad overall is a matter to be argued. If equality is the primary goal of economic policy, it can always be achieved through universal poverty. The question is about the priorities of policy. What's more important? On to Pro's case."

S2d55d1c3-A53c4a2dd	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"In his rebuttal of my first premise, Con claims that the only essential services in society are police, courts, and defense. While I agree that all 3 of those are essential services, I disagree with the notion that those are the only one that should be provided publicly. For example, healthcare is needed in every individuals life. Without the services, we could not live our lives (or at least, live them to the highest quality possible). And when healthcare can only be provided to those who can afford it (like the ongoing situation in the United States), poor people aren't able to live their lives properly. Thus, making the service essential to all members of society. The same applies to education. People need an education to have a basic understanding of the world. Before the common-school movement, very few people had access to it. Only the wealthy had that opportunity. So the Government started providing it, and soon everyone had access. Food/housing should only be provided to those who are in need. Not to those who have the means of acquiring them. I agree with Con that universal distribution of these services would not be good. The State would not ration this. Neither would they be the ""sole employer"". Transportation is a natural monopoly. One business could control the entire network of the city's roads/transit. So it would be ideal to place that power in an organization that answers to, and only to the public. The support for the second premise is affirmed. In his rebuttal to my third premise, my opponent claims that competition would cause businesses to not pay their workers pennies a day. Historical evidence shows that this is false. If all businesses pay their workers very low wages, the worker will not have much a ""choice"". In the late 1800's, this is especially prevalent. And if it is true that environmental laws are not needed, why did society start advocating for it? Because the notion that property rights could protect the environment didn't work, and doesn't work. Why go through the trouble of lawsuits and diverting capital to lawyers/courts when just outlawing it would be much easier and effective? If monopolies are unlikely in a free market, how come Theodore Roosevelt and many other Americans fought for anti-trust legislation during the Progressive era? Monopolies/Trusts were not taken down by market forces, instead, they were broken up by Government regulation."	PRO	17

And it's the fact they use the high revenue in taxes to have health care, other welfare programs, cleaner environment, and infrastructure that they are in that mess. ""Universal coverage does not mean universal care, as it will lead to rationing of care, either overt or via extended waits for care. Universal coverage would result in the government running the health care system making it worse than it is today - because the government can't do anything right. Competition is what made this country great, and universal coverage is anti-competitive as the government is involved. Even though every other industrialized country has some form of universal coverage, many are looking to add market mechanisms to their plans. This shows universal coverage doesn't work.Health care is not a right; if we are guaranteeing health care why not guarantee food, clothing, housing..."": http://www.joepaduda.com.... With the environment, it is not as bad as the Government says it is and the Government is overstepping boudaries. And infrastructure works better under a competitive environment. Implemented immediately. Expansion increases jobs. There is no other way. Point 5: The Constitution also says that Government overstepping its bounds (tyranny) is unconstitutional. Providing a bill like that is overstepping Governmental bounds. Government Social Security is an unconstitutional way of providing welfare. Point 6: If the lower and middle classes don't WANT to save, why force them? If they are dumb enough with finances, why make sure that the Government provides it to them free of charge and at a cost to the Government? The whole thing is unconstitutional because it makes the Government to big (read the Constitution) and just raises the Government debt. Point 7: Again, why make the poor pay it? This is just a ""just-in-case"" tax in case they run a deficit and need to balance. If the Government spends too much, they should face the consequences. Point 8: Why do it through the property tax? Why not some other tax? Why charge agriculture for education? Surely there must be better taxes for this. And if this is all you are proposing is necessary for the tax… Point 9: Again, most excise taxes are on addictive substances. They cannot stop taking the substance because they are addicted to it. It does not lower use because nothing can lower use except internally. Point 10: The competitive increase from the corporate tax decrease would be a great thing because that would increase quality and reduce price, thus helping the economy. And again, given free money, businesses will expand. That is the good thing about greed. It never ends. They will always want more. And with more comes more jobs. Businesses handed profits would not in their right mind not grow because they are essentially losing money. They will expand when given the opportunity. Point 11: Renewable energy sources are good when they are one, used in the right places (they cannot be used everywhere), and two, be managed properly and be kept out of by the Government (which means no carbon or gasoline tax, but also includes Government interference in the Renewable energy business). But you can also reduce dependence on foreign oil by drilling at home. Right now, renewable energy sources are just too expensive. If we drill at home, gas prices will plummet, and we will live in a stabler economy. We should wait to use renewable energy until it become practical to do so. Completely jumping in would be totally wasteful (but a little bit is good). Point 12: We need to cut all that is unnecessary to save the Country from disaster. That will mean making some hard sacrifices including the complete repeal of welfare. VOTERS: The Computer cut out half of my argument and I do not feel like re-making it. Please vote for my opponent. CONTRA: Thank you for accepting the debate and debating through. Thanks for a through and intelligent debate.

Saf28e840-A597a6720	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	"I’ll go over major issues in the round, pointing out why I’ve won them. -Solvency- Pro argues that morality doesn’t necessitate consequences, however he doesn’t offer any other kind of moral system. He contends that he didn’t have to provide a specific system, which is why my criticisms were about UHC in general rather than, say, just the UKs’s system. UHC solves the issue of uninsurance in name only, as you can see from my case it leads to worse outcomes, death, delay, and corruption, which obviously isn’t moral.—the problem is not uninsurance in itself, but a lack of medical care which is a problem that will only increase under UHC. It’s nonsensical that the US should offer its citizens a system that fails. -Obligations- Throughout the debate, I repeatedly asked Pro to explain why people are obligated to provide others with insurance, with no response. You can vote Con right here as this pretty much takes out Pros arguments. -Survival rates- Pro makes no serious response except to state that the uninsured get less care. The problem is, even with the high amount of uninsured people in the US the US still has significantly higher survival rates in critical diseases than nations with UHC. Check out the numbers and you’ll see that the 15% difference between US and UK survival rates for Cancer alone, for example, amount to around 90k people, far outweighing any impact Pro brings up, not counting other diseases the US leads in. The sheer amount of waste in UHC systems, and the shortages of doctors that will occur in the US with UHC lead to waiting lists, causing death. Remember that in the UK 21% of curable lung cancer patients become incurable while waiting for care. Pro tries to argue that the US system is riddled with medical errors, but without a comparison to nations with UHC this is entirely irrelevant in the round. Survival rates are the best way to judge the quality of care in a system since they are actual measures of the goals of the system—to deliver care. Pro says that I only mentioned 4 diseases, but these are among the leading causes of death and thus the most likely for governments to collect stats about, moreover cancer alone outweighs everything Pro has argued. Pro drops my arguments for why the WHO evidence is completely bunk. -Obamacare- Pro only argues that Obamacare doesn’t solve because it doesn’t insure everybody. The problem is, since Obamacare mandates that everyone buy insurance or pay a tax, vastly lessens the financial burden of doing so, and has more companies providing insurance via the private market. While this doesn’t insure everyone, you can see pretty clearly from this debate that insurance is no guarantee of care in countries with UHC. Pro argues I don’t explain why people uninsured under Obamacare lack it by choice but Obamacare REQUIRES people to purchase medical insurance and makes it affordable. The status quo is solving the issue of health care. -Costs- Pro argues that UHC will be cheaper. Nevermind the fact that this is empirically falsified by the vast costs of UHC systems bankrupting other countries, this is contradicted by my logic that was completely dropped about how people will waste medical care since it’s free (refer also to the evidence I gave in the UK as). I’m the only one with a verifiable study, which showed that a UHC system in the US based on the Swedish model would cost the average taxpayer $17,200. Pro argues that this is only one system, which is true, but it’s a cop out for Pro to just say “oh actually my system wouldn’t do that” without explaining what his would do. If it’s fair for Pro to not defend any specific system, it’s fair for me to level my criticisms based upon all UHC systems. Pro argues the German system is economically good, however according to WSJ[1] Germans pay 15% of their income for their system that is ""on the brink of financial shortfall"". Even Pros model system can't be properly funded. Moreover Pro provides no logic what so ever for why UHC would be cheaper. His only card argues it would be cheaper assuming: “significant systemic changes including administrative simplification, computerized physician order entry, an automated patient safety/error reporting system, reduction in inappropriate clinical practice variation, and controls of provider payments and premiums”. Face it, this isn’t going to happen and Pro hasn’t proven it will. Pros only economic impacts come from people leaving their jobs where they’re experienced and trying to start new businesses, and Pro doesn’t give you any dollar amounts of revenue that this will generate. It’s literally impossible to weigh. It’s also unfair for Pro to keep citing evidence without linking it in round for review—compare this to my 30 external sources. Thus the cost argument flows clearly to Con. From this you have increased costs of care with lower quality of care. Remember that Canadians desperate for care come to the US. My credit and heg argument stands as well. There’s no way to predict the future, but having the US acting in the exact opposite manner that S&P suggests is no way for credit success. Even if you buy his arguments that UHC is good, the risks are too high right now. -Doctor shortages- Pro never properly responds to the fact that 20% of doctors would quit if we implemented UHC, only arguing that slightly more southern doctors were polled. This however makes sense in a random sample as the south is by far the most populace region[2]. Experiences from countries with UHC also confirm the fact that doctors would quit, creating even more waiting lists. -Rationed care- Pro never provides evidence contrary to the waiting lists that occur in countries with UHC, along with the courruption that happens on these lists, and the deaths that occur while waiting for care. You never see Americans going to Canada for care, you see the opposite because a private sector solution to healthcare is clearly superior.

Sed146d2b-A9930745d	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	"C1: Taxation in General ""Some taxes are justifiable and needed, but the current tax rates are terrible"" So you and me agree that taxes are justifiable and needed. Plus, public services come from the nation as well, including regulatory protections with our environment, food, air, water, products that we buy, and other entities. The government provides many institutions we take for granted, such as our infrastructure and others I'll discuss in R4. The rich pay less than the middle class in taxes because of tax loopholes. Consider this Chart: Nation /Taxes as % of GDP/ [1]Special Mentions [2] Finland / 52.4% of GDP/Best education in world, Universal Health Care Australia / 32.3% of GDP/Strong economy, low unemployment, high ranking health care system Japan / 32.5% of GDP/Best Health Care system in world (universal), great education system Germany/43% of GDP/Strong infrastructure and competitiveness USA/14.7% of GDP/Most dynamic economy in world among large nations ---As you can tell, nations that have high enough taxation prosper, the contrary of your argument. Nations with sufficient tax levels can fund a strong system of universal health care, and can manage and have clean environments, and a better infrastructure. As you can see, lower taxes =/= stronger nation in all cases. [1, 2] America spends about 2% on infrastructure, while Europe spends 5%. This shows that higher spending here is needed. [3] So, your argument is not good economics. C2: Safety Net The safety net supports families that are poor compared to the national average. When we give the poor a full living, it is counter-productive. When we give them nothing, they are horribly in shape, and cannot get easily into the workforce and stay there because the poor usually live in a cycle of poverty, one where a person lacks the skills necessary to hold a well-paying job. The basic line: When generation after generation lives in various stages of poverty—it’s not because they have some undiscovered laziness gene. We have some serious systemic problems. [4] The current system needs to be reformed but kept. It has been concluded by several programs that when given intensive job training, supplemental earnings for a temporary time, and shifting workers into the workforce over time carefully has been successful. It is critical for prosperity. [6] C2: Wealthy have a moral obligation If society helps the wealthy become wealthy in the first place off what the taxpayers have paid for, the wealthy deserve to help the people that made that guy wealthy. Here is what Bill Gates Sr. (Bill Gates' father) said: There is no such thing as a self-made man, Bill Jr. didn't invent the internet. He just used to - to make billions. Every businessman has used vast American infrastructure, which the taxpayers paid for, to make his money. He didn't get rich alone. There is no such thing as a self-made man! Therefore, the wealthy, who've gotten rich off what the taxpayers paid for, owe the taxpayers of this country a great deal and should be paying it back. [5] If you disagree with a rich man whose son is the richest guy in the world, you currently are not looking into reality yet. C3: Money for the rich and Corporations ""if the rich received tax cuts, they could either countribue to GDP by buying a big-ticket item or go invest in his or her business(s) which will help them by getting them more money, help the workers by having better working conditions, salaries, and a reduced risk of being laid off"" As I showed, in R2, corporate profits are at record highs. However, people are still, more than usual, at a risk of being laid off. The rich received tax cuts in the early 2000s, but the economy declined. It is absurd to say this was the Clintonian policies taking affect. No evidence. The Clinton tax changes increased government revenues, eventually balancing the budget, which led to more confidence. Plus, because a business has more money, they will likely invest, but they WILL NOT INVEST IN THEIR OWN PROPERTY. This is the number one thing. Businesses never hire with more money. Businesses hire and expand with more demand. So, we need more demand to improve worker's salaries, working conditions, and make businesses truly expand, instead of just ""investing"" in Wall Street, which doesn't help Main Street by much at all. Social Safety Net Constitutionality: If you look, the Constitution was set up to allow the federal government to: Provide common national defense Establish a Justice System Insure domestic tranquility Promote the general welfare Secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, and to form a more perfect union As I have discussed, a social safety net improves the general welfare of a nation as well as makes a more perfect union. Thus, a safety net is Constitutional. Social Security The true solutions to fix this program: Lockbox Raise Cap on limits taxed If you allow workers to opt out whom are middle or lower classes, when retirement comes, they will likely need more money again, and thus you would have a crisis. Plus, if people can opt out, the wealthiest will opt out because this program is designed for the middle and lower classes. Then, with few people to support the program, the program will collapse, and hurting millions of seniors. This is a slippery slope, you allow people to opt out, then the system crashes. Inheritance Tax This tax is administered on the state level. Therefore, it depends on what the state's situation is. Property Tax: America enjoys a system of quality, Universal Public Schools, that when utilized effectively, can serve as a ""great equalizer"". The school system is considered a cornerstone in American society. Therefore, this tax is needed to fund schools. Excise Tax: I showed you how excise taxes are Constitutional in R2. Plus, excise taxes reduce the chance that people use these dangerous substances. This is different from prohabition. It increases and broadens the tax base and revenue too. Corporate Taxes: Tax Cuts don't create more jobs our anything of the sort when applied to businesses either. I just think that it would increase competitiveness, and with no loopholes, more money would possibly be collected because some businesses pay no income tax. Renewable Energy We should not be in a rush to move to renewable energy sources because it will cause a crushing recession and will slow travel down by over 95%, thus making the economy even worse. And the rich already pay more than their fair share in taxes, and the poor pay less than their fair share in taxes. Renewable enery sources would create millions of jobs, reduce greenhouse gases, clean up environments and habitats, make us no longer dependent on foreign oils, clean up air and water in this nation, prevent much childhool asthma, save thousands of lives a year, and help other third world countries if we help them develop faster and prevent them from hurting their ecosystems and environments. For every dollar we invest in them, it has a multiplier of 6. [5] So, your energy argument has no merit, and Cap and Trade actually creates new markets for trading Capped emission ""blocks"", improving the economy. Government Spending The government needs to cut spending in some areas, but has to be careful on how much they cut, and when, because the economy cannot plunge into another recession. Taxation rates, only at 14.7% of GDP, is much lower than many other nations, which are more similar to 30-50%. So, we need some tax increases as well. Sources: The World Factbook.

Saf28e840-A99353eaa	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	I’ll refute Pros case this round, defend mine in the next. Pro contends that in order to pursue our “desires” we need to be free from concerns over our health. First, UHC fails to satisfy this by actually making the health care situation worse, secondly Pro gives no warrant for this assertion-- it’s blatantly wrong. People do live fulfilling lives even in the face of adversity, and thirdly comparing a lack of insurance to starvation is nothing short of absurd. Uninsured a) Pro doesn’t tell you who these uninsured are. The fact is that the picture isn’t as bleak as he paints. According to Health and Human services[1] 37% of the uninsured have incomes over $50,000 and 40% are between the healthy ages of 18 and 34. Many of these people can afford insurance but do not have it because they don’t want and don’t need it. Thus Pros scare tactics of lots of uninsured people can’t be considered too impactful b) Pro has no solvency. We can see from my contention two that UHC delivers bad outcomes. Survival rates for most diseases are greater in the US as CATO reports[2]: “Whether the disease is cancer, pneumonia, heart disease, or AIDS, the chances of a patient surviving are far higher in the United States than in other countries. …the United States is at the top of the charts when it comes to surviving cancer… roughly 62.9 percent [of men] diagnosed with cancer survive for at least five years… 66.3 percent [for women]… Most countries with national health care fare far worse. For example, in Italy, 59.7 percent of men and 49.8 percent of women survive five years. In Spain, just 59 percent of men and 49.5 percent of women do. And in Great Britain, a dismal 44.8 percent of men and …52.7 percent of women .” Higher survival rates outweigh Pro’s 20,000 people stat. It makes sense that survival rates are lowered since people will use free health care on frivolous things like ambulance taxi cabs. c) The status quo solves. Obamacare mandates that individuals buy insurance from private corporations or face a special tax, and that large companies provide their employees with health care. This allows people who don’t want health insurance to pay a comparatively cheap fine and save the money they would’ve spent on insurance, while accomplishing the benefits of a largely insured population. Obamacare is not being fully implemented until after the 2014 elections, so there’s no reason to rush into a UHC system when we have a better system about to be put into place. d) You can turn this argument. 20% of doctors in the US would quit if we implemented UHC[3]. This means that the US would experience physician shortages like many places with UHC do such us Canada[4] or experience doctor strikes such as recent ones in the UK[5]. Thus the situation of care would become even worse as doctor shortages create waiting lists. See the UK for why waiting lists are bad. e) Pro still doesn’t explain how UHC would be better. Killing all uninsured people would also solve the issue, but would lead to obviously worse outcomes. UHC would keep people from being uninsured, but it would create worse outcomes. Pro has no evidence to dispute this. Security a) Pro is still arguing essentially that insurance is good and a lack of insurance is bad. He gives no analysis on outcomes from countries with UHC to see if they’re any better. I agree that health care is expensive and we should probably work on making vital drugs cheaper—starting by lessening patent lengths for medicines so that competition can emerge and make drugs vastly cheaper[6]. b) Pro argues no impact here. How much communicable disease spread would be lessened by UHC? How many lives would be saved? How much would local economies be revitalized? Secondly, even assuming these impacts exist, Obamacare solves. c) Pros only evidence on how UHC could save money comes from (read the comments) congressional testimony. No methodology, no sources, just the testimony of a man trying to convince congress of something. Again prefer actual outcomes and logic, UHC is bankrupting France[7] other European countries[8] and cross apply my logic on b) in the previous contention on why the costs will by inherently high. Pro gives no viable system. Self esteem a) Pro gives no warrant on why it’s someone else’s obligation to provide someone else help with their self esteem issues or any issue. Pro lists a lot of facts that people will find bad but gives no argument for why the cost of fixing them should fall onto tax payers unaffiliated with these uninsured people. b) The sick aren’t ostracized by society because they don’t have insurance, if they are “ostracized” because they’re ill and contagious. c) The bad experiences coming from being uninsured can be solved without UHC. The status quo is already solving them. d) Pro argues no quantifiable impact here. Prefer my arguments as they are backed by solid fact and determinable outcomes. e) It's unfair for Pro to argue the impact of a lack of insurance without explaining how he solves it. I can't refute a system Pro refuses to offer up, and to determine what the United States morally should do we need to determine the effects of any proposed system. It's also impossible to leap away from the status quo without any knowledge of the system you're going to be leaping into. Pros arguments rely upon vague assertions from a few people in favor of UHC, prefer my actual evidence and analysis of nations that already have UHC. You can see from my arguments that empirically the US system delivers better results, UHC fails, and the status quo is solving. We don't maximize autonomy by delivering bad otucomes. Next round I will tie together my case and my criticisms of my opponents case to explain why a Con ballot is in order.

Saf28e840-Ab937e49d	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	"A few observations: Pros argument really falls apart when applying it to his burden under the resolution--he lists problems in the current system but offers us no mechanism to repair these flaws; he presumes UHC will solve these issues, but really his advocacy amounts to ""health care is good, lack of health care is bad"". From where does it follow that a UHC system is the solution? I understand that my opponent doesn't want to defend a very specific system so the debate doesn't get into technicalities, but he needs to at least argue how a system of UHC would solve the problem. Government isn't the answer to everything, my opponent must prove that it is in this case. Case On principle? My opponent didn't rush to define what on principle meant--I argue that a fundamental principle of government is to act in it's citizens best interest, and if implementing UHC is contrary to that goal it ought not, on principle, be implemented. I. Worst possible time My opponent is advocating government run insurance at the absolute worst possible time. The US government is already reaching un-real levels of debt, inducing panic among the population and political gridlock that has crippled the US government. UHC would only increase the fiscal burden. Moreover the number of seniors (who need care the most) is currently rising[1] and the existing US safety net is on the verge of a complete meltdown. Worse still, while debt is ever increasing, the US credit horizon is looking increasingly gloomy. ForexLive reports[2] S&P's position on US credit: “U.S. sovereign credit risks, primarily political and fiscal, could build to the point of leading us to lower our ‘AA+’ long-term rating by 2014.”. S&P thinks there's about a 1-in 3 chance they'll have to downgrade the US credit rating even after the 2011 budget control act, and that probability will vastly increase if the government takes on a huge entitlement program while failing to maintain the ones it has. S&P explains that unless the US implements: “a credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation plan that represents significant (even if gradual) fiscal tightening”, they will probably downgrade it further. The impact of a downgrade is horrible. Economics professor Charles Rowley warns that if S&P or Moodys further downgrade U.S. credit ratings [3]: ""[This would] throw into question the privileged status of U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven for global investors. Any significant flight from Treasuries would raise Treasury bond rates, with crippling consequences for the economy. A 1-percentage point increase in rates would raise Treasury debt payments by $1 trillion over the next decade, wiping out the benefits of all the budget cuts enacted by Congress last year."" The US government serves it's citizens best and secures their autonomy most by remaining the hegemon able to secure it's interests, but UHC will deter this. The perception is that the US is in a state of decline, as Mark Steyn argues in an article posted yesterday[4] ""The assumption that we are in the early stages of “the post-American world” is now shared by everyone from General Sisi to Vladimir Putin."" As the US and its allies continue to wallow in their debt and budget/trade deficits, China and Russia are becoming increasingly more aggressive and imperialistic. Much of Africa, the untapped gem of the world, is under Chinese economic hegemony[5]. The US faces the loss of it's position in the world, and consequently an inability to secure it's citizens interests abroad, if it does not tighten it's fiscal belt. The US's coercive power is just as much determined by its economic might as it is it's military muscle, and UHC will weaken the economy. Moreover even if these impacts are proven false by my opponent, the fact of gridlock remains. In order to pass UHC, Obama and Congressional democrats would have to sacrifice all the political capital they have. This means that sensible pieces of the democratic agenda such as tightening gun laws so that terrorists can't buy guns[6] and immigration reform are less likely to pass, along with other legislation that's vital to national objectives. To advocate such a massive change in such a tumultuous time is absurd. II. Empirical results I'll get more into this when addressing my opponents arguments, but experiences of UHC from other nations have been nothing short of disastrous. Waiting times for care are vast, in England 21% of curable lung cancer patients become incurable while waiting for health care[7]. In Canada, nearly 900,000 people are on the waiting list of care at any time[8]. People will use up all health care resources available since they do not have to pay for them; also in Canada[9]: ""Only half of ER patients are treated in a timely manner by national and international standards"". This is bad since ER patients usually need help immediately (compare the US, with a mean emergency room waiting time of 58 minutes[10] to Canada's mean time of four hours[11]). Since ambulances are free, the British use them as Taxis with 91% of ambulance visits being for non emergency purposes[12]. Moreover waiting lists for care in countries with UHC are incredibly corrupt, with the rich and influential often jumping places ahead of others in Japan[12] and Canada[13] where ""research reveals that cardiovascular surgery queues are routinely jumped by the famous and politically-connected"". Pro needs to provide some safeguards against these abuses or explain how the US wouldn't suffer from them. Until then, you negate. My opponent argues in the abstract, I argue actual results.

S14e017ba-A76812244	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Before I start this debate, I will say that I defend the resolution, while Con defends a private health care system. I request that in the last round, Con doesn't add any new arguments. I will do my best to win this debate. Single-Payer Health Care System in USA would: Restore true competition to medical providers Increase innovation Be More Efficient Decrease total costs Coverage of all citizens Improve quality of care Improve national economy C1: Restore true competition to medical providers There are two different areas where competition exists in healthcare, 1) payers, and 2) providers. With private insurance payers, there are a lack of choices for the consumers. The reason is to make the insurance company gain a profit. It gives too much power to the administrators instead of the actual medical experts. It is offensive to medical experts as well, as well as the people who have their loved ones die because of these choices. In a Single-Payer system, people can go to any provider of health care in the nation. It would be much more efficient. Medical decisions are left to the patient and doctor, as it should be. It is also Capitalistic, because medical professionals would be still forced to make good decisions in health treatment, or else they will lose patients. Health providers get profits still in a Single-Payer system, and doctors still are well paid. Therefore, Single-Payer would restore true healthy competition to medical providers. [1] [2] C2: Increase Innovation Currently under HMO/ insurance payer system, grants payed towards medical research and reduced, and with much higher costs in the private system, innovation is less than what is would be in a Single Payer system. Plus, with the commericialization of research, innovation is stifled. With little to no commercialization of research, and with much more funding, as well as more research, a Single Payer system would increase innovation in healthcare. [3] C3: Be More Efficient The United States has the most bureaucratic health care system in the world. Over 31% of every health care dollar goes to paperwork, overhead, CEO salaries, profits, etc. Because the U.S. does not have a unified system that serves everyone, and instead has thousands of different insurance plans, each with its own marketing, paperwork, enrollment, premiums, and rules and regulations, our insurance system is both extremely complex and fragmented. [3] Typical HMO's have about 15-25% of total costs directed just to administrative costs. Medicare, a form of a single-payer healthcare system for the elderly, costs about 3-6 percent in total administrative costs. [3] [5] With a larger economy of scale, costs would be even lower for administrative costs. Plus, with a single-payer system, health records are much more streamlined, and would make shuffling paperwork unnecessary since records can be recorded in a electronic way. With much more electronic, streamlined recording, much less spending on paper-shuffling and much less spending on administrative costs, and by lowering bureaucracy, a Single-Payer healthcare system would be much more efficient, modern, would be more affordable, and cover all fairly and effectively. C4: Decrease Total Costs With a Single-Payer system, everybody is covered with high quality insurance. Experts have said that the USA could cover all medically indicated care for all citizens without additional expenditures, because current insurance premiums, as well as administrative costs, could be shifted to care instead. [5] [6] Paul Krugman, a famous economist and Nobel Prize winner, called the Single-Payer system, ""good economics"", and wrote, ""The great advantage of universal, government-provided health insurance is lower costs... Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance."" Krugman also has pointed out that the savings of single-payer would be ""far more than the cost of covering all those now uninsured."" [7] [5] The gov't of Colorado hired the Lewin Group Technical Assessment to analyze how well several different health-care proposals might work for the state, and the result from the group was that the ""single-payer plan was the only one that would achieve universal coverage and also save money - about $1.4 billion a year. "" [8] [5] The government will also not need to pay for profits, marketing, shuffling paperwork, higher adminstrative costs, etc. Plus, with more directed funding, the per capita spent on healthcare would drop, as quality improves as well. If you look at other nation's spending on healthcare per citizen, many get better care for lower costs. For example, look at France, the nation with the top ranking healthcare, the USA spends twice as much, but is 36 spots behind in healthcare. This represents that a Single-Payer system is needed. [4] C5: Coverage of All Citizens A single-payer healthcare system covers all citizens with quality healthcare. C6: Improves Quality of Care Health Insurance companies usually base decisions based on coverage, restrictions, and costs, and what will make the company prosper. This does not equal great care, and may even conflict with that. [5] A single-payer program can allolocate resources based on the two vital parties in a healthcare scenario: the patients and the providers. Plus, Single-Payer plans in the USA, such as Medicare, show that the patients have higher levels of satisfaction with coverage and access to care than people to private insurance. [5] Plus, France has the top-ranking healthcare in the world, and is a Single-Payer system, and has a comprehensive plan for all citizens. However, it only has to pay HALF of what the USA does. The USA is only in place 37, but is number 1 for spending. [9] C7: Improves National Economy States and other businesses would have to pay less on medical care for their workers. Right now, American workers also have to compete with foreign businesses which nation's have universal health care. For example, in 2006, health care for workers added $1,500 to the price of a medium size care, while the cost in Japan was about $500. This, as well as other reasons including a cut in HALF OF BANKRUPTCIES due to a lack of medical insurance, and lower costs by a Single-Payer system, would help the economy. [4] [5] I will discuss in a different round how a Single-Payer system would be funded for. Conclusions: A Single-Payer Healthcare system would have huge benefits for the USA. A Health Planning board, if included (I debate Pro for this being the primary government body of execution of healthcare) would decide on what treatments, medications and services should be covered, based on community needs and medical science, and allocate capital for major new investments based on assessments of where need is greatest. Plus, coverage would be universal for a Single-Payer healthcare system. Quality would absolutely improve for all. Medical records could be streamlined in an efficient way. The national economy would get a boost with 1/2 of bankruptcies removed, and with much lower costs, businesses would be more competitive, and have more funds available. It also modernizes the USA, helps all our citizens, and returns legitimate healthcare competition to the providers and patients, while the government facilitates better health care for all.

Saf28e840-A52b4505	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	I’ll defend my own case, then go onto Pros. Pro disputes that he actually has to provide solvency. This is ridiculous. Ought does connate morality, which is why we need to discuss what actually happens if we implement UHC and if those are moral outcomes. Blankly asserting that having health insurance is good doesn’t come anywhere near justifying a radical change in the status quo. My case I. Timing a) Pro accuses me of not drawing a direct link to UHC when it comes to the importance of fiscal discipline. It’s pretty obvious that taking on a behemoth welfare institution when we can’t afford the ones we have doesn’t count as the fiscal tightening S&P advised. b) Pro misunderstands the probability argument. In the status quo even with Obama’s superior plan in place US finances are so incredibly bad that there’s a 33% chance of a further downgrade. Implementing a massive spending program is going to increase this by a huge margin and is opposite to what S&P suggests. c) Pro drops the rising number of seniors and the meltdown occurring in the current US welfare system. The US government is so gridlocked and incompetent it can’t even handle something as simple as social security, let alone extensive UHC. d) Pro drops the impact of US losing hegemony and how this hurts autonomy. He can lose the debate here alone, because his value is undermined by spending enough to cause a further downgrade. e) Pro’s supposed boons to the economy are all flawed and don’t outweigh. He gives no empirical evidence (and hence no way to weigh) the impact of job lock, and I could flatly deny his 3.8 million number for lack of documentation. As it stands, he explains no methodology and no impact for why self employment will save the economy. His ER response is flatly wrong. 89% of people who visit the ER have some kind of insurance, ER visits represent only 2% of total health spending[4], and ER’s are not more expensive because they’re inefficient, it’s because they involve emergency care. Average doctor visits involve things like check ups and medicine for the common cold. II. Empirics a) Pro drops literally every statistic I cited. Prefer my statistics to his since he doesn’t have any, and extend them all. Extend the waiting times, deaths, corruption, and waste/abuse. This is highly significant, better outcomes don’t occur under UHC systems. b) Pro argues that WHO ranks nations with UHC higher, as if that proves anything. WHO rankings are bunk[5] and rank factors irrelevant to quality such as inequality and life expectancy, which is effected by homicide rates, accidents and other factors . If Pro wants to argue that systems of UHC are good, he needs to provide his own stats and refute mine; remember that the US is number 1 in survival rates. c) Pro argues the reason the Canadian health care system is bad is because it isn’t getting enough funding, yet somehow believes a system in the US, who’s finances and welfare system are in vastly worse shape than Canada’s, won’t also suffer a lack of funding. Recall also that part of Canadas issue is a doctor shortage, a problem that will exist in the US under UHC. d) Pro argues that the wealthy in the US get better treatment. No doubt, but our system also doesn’t assign people onto waiting lists and then allow the rich to jump ship on them, leaving the middle class to die. Canadians desperate for care come to the US where they can pay for their medicine in cash [6]. Better to have some treatment than none due to the rationing of care under UHC. unequal care is better than no care, as poor people on waiting lists get. e) Pro’s final, extensive card is simply arguing once again that being uninsured is bad. Some of these impacts are solved by lowering drug costs by decreasing patent lengths, and remember that Obamacare is helping the poor with insurance. Pros numbers are outweighed by the horrible results of countries that actually have UHC; recall also that Pro has never justified why people should be obligated to pay for the care of others. Opponents case a) Pro argues against my statistics showing how many uninsured are uninsured by their own choice by exaggerating the costs of healthcare. However, nothing approaching the entire costs of healthcare are not pushed upon the populace. The average cost for a family under employer coverage (which is how most people in the US get coverage) is $4,316[1]. Compare this to the cost that could occur under UHC, by some estimates as high as $17,200 a year in taxation for a median income household[2]. Moreover even for Americans buying insurance on the market, a 4 person household with an income of $50,000 would only pay around $3-3,500[3] after government subsidies and tax credits. Obamas private sector solution is superior, as it allows people who don’t want insurance to opt out by paying a tax and provides increased subsidies to help the poor buy health insurance on the market. b) Pro tries to argue that I “only” mentioned 4 diseases where the US leads in survival rates (compared to 0 in UHC countries), unfortunately for Pro Cancer and Heart disease are the top two reasons of death[7] and Pneumonia is also in the top 10. The 15% difference in cancer survival rates between the US and UK, for example, amount to nearly 90k lives annually—far greater than my opponents stats. c) Pros arguments about uninsruance under Obamacare are bunk--not only are they unverifiable estimates, but most of the people would be unisnured by choice. d) Pro basically drops my survey--he argues falsely that the company comissioning it surveyed southern doctors, and argues that since that group was against UHC clearly the survey is baised. Logic doesnt work this way, Pro needs to prove some methodological flaw. UHC would lead to doctor shortages and consequently waiting lists and death.

S2d55d1c3-A3dc0bc94	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"I would like to point out that my opponent, while recognizing that there are other services needed for a long and happy life, still affirms the position that the only essential Government services are law enforcement, the courts, and defense. But this has been proven wrong on an international level. In other countries, the Governments are able to provide quality education and health care. For example, most other developed countries spend less of their GDP per capita on healthcare, and still attain universal coverage (http://www.politico.com...). My opponent argues that competition in the healthcare sector drives quality up and prices down. While this maybe true in the general marketplace, the United States (before and after the Affordable Care Act was passed) still spends more for healthcare per person as shown above. It is true that the US uses a lot of expensive equipment for health care, but the price discrepancy is still a problem. It is important to make the distinction between total spending, and spending per person. Total spending does go up with higher population, but the same is not necessarily true with spending per person. My opponent makes the common claim that people in countries with universal health care sometimes go to the United States for care. While this may be true for people with a lot of money that can afford our system, they are the exceptions, and not the rules. Many Americans have actually been going to countries with universal health care, such as Canada, and the United Kingdom (http://www.nytimes.com...) due to the problems with the American system. Almost nobody in Canada or Europe advocate free market healthcare, and many advise the US to adopt a single-payer system. My opponent affirms that very few people had access to education before public schools were widespread. However, I would like to point out that a very likely reason why attendance to private schools outmatches those of public school, is because many kids were working in farms, or in factories. Many times, only kids born into rich families had the time to go to school. The argument that private industry can provide schooling for lower overall economic cost seems legitimate until you consider the social conditions of many people in the working class. Some families can't afford education at all, and there will be few charity schools that would provide education for free. As it stands, even various Church groups who pride themselves on assistance for the poor have tuition rates at thousands of dollars a year (http://www.ncea.org...) There is no such thing as a free lunch, but sometimes it is better to use taxes in order to pay that lunch off for somebody in need. Private industry has a tendency to distribute wealth from bottom to top if left unregulated. Soup kitchens will still exist, but the millions of Americans who currently depend off of food stamps (http://www.nbcnews.com...) will be cut off. While it is ideal to help these people get back to high-paying work, it is not ideal to end the food stamp program. Regarding monopolies, my opponent still affirms the positions that Government regulation is unneeded because of the nature of the marketplace. However, the nature of businesses who are big/powerful enough to monopolize is to make profit. So businesses will collaborate with each other in order to provide people the illusion of competition, when in reality they are dealing with a hidden monopoly. While the Government may not always answer to the public, every country that my opponent mentions (DPRK, USSR, Nazi Germany, the Philippines under Marcos, PRC, Iraq) did not allow the people to have a voice in their Government. Canada, the UK, Modern Germany, the US, Japan, South Korea, etc. all have representative democracies/republics, with the people having a say in their Government. I only claimed that the Government should help only the needy with regards to food and housing, everything else should be universal. The reason why food/housing are the exceptions is the private industry has been proven to work well providing those services to those well-off (not the poor). The second premise remains affirmed. My opponent claims that I am arguing that ""all businesses will underpay their employees when possible."" I have never said nor implied that. I was simply referring to the working class have a strong tendency to be underpaid, as evidenced during pre-Progressive Era time period. The law should protect these workers. Of course computer programmers won't earn minimum wage due to value and competition. They are not of the low-wage professions. My opponent claims that the reason for employees making low wages during the industrial revolution is because of slow initial wealth creation. However, the fact still stands that during the early 1900's, most Americans lived in relative (not absolute) poverty. After the Progressive Era, and especially AFTER (not during) the New Deal of the 1930's-1940's, poverty took a dramatic turn downward. Government regulation was one of the main reasons for this. While the New Deal did not fix the Depression, it provided many Americans with poverty relief. While the property rights system may work, it would be a financial burden to both corporations and the people due to the hassles of the legal process. Too much money would be spent on lawsuits. It is best to instate a universal law to let businesses beforehand they are not allowed to harm the environment. I affirm my opponents stance that you should be able to build a house on your own property if it is a wetland, as it is a danger only to yourself, and not universally to others. If regulation of the kind I am proposing were to lead to oppressive Government, wouldn't that same standard apply to other countries with environmental regulation? Many nations that score high on the economic freedom index (http://www.heritage.org...) have proper regulations in place. The ever changing force of the marketplace doesn't always protect against monopolies. Legislation meant to break trusts up actually encourages business because it gives them the assurance that monopolies/trusts will not harm their business, providing the people who run it with relief."

S3cd3a05e-A82a1ff8f	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"Freedom is a better value than economic equality Governments enact policies to bring values to fruition. We know the policies that lead to prosperity. Prosperity comes from accumulation of wealth, a willingness to take risk to achieve rewards, and free market by which investment can be expressed. Government acts to value prosperity when it's policies support savings, investment, and free markets. Prosperity can also derive from good fortune, like happening to have significant oil reserves, but our debate is about governments expressing values as policies, not about being lucky. We also know how to achieve economic equality with certainty. It is to take money away from investment and redistribute it. Governments can and do achieve equality through poverty, but prohibiting accumulation of wealth and investment. However, suppressing free markets and redistributing wealth is not as easy as it seems. Redistribution of wealth always involves a ruling class that controls the redistribution. So in North Korea there are perhaps 40,000 people who live well and about 24 million who share the equality of poverty. At root, this debate is about whether a ruling elite should be established to redistribute wealth according to what the elite values. We should not. The redistribution premise is wrong What is the motivation for wanting to redistribute wealth? The starting point is that people have a right to do as they wish: to save and invest in risky ventures or not, to spend their time managing risks or not, and to use their earnings as they see fit. So what is the grounds for interfering with the economic lives of individuals. Saying it's for fairness begs the question. In Monty Python skit, a Robin Hood character redistributes lupines, robbing lupines from the rich and giving them to the poor. The joke is that the robin Hood character believes that equal distribution of lupines is important. The people receiving lupines are perplexed. The premise of redistributing wealth is that happiness is proportional to wealth. Every liberal and most non-liberals believe that, but studies do not confirm the premise. The part that is true is that if people lack basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter then they are very unhappy. They get happier up to the point where their basic needs are met. Impoverished Zimbabwe under dictatorial rule is the saddest place on earth. But beyond the basics, added wealth produces very little increase in happiness. Many studies support this conclusion, Wikipedia summarizes ""Historically, economists have said that well-being is a simple function of income. However, it has been found that once wealth reaches a subsistence level, its effectiveness as a generator of well-being is greatly diminished."" [6. http://en.wikipedia.org... supported y their ref 8]. Science Daily reports ""While most people believe that having more income would make them happier, Princeton University researchers have found that the link is greatly exaggerated and mostly an illusion."" [7. http://tinyurl.com...] What is the most important in determining happiness? ""Of perhaps utmost importance, nearly all the nations in the top 10 are adept at fostering entrepreneurship and opportunity. Legatum’s researchers concluded that a country’s ranking in this area is the clearest proxy of its overall ranking in the index."" [8. http://tinyurl.com...] Economic policy should therefore not be aimed at redistributing wealth to achieve economic equality. It should be aimed to raise as many people as possible above the level of satisfying basic needs. that is done through permitting free markets to operate and in fostering entrepreneurship. Forcing economic equality diminishes wealth The Gini index is one measure of economic equality. It's applied to both incomes and to wealth. Let's look at income first. Con claims that equality of wealth correlates with prosperity. That's wrong because correlation does not prove causation. Dictatorial regimes concentrate wealth and control markets resulting in poverty. Free markets produce wealth by investing accumulated capital and produce prosperity. The proof lies in examining the economies of America, China, and India. According to Wikipedia [8. http://en.wikipedia.org...] the United States Gini Index for incomes was 45 in 1929. During the Depression, equality increased along with poverty, reaching 37.6 immediately after WWII. From 1947 to 1990, inequality increased slightly, rising to 42.6 in 1990. Poverty decreased. The booming 90s brought inequality to 46.2. Since 2000, inequality has been about the same, ending the decade at 46.8. In the U.S., unemployment and poverty declined during the 90s as inequality increased, and stayed about the same until the the onset of the current recession. [9. http://www.infoplease.com...] Overall, poverty rates have declined since the 1960s, while inequality increased. Unemployment mostly responds to short term recessions and booms. In other countries, the most interesting cases are China and India. They are the most interesting because the economies are large, and the policies with respect to inequality have changed significantly. India operated as a democratic socialist state until the past few decades, and while China remains authoritarian, they have abandoned communist economic ideals and permitted much more free market activity in the past. In both countries, inequality has risen significantly in the past few decades, and prosperity has risen dramatically. After WWII, famines plagued both India and China. Freeing markets produced a significant increase in living standards. People are much happier not facing famine than being equal in poverty. Small countries in Europe are generally not good examples because they are often dominated by special circumstances. Norway received major income from North Sea oil, producing increased prosperity. Sweden became prosperous with near-libertarian economic policies, and is now coasting in slow decline. Respected Swedish parliamentarian Johnny Munkhammar writes: ""…Sweden is not socialist. According to the World Values Survey and other similar studies, Sweden combines one of the highest degrees of individualism in the world, solid trust in well-functioning institutions, and a high degree of social cohesion. Among the 160 countries studied in the Index of Economic Freedom, Sweden ranks 21st, and is one of the few countries that increased its economic freedoms during the financial crisis."" [10. http://tinyurl.com...] Tiny Luxembourg has an unusual economic situation from specialization in international banking and exotic steel making. I see nothing about any efforts to redistribute wealth. [11. http://tinyurl.com...] The Gini Index for wealth is more interesting that the Index for income. What's interesting is the seemingly random relationship between concentration of wealth. [12. http://tinyurl.com...] Rich countries like Denmark (.808) and the USA (.801)have high concentrations of wealth, but so do some of the poorest countries like Namibia (.847) and Zimbabwe (.845). Some countries with low concentrations of wealth are well off. like Japan (.547) and others are relatively poor, like China (.550). What counts is how much wealth is invested. The Japanese have extraordinarily high personal savings rates, from which they derive investment. Third world dictators are accumulating wealth but not investing it. Policies should be directed at prosperity Redistribution of wealth does not raise people out of poverty, prosperity achieved through free markets does. Free markets can stand fairly heavy taxation, but they clearly succeed in spite of that, not because of it. Economic policy should aim to raise people out of poverty, through free markets. People are happier not being in poverty, and everyone is happier enjoying economic freedom."	CON	26
S3cd3a05e-Af71844b0	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"I thank my opponent for his definitions. Here's my case. The Great Prosperity Experiment Back when Henry Ford was still around, and the ideas of industrialists like Fredrick Taylor were still cool, the aim of managers - both at a national level and at a business level - was to optimise productivity, and by extension, prosperity. They called it ""scientific management"" because they applied scientific learning and axioms to find new ways to increase their prosperity as much as possible. The great thing was that it worked wherever it was implemented. After Tsar Nicholas II demolished the Russian economy, Vladimir Lenin turned to scientific management to provide a solution, and Russia rebuilt itself. After German hyperinflation, Adolf Hitler also used scientific management, and the German economy started working again. And just like Hitler and Stalin, Henry Ford used scientific management (even if he didn't call it that), inventing one of the most productive systems known to man. Russia went from poverty to prosperity. Germany went from poverty to prosperity. People in US cities where there were major production lines, such as Michigan, saw their production soar as well. As a result, the average income increased dramatically in all of these cases. The crucial thing about all of these experiments was that they failed. Neither governments nor businesses could successfully manage to create an economy based on trying to maximise average incomes, and it was always for the same reason. Lenin did increase average income dramatically, but it came with the cost of equality, in effect creating the very opposite of the socialist ideal (http://www.wsws.org...). Hitler also increased average income, but again at the cost of equality (http://en.wikipedia.org...). And Henry Ford faced the wrath of the unions - Ford even hired boxers to physically assault employees who were suspected union members, but eventually had to succumb to the inevitable reality that without worker support his business would fail. What were the unions so upset about? You guessed it - inequality. They didn't want Ford to have too much dominance over the labour market, creating lots of unemployed while paying his workers so well as to create a class system wherever he operated. The Radical Alternative My claim is that government exists to preserve the interests of all the people, not just an elite. According to the IMF (http://en.wikipedia.org...(PPP)_per_capita) the countries that do best at that are countries like Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore and Norway. It's no surprise that on the UN's Human Development Index, which my opponent cited, all of these countries are listed as having ""very high"" human development. On the Satisfaction of Life Index he cited, Luxembourg and Norway are among the best in the world, and Singapore and Qatar are each in the top 10 for their world-region. Why? Perhaps the answer lies in the Gini coefficients. Gini coefficients measure statistical dispersion of wealth, with zero meaning wealth is perfectly equal. If you arrange the world's countries by Gini coefficient (http://en.wikipedia.org...), you get (with only a few outliers because the data is somewhat older) something that looks suspiciously like the Satisfaction of Life Index. The answer is clear - equality leads to happiness. But as Hitler, Stalin and Ford have shown us, prosperity does not lead to happiness. There is another force at work here. Equality leads not only to happiness, but also to prosperity. The idea that equality is means everyone is poor is completely unfounded, for two reasons. First, companies are likely to invest in places with high equality, because if people are happy there, then company employees want to be in on that happiness. This investment brings money into the economy, increasing the average wage. Secondly, when people are being paid a fair wage relative to their output, there is an incentive for everybody to increase their output. In an unequal society, there is no incentive on those who are suffering poor working conditions and low wages to work harder, because they'll still be in poverty. This increase in work translates to an increase in prosperity and an increase in the value of money - and assuming we see GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity (which is a wise idea, since otherwise my opponent is arguing hyperinflation is the best macroeconomic policy), that means more prosperity. The choice for governments is simple - choose to promote equality and bring your people prosperity, or choose to promote prosperity and some of your people will fall to ruin. Which should government choose? My belief is that the latter is hands-down better, both for the people of the government and the government itself. For the people of the government, happiness is the ultimate goal, and it is equality that brings happiness, not prosperity. For the government itself, when their people are unequal, that reflects back on them, especially since they'd be creating the inequality by pushing for prosperity. How does this translate into reality? Well, first it means employers need to be fair. If one person has to do more of the same work to earn the same wage, then clearly that's inequality, a point that feminism has been raising for a few decades now. Con argues that this is independent of standard of living - to some extent he is right, but it does help determine one's standard of living. Would you rather work for Ford and get beat up by a boxer in order to earn your wages, or work at some other factory and earn the same wages under good working conditions? Everyone would at least agree that the two scenarios do not have an equal standard of living attached to them, so clearly it's not completely independent. Governments must ensure there are fair conditions in factories, both in terms of wages and conditions. Con also makes the assertion that fairness is completely subjective. This is true only when one considers future policy - in hindsight it is easy to see what policies led to a fair outcome and what policies didn't. I will admit that politicians, like all people, sometimes get it wrong, and in the interests of fairness push policy that's incredibly unfair. That doesn't mean, however, that governments should not push for economic equality. That's a great argument for telling governments to learn from their mistakes, something which I wholeheartedly support. I also agree that unemployment is a concern to both of our cases, but I think my opponent's criticism is directed at my too general use of words. Let me qualify it therefore by saying that where I said unemployment, I meant the involuntary part of it. Involuntary unemployment is not equal as it polarises society, with some stuck on some government safety net while others get ahead. This is particularly pernicious because it's always the poor who end up getting laid off first. Again, I don't think this will be a point of clash since we both agree on the policy, so I'll move right along. Finally con argues that a significant minimum wage always increases unemployment. In the long term, I argue that societies that maintain a high minimum wage maintain equality, and thereby create prosperity. This can be seen in many of the European nations, such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which have the highest minimum wages in the world and yet very low unemployment (The Netherlands has the lowest in the EU right now). In the short term, there is a small jump, but this can be almost entirely attributed to employers not feeling so bad about firing their employees, as they have less dependence on their jobs. After a while they realise how stupid this philosophy is, because without skilled employees their businesses will not get far. The basic idea is that equality works."	PRO	27
Sf08ced27-Ae319c236	Smoking should be banned	PURPOSE: This debate is about whether or not smoking should be banned. DEFINITIONS: Smoking-The act of smoking tobacco Banned-To disallow ARGUMENTS: 1. The government should keep people from harm This argument is constructed in the following way: Premise 1: The government should choose actions that, on balance, minimize the harm to its citizens and provide a benefit for its society. Premise 2: If an action has to be banned (e.g. murder) to achieve the goal, it ought to be banned. Premise 3: Banning smoking points towards the goal. Conclusion: Smoking should be banned. Justification for premise 3: Smoking negatively affects society by causing deaths through second-hand smoke, [1] and it may raise tax rates in countries with universal health care. 2. The government has a right to limit what people do to their bodies Banning smoking is more beneficial to society, in general, because it reduces the dangers of second hand smoking. Even though it may restrict certain rights, it is, from a utilitarian perspective, superior to not banning smoking. If the government does not have a right to limit what people do to their bodies, then indecent exposure and smoking illegal drugs would both be legal. Also, even assuming that the government does not have the right to restrict what people do if it only affects them, the government should be allowed to ban smoking since it affects others, and therefore does fall under the scope of civil rights. This is because second hand smoking can affect others, as second hand smoke contains many harmful carcinogens, and has caused the death of 2.5 million non-smokers since 1964. [1] Smoking also affects society in other ways, too. For example, smoking can raise tax rates in places with universal health care because of the diseases it causes which can otherwise be averted by banning smoking. This means that “the government does not have the right to choose what I can do with my own body” is not a valid rebuttal, as smoking affects non-smokers, so it is not necessarily a right. 3. Many illegal substances like marijuana are banned, and smoking is more harmful than these substances The government has banned many other illegal substances, and by the same logic tobacco should be banned. This is because tobacco is more harmful than marijuana, and as stated before, affects non-smokers. “In summary, this study showed little, if any effect of marijuana use on non-AIDS mortality in men and on total mortality in women. The increased risk of AIDS mortality in male marijuana users probably did not reflect a causal relationship, but most likely represented uncontrolled confounding by male homosexual behavior. The risk of mortality associated with marijuana use was lower than that associated with tobacco cigarette smoking.”[2] 4. Tobacco smoking is an unnecessary risk Unlike vehicles or other things that cause mortalities, tobacco smoking is an unnecessary risk because it does not create anything productive. Continuing from Premise 1 of section 1, because tobacco has little productive purpose and a lot of harm, the benefits of banning it outweighs the negative effects. [1] http://www.cdc.gov...

Saf28e840-A79d945d1	The U.S. ought to guarantee Universal Healthcare to its citizenry	"I will be addressing Con""s remarks, and them emphasizing some key themes in the debate. SOLVENCY Firstly, as ought is a question about morality, and as morality doesn""t necessarily imply a discussion of the consequences, I maintain I do not need to prove solvency. I would also point out that we began this debate with an understanding that ""Pro does not have to pick a specific type of UHC to support, nor does it need to offer a policy to implement it."" However, if this argument does not convince you, I can still solve the problem. Here""s how: (1) Uninsurance is a grave problem; (2) UHC largely eliminates uninsurance (more so than Obamacare); (3) Conclusion: UHC solves for uninsurance and its attendant problems. This is a very clear train of logic. My opponent claims that asserting the need for insurance doesn""t solve. Yet, that is ultimately what the debate is about""is insurance necessary and moral. By asserting and demonstrating how insurance is necessary and useful, I am affirming the resolution. Finally, if insurance will eliminate the problems outlined in my initial statement, and its harms don""t very much outweigh those gains, that I have solved. CON""S TIMING ARGUMENT (a) Con doesn""t draw a direct link between UHC and economic hardship""her only rebuttal to this is that it is ""pretty obvious"" that UHC will hinder economic success. Yet, I find this assumption dubious, especially in light of the Murray and Thorpe evidence that shows the UHC will have a clear benefit to the economy. There is also a second reason to reject the Con""s argument. Because we""re not debating any specific form of UHC, the government, depending on the plan it may put together, could devise a means of funding it that would have little (if any) negative economic impact. (b) She says that implementing UHC will increase the likelihood of a credit down grade be a ""huge margin,"" but fails to explain what that margin is or why that increase is inevitable. If that margin means that the likelihood of a downgrade rises to 40%, then there is still a 60% chance that UHC will not result in the harms she mentions. In which case, we would have few harms, but many benefits through a reduction in uninsurance. This is a strong cost-benefit justification for the solvency and the utility of UHC. Ultimately, her assertion of a ""huge margin"" of increase is vague and ill-defined, and we cannot vote of such nebulous suppositions. As Con put it, there is ""no empirical evidence (and hence no way to weigh) the impact"" of such a vague, undefined threat. We shouldn""t sacrifice the clear benefits of UHC for a threat that isn""t even quantified. (c) Again, since we""re not talking about any particular form of UHC, it is unfair to say that UHC would necessarily fail in the U.S. Plus, there are other ways of coping with rising seniors""like raising retirement ages, etc. Ultimately, though, we""re discussing UHC not Medicare. (d) In fact, I did NOT drop her hegemony argument. This point was predicated on the notion that because UHC would harm our economy, we would be hampered in our efforts to have hegemony. So, if her economics arguments are fallacious, then her hegemony argument loses its footing and its supporting logic. Furthermore, I did note that Rowley never directly explained why UHC would deter/impede our attempts to attain hegemonic status. (e) The 3.8 million stat offered by my source was compiled by the Dept. of Health and Human Services in a meta-analysis of 178 different, independent studies of the healthcare field. And it is not my argument that entrepreneurship will ""save"" the economy, but merely that it is good for the economy. It prevents stagnation and promotes investment. As Con stated, ""it""s pretty obvious.""Furthermore, her 89% evidence did not actually respond to my argument, which was not about how many uninsured visited the emergency room. Rather, my argument was that 10.7% of visits were from non-emergencies, likely cause by a lack of insurance or underinsurance. See also misconstrues my argument about ER costs; regardless of why the ER is more expensive (which it is), its high prices have a detrimental impact on the uninsured, who are often forced to go to the ER rather than another physician. Furthermore, the Con accuses me of providing a lack of methodology, when the sum total of her source""s methodology regarding ER costs is citing: ""A growing body of research."" CON""S EMPIRICS ARGUMENT (a) I do not drop the Con""s statistics""I explain why they can be set aside or why they are incorrect. I offer statistics that actually contradict what the Con argues (e.g. the WHO evidence.) I explain that she only cites a handful of examples, which cannot speak to UHC as a whole; the results of 3 or 4 nations do not necessarily characterize the scores of UHC programs around the globe. She claims the U.S. has the highest survival rate, but I addressed this in Round Three when I stated, ""My opponent then claims that the U.S. has better care, and extrapolates from that that UHC delivers bad outcomes because it delivers poor care for ""most diseases."" Her own source states that this is a comparison of ""specific diseases."" In fact, she only mentions 4 diseases, which is hardly ""most."" Furthermore, her own Cato source states, ""although the U.S. health care system can provide the world""s highest quality of care, that quality is often uneven. The Institute of Medicine estimates that some 44,000 and 90,000 annual deaths are due to medical errors, while a study in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that only a little more than half of American hospital patients receive the clinical standard of care."" Also, the uninsured wait 1.5x longer for care (I stated this in round two,) beating back her wait times argument because wait times either way would be problematic, and they receive worse care. (b) Again, the U.S. system could easily implement a more easily maintained system of UHC than Canada, particularly as we""re not talking about any particular form of UHC. Furthermore, many other UHC nations have, like Germany, as I noted earlier in the debate, have successful systems the U.S. could model. (c) Care ""rationing"" does not occur in all forms of UHC. Canada is a flawed example, and care does happen in UHC. She says that people receive not care because the rich skip ahead. This really is warranted, especially insofar as ""wait times"" do not mean ""no care."" The rich will abuse either system, and as yet, she has offered no evidence as to why that abuse will be more egregious in the Pro world than in the Con world. Finally, there are severe wait times in the U.S. too: ""The uninsured are 3-4 times more likely than those with insurance to report problems getting needed medical care, even for serious conditions. In one study, more than half of the uninsured postponed needed medical care due to financial concerns, while over one third went without a physician-recommended medical test or treatment due to financial concerns."" (Kao-ping and Casoy) (D) I explained how neither Obamacare nor lower drug prices solved. In which case, there""s not solvency on the Con side either, and if the burden is shared, she should have some level of solvency. I didn""t explain why people should have to pay for others because that is not necessarily going to happen on the Pro side. I don""t have to defend a specific form of UHC, and thus, I don""t have to offer a means of funding it either, as each system is funded differently. MY CASE Ultimately, my opponent never rebuts that actual evidence I provide as to the added costs of uninsurance. She just offers some competing statistics that fail to address the specific point I raised. Thus, those points can be extended across the flow. Furthermore, the source she cites is largely specific to Sweden, and what goes on in one nation is not necessarily characteristic of what goes on in most. And, while the U.S. may have some high survival rates among those who are treated, the evidence I provided shows how many are untreated or seek treatment to late due to a lack of insurance. She says that the failures of Obamacare are unverifiable, yet, the CBO is a highly reliable source that is non-partisan and has a huge amount of information to draw on. It seems far more reliable, therefore, than pro-conservative LocunTenens.com. If most doctors, as you can see if you pull the actual survey report from their social media pages, southern doctors were polled slightly more. That demographic is likely to skew the results = methodological flaw. Furthermore, Con literally provides no warrant at all as to why most people would choose to be uninsured under Obamacare. Con drops my points about the need to eliminate the emotional suffering of the uninsured. Con drops the additional information I offered to support the Thorpe study. Con also never addressed the Murray evidence. Con drops my turn of her Cato evidence, showing how it could bolster the pro position. REASONS TO VOTE PRO (1) Con drops my analysis of Germany""s healthcare system (round two), in which reforms were made to stabilize it. The wait times there are small, and it""s economically viable. This illustrates that UHC doesn""t necessarily have to entail the economic harms she forecasts. Germany represents the possibility of success. (2) Con""s economic analysis, particular that of the ill-defined risk of a credit downgrade that she cannot link directly with a warrant to UHC, fails to show undue risk of economic harm through UHC. Furthermore, many of her arguments only rely on a few examples. Just because 3 or 4 nations have some issues, that does not mean that UHC, which is practiced in dozens of nations, is bad. (2) UHC is economically beneficial. The dropped Thorpe and Murray analysis shows, clearly and with solid methodology, how UHC could save up to 1.1 trillion dollars, and would contribute to lower absenteeism, etc. (3) Con cannot solve. Obamacare would only reduce uninsurance rates by a measly 40%. Even with lowered drug costs, this is not enough (as my earlier analysis shows.) (4) I do solve""though I don""t need to. By virtually eliminating uninsurance and its incumbent harms (bankruptcy, emotional distress, communicable disease, 25% greater likelihood of mortality, etc.), I do solve for the problem posed within the resolution. Con, thank you for an amazing, polite, and high-quality debate!"	PRO	29
S2d55d1c3-A941be1df	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"Contrary to pro's assertion, nations with universal healthcare are not nearly as wealthy as the US whose free market system has made it possible. The 2nd wealthiest nation is the PRC whose GDP is only half of the US. Also, average amounts/person are inaccurate because they don't include individual data that accounts for the actual amount spent by each individual (http://epianalysis.wordpress.com...). The US ranks 30 on life expectancy because nations with socialized healthcare have other “progressive” policies such as working limits. People in the EU are limited to 48 hours/week (http://en.wikipedia.org...) meaning that the time spent in stressful work settings is smaller in the EU and stress is a common cause of coronaries (http://www.mindbodygreen.com...) and the US has a higher occurrence of coronary deaths than any of pro's examples (same as pro's source). The US is also good at preventive care in terms of cancer and senior vaccinations (http://www.urban.org...). Its treatment of diabetes is superior to Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and its cancer treatment is superior to 17 other European nations. On access, even someone who makes minimum wage can afford a visit to the doctor ($180) and one prescription ($161) (http://www.dailyfinance.com...) a year if they are sanitary and frugal. In the long run they may save the excess money to invest, increasing income further. Savings, investments, and wages also grow more quickly when free markets are allowed to work unimpeded (cross apply to living wage argument). Also, if the government controls healthcare, the industry ceases to answer to the market and doesn't have to improve and can even use its power to choose who is served and who isn't based on anything. While this doesn't happen the instant a service is socialized, it should not be risked. On insurance, the reason that companies don’t pay for preexisting conditions, cap the care, and raise rates for those with health risks is that otherwise, the business would pay more money than it brought in and fail. Meaning that payment would have to be out of pocket again which is usually more difficult and costly than using insurance. Income growth, competition, and an incentive to provide low cost education to more of the market will make private education more affordable. Pro has also forgotten that the reason that private schools in the US are high rate is that public schools (everyone pays) have driven the low cost private schools (users pay) off the market while the actual economic cost of public education is enormous (round 1). When looking at public education in other nations and its effect on the economy, we have to analyze the GDP of these nations and their landmasses (https://www.cia.gov...). When comparing the three largest examples pro gave, we find that, put together, Australia and Canada have almost twice the land of the US but only 1/5 of its GDP, showing that public education systems may not serve economies well. Also quality access would be available to most if public education ended allowing cheaper schools back onto the market and giving the current expensive private schools competition. Hoarding wealth isn't theft. Everyone owns wealth if they choose to hoard it, that’s their business, they cease to act in the market and do not benefit from it. This leaves everyone else to exchange their wealth for a different kind of wealth and to generate more. Thus, wealth doesn't move bottom up, or even necessarily up down, it grows in free markets. The oligopolies to which pro refers were likely the cronies of government during the 1800s (http://mises.org...). Business is not as powerful as pro says, it must always answer to the market. If the market doesn’t like the product, the market won't buy it. This is why an oligopoly can't kill competition. If a new competitor appears that has better products, the market will shift to the competitor. I agree that in order to participate in government, people should be informed but if the government is the doing the informing, this power could be as easily abused as power over socialized healthcare. Examples of governments abusing their power over children include the HJ (http://en.wikipedia.org...) and various communist nations where public education was used for brainwashing. Ending welfare creates an incentive to find productive work but the incentive to work is reduced when you are provided with government assistance. With regards to layoffs, fewer people would be laid off if the government didn’t hinder business with heavy taxes, regulations, and monetary stimulus which causes recessions (http://mises.org...) according to Misesian Theory. Also, there is no evidence or logic that says a sense of security helps find jobs. Also, almost anyone has the means to work if they have a big enough incentive to. Pro’s argument on payment & access doesn't constitute evidence or logic, it's just an attempt to appeal to emotion and should not be considered over logic and examples. Yes working conditions were bad by today’s standards but again only because this was the birth of industrial capitalism. Also, the reason that children worked was because otherwise they and their families would have starved or returned to their lives as subsistence farmers with much lower standards of living. Yes the machinery was dangerous and the factories crowded, but that’s what hazard pay is for and again, from 1865 to 1900, income grew by 2.14%/year whereas in the last century it has grown by only 0.85%/year (http://usinfo.org...). This same argument applies to developing nations. Pro affirms that progressivism didn't create wealth or jobs. Also you can’t have a good economy but harm the public overall because the economy is the public. The economy is composed of every individual and business that operates. You harm the economy, you harm the public and vice versa. Pro has stepped back on his statement that the property rights system works (round 3). The reason that some people didn’t sue for damage is partly because of initially slow wealth generation. Another reason is that much land was still publicly owned, it wasn’t until 1862 that the government began to privatize this (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Even then only 10% of it was sold and was distributed throughout not just around factories. Further, environmental damage can't necessarily be prevented by government regulation, the waterways in the US are an example. These aren't privately owned but publicly owned and regulated (http://mises.org...). The government in this instance is one of the biggest polluters because of the publicly run sewage system, there already exist viable and nonpolluting chemical toilets but why buy one when you'll still have to pay for everyone else to pump it into the river. The social market doesn't work well. Correlation is not causation. Scandinavia may seem rich but what does it happen to be sitting on top of? North Sea oil. Similarly, because Saudi Arabia is a rich monarchy doesn't mean that monarchies are the best governments. Also, if we do another analysis regarding land and GDP, with pro's examples here, the combined landmass is still about twice that of the US and yet their total GDP is 3/5 of the US. If one were to graph the Heritage data, you would see that the overall rating for the US fell after the implementation of anti-free market policies which I openly oppose in this debate. Pro again ignores the effect of time on governments with too much power. ""Trusts"" remains unanswered. Sumarry next round."	CON	30
S2d55d1c3-A2a18ea5b	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	The assertion that the PRC had 1/2 the nominal GDP is correct. Pro wishes to use a different measuring scale which is perfectly acceptable but the fact still remains that this is the next wealthiest nation and provides a scale of where other nations with universal healthcare are in terms of wealth and why average healthcare spending per person might be different among these nations. While it may be true that the US ranks lower in terms of GDP per capita than some nations with universal healthcare, these nations rank lower in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita than nations with even freer markets such as Luxembourg (http://en.wikipedia.org...), Singapore (http://en.wikipedia.org...), and Hong Kong (http://en.wikipedia.org...) and Luxembourg tops all of pro’s examples here in the nominal GDP per capita. My statement about progressive work policies can’t be used as support for regulations because while life expectancy may increase in the short run, in the long run it slows productivity which can result in economic failure and then much shorter life expectancy. On spending, some people just choose to pay more to use more of different kinds of services. This is the individual data that cannot be seen or assessed by using spending to GDP ratios or average spending per person. The government should not have control over healthcare because as I said last round, it could abuse its power and choose who lives and dies based simply on politics. The logic on the 1/5 the GDP is that if public education was better at fueling an economy than private education, then the GDP should be higher than that of the US which uses large numbers of private institutions for education rather than the mostly government run system of Canada (http://en.wikipedia.org...) and the highly regulated and subsidized system of Australia(http://en.wikipedia.org...). Also, while in the US we may have freedom of information, this is not guaranteed to last forever particularly if the government controls education. We are not talking about a short term impact but a long term one and to sacrifice our descendants’ freedom for a wasteful public education system is not only impractical but also against the goals of the constitution and the very reason for founding the US (see preamble). Also, if public schooling is eliminated then lower cost private schools would reenter the market, give the current high rate private schools competition, and thus provide quality, cost effective education to most, if not all, who want it. While it may seem that we should force people who simply want to keep their wealth to sacrifice it, this is both immoral and impractical. It is immoral in that you are essentially stealing from someone who has earned their wealth to give to someone who hasn’t and impractical because it drains the private sector’s wealth which could have been otherwise allocated later to grow the economy and employ the needy. It is better to teach a man to fish than to simply give him one, especially if that fish is stolen. While large scale business may attempt to use their wealth to lobby for special benefits, the solution to this is not more government, but less. If the power of government is reduced alongside taxes, there will be less of an incentive to lobby for tax breaks, subsidies and special regulations. As I pointed out last round, there would be fewer economic stagnations and they would be less severe if the government did not heavily regulate, tax, and use monetary stimulus. In these conditions, welfare is unnecessary and currently is a burden that must be removed if the economy is to prosper which leads to higher employment and standards of living. It is correct that you are only served if you pay and this is the most fair way of rationing because it rewards people based on what they’ve done, not on need. It is also the most practical because if we rewarded based on need, then the needy would likely just keep getting needier and as Thatcher said, “The problem with socialism is sooner or later you run out of other people’s money.” To further answer pro’s argument on Scandinavia, oil is not the only cause of their wealth. Another cause, particularly for Sweden, is it had free markets between 1870 and 1950. Then, Sweden implemented an ever growing welfare state which caused economic stagnation. The effect of the welfare state has been alleviated by a slight return to free markets which has marginally improved the economy since 1980.(http://mises.org...) Regulations in general actually do deny economic freedom and this is not debunked but rather supported by Heritage. Heritage shows that the US regulatory state has become more powerful and has dragged down economic freedom as shown by these tables (http://www.heritage.org...). There is no problem with a business having to compensate for property damages after settling in court. The existence of property rights will serve as enough of a deterrent to not damage property through pollution that only a few suits would be necessary to set an example. One universal law is not more efficient. Pollution by government is affirmed. Businesses would not necessarily do the same if the waterways were privately owned. The government doesn't need to promote chemical toilets because if businesses have to compensate for polluting waterways they will have an incentive to find more efficient disposal or raise rates thus either causing a shift to chemical toilets or a shift to a less pollution by the sewage provider. The reason that absent regulation conditions would have improved is the incentive to keep your workforce alive and undamaged. If you have no workforce, you can't produce and if you can't produce, you can't sell or profit. That is the incentive to improve safety. No it is not ideal that children had to work to keep from starving but at the time the only three options were work, starve, or live as a subsistence farmer for the rest of your life, even public school, as pro pointed out, was not a viable option because they either had to work in factories, or on a farm. Mechanization, although progressing rapidly, was not nearly as far along as it is today and if you look to developing nations, you find that they are mechanizing much more quickly than the US did during the industrial revolution because the technology to do so already exists. In the PRC as well, working conditions are actually high when compared to the industrial revolution in the US. Also, the wealth does not simply remain at the top, large amounts of it are making it to a growing middle class (http://www.youtube.com...) as evidenced by the documentary the “People’s Republic of Capitalism.” It is correct that trusts would be nothing to worry about because they would still have to worry about potential competition. There would remain an incentive to keep operations efficient and improve products to avoid the possibility of new competitor replacing them. Also, with an unregulated market and a government whose sole purpose is to protect rights, the trust would not be able to simply squash competition by abusing its power otherwise it would infringe upon the rights of others and the government shield would step in for protection. Antitrust legislation diminishes competition as I previously said. If a business knows that its competitor is simply going to get cut down by legislation, then there is less reason to continue to compete. It is also a disincentive for the competitor that knows that its achievement is capped, reducing the incentive to achieve.	CON	31
S2d55d1c3-Ab1903089	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	First, to correct my opponent on his understanding of my essential services argument, I stated that “essential government services would be those of the police (domestic protection), courts (justice), and military (protection from foreign invasion).” Not that these were the only services that would be necessary for a long and happy life. Also, I agree that currently in the U.S. the really poor (meaning no income) are not able to afford extensive healthcare, this problem can only be solved with wealth generation and private employment growth only possible through capitalism. I would now like to point out that my opponent has neglected to answer my argument that competition in the healthcare sector drives service quality up, and prices down in order to win the patronage of the market so that the business may profit. Pro also ignores the fact that rather than U.S. citizens going to countries with socialized healthcare for their healthcare needs, it is the other way around. Also, I agree that people should have a basic understanding of the world and while very few people did have access to education prior to public schooling, we have to remember that at the time, public schools had lower attendance rates than the “backward” private ones in places like Indiana and Illinois (http://mises.org...). Also, this lack of availability my opponent mentioned was likely due to the low population density at the time as displayed by this map (http://etc.usf.edu...). Finally, my argument that private industry can provide education at lower overall economic cost still stands as this argument from round one has remained un-countered. The cost of public education is still unreasonably expensive for all those who pay taxes and private industry can still provide better, cheaper education because of competition and profit incentive. While only partial socialization of food/housing is certainly better than total socialization it is still bad because you still create a drain on the economy by taxing the productive people in society to pay to support those who produce little to nothing. My argument that private industry does a better job of production and distribution of food and housing from round 1 has also not been contended and so still stands. Yes, one business could conceivably control the entire network of transportation but this isn’t realistic, because as I explained towards the end of my argument on the third premise, the market changes too quickly for monopolies to form easily thanks to competition, and wealth generation which results in higher pay and better products and increased investment which leads to innovations which in turn breeds more competition. Look to my argument on the third premise from round 1 for more information. Also, the government will not always necessarily answer to the public as my opponent contends. This is because as you give it more power over your life and the lives of others its purpose changes from the purpose of serving the people by protecting their rights, to ruling the people. Absolute power, corrupts absolutely. There are more examples of powerful governments ruling their people rather than serving them (DPRK, USSR, Nazi Germany, the Philippines under Marcos, PRC, Iraq, etc.). My opponent’s basic argument for his first premise is that only the needy should get government help and not those who can pay for it. The problems with this is the creation of a disincentive to work. The logic here is simple, “If you don’t have to work to eat, get healthcare, transportation, education and housing, while I have to work in order to have those things for myself and you, why should I work? Why not let someone else pay for both of us?” Thus, the welfare state spirals out of control where more and more people become dependent on the socialized “essential services” for living. The result is a country like Greece or Portugal where people are protesting having to pay the now outrageous bill for their socialized industries. The second premise is affirmed in that the industries mentioned should be part of the free market. In my opponent’s attack on my third premise arguments, he is essentially implying that all the businesses are going to underpay their employees when possible. However if this were historically proven, then Microsoft and Apple would be paying their employees at precisely the regulated minimum wage. Instead computer programmers earned $72,630 each in 2011 (http://money.usnews.com...). Why is this? Part of it is competition as I mentioned in my rebuttal, the other part is the fact that businesses pay employees by how much the business values them. It is very similar to renting an apartment, you pay what it is valued overall by the market except in the case of employees, they are renting their services to employers who make up the market that purchases labor and they purchase it at what it is valued by the market. My opponent also brings up the 1800s as an example of employee defrauding, however the reason that wages were so low was because this was essentially the birth of industrial capitalism and so wealth generation initially of course was slow. However, despite the slow initial wealth growth non-farm income between 1865 and 1900 actually grew by 75% contrary to what my opponent would have you believe (http://en.wikipedia.org...(1865%E2%80%931918)). As to environmental regulation. Yes the property rights system works, the only reason that people pushed for regulation was the same reason that people pushed for other regulation of free markets. Impatience for social change and the contrast between the improved and the yet to catch up (http://mises.org..., and The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek). Also, when private property rights are not respected but are part of a vast government regulation system for purposes including the environment or socialization of industry, you get something like Zimbabwe (http://www.cgdev.org..., http://www.cgdev.org...). And the reason for the lawsuits is that then you get a case by case analysis of property damage and not simply an overarching regulation and an unelected board that has the authority to stop you from building a home on a piece of land that is owned by you simply because they think it’s a wetland (http://online.wsj.com...). Environmental regulation of the sort my opponent proposes only opens the way to bureaucracy and oppressive government. Finally, as to antitrust, the reason that antitrust laws were passed was a misunderstanding of the market by the majority who also happened to be the impatient and slow to catch up ones mentioned earlier in this rebuttal. Despite what my opponent would like you to think, antitrust is not good because of the fact that it reduces the incentive for businesses to compete by ensuring that the government will protect them from being out competed by a more efficient business in the same industry (http://mises.org...). Further, just because a group of people think that businesses have too much power and that antitrust legislation doesn’t make it so. That people voted for antitrust was my opponent’s only answer to my explanation of the rarity, short life, and relative harmlessness of natural monopolies in a completely free market system thus my argument still stands. I would also like to point out that my opponent made a similar answer to my explanation of the environment and property rights.	CON	32

S22d02825-A848a22b9	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	In March 2010, Barack Obama passed Health Care Reform Legislation. This legislation has generated substantial controversy. I argue that Health Care Reform should be repealed in its entirety. The Bill represents a massive expansion of government into a sector that has already been severely distorted by government policies. It includes hundreds of new regulations, massive tax increases, and a huge increase in debt. On top of all that, this bill will lead to rationing and wait times like they have in other Universal Health Care Systems abroad in countries like Canada and in American states like Massachusetts. The Canadian system has to deal with chronic waiting times and weak quality. In Massachusetts, where a form of Universal Health Care was implemented, people have to wait almost twice as long for care as they do in other states while prices have had massive increases. Massachusetts now has the most expensive Health Care System in the Country. The 2010 Health Care Legislation included a massive expansion of Medicaid, a program that is very unsuccessful. Numerous studies find that Medicaid has a negligible effect on its recipient's health. This is largely due to the fact that Medicaid patients have to wait long periods of time for care, because most doctors don't take Medicaid Patients due to low reimbursements and innefficiency. It also includes an employer mandate, which will simply worsen the problem our Health Care System already has: People don't pay for their own Health Care. We need to move towards a more consumer driven system for Health Care that will drive down costs and improve quality. This has happened with Lasik Surgery and Cosmetic Surgery where prices have fallen and quality has improved. Both of these services are not covered by insurance, meaning patients pay for their own Health Care. This gives consumers an incentive to shop for lower prices and more quality. This debate is not just about the 2010 Health Care Reform. This is also about Single Payer Health Care Systems, and whether or not they have succeeded (I argue that Single Payer is a failure). Advocates of Single Payer or Socialized Medicine are welcome to this debate as well, even if they oppose the 2010 Health Care Reform. This debate is about broader Health Care Policy. I personally advocate moving towards a more consumer driven system, that will be included in this debate as well.	PRO	34
Sda116120-Ad5894737	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	"Thank you YYW for your prompt response last round. I'm going to attempt to quote portions of my opponent's arguments which are representative I larger portions of his argument. I'll elaborate on the quote when necessary. Impact to Individuals ""It would go equally to those with zero income and those who buy nothing in the course of a month, as well as to billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates."" By implication, the ""prebate"" proposed to correct for FT's inherent regressiveness amounts to the creation of a ""national welfare program"" "" It's funny that Warren Buffett is brought up here. Warren Buffett is commonly quoted as saying it's unfair his secretary pays a higher tax rate than him. This plan would actually fix those loopholes Buffett uses to avoid paying as much as his secretary. The prebate wouldn't amount to a national welfare. One of the reasons for the rebate ( besides providing a progressive tax element) is to insure nobody pays taxes on basic necessities. It doesn't matter if it's Bill Gates or a family living below the poverty level. Nobody should have to pay the government for the most basic stuff they need to survive. The prebate just happens to be the fairest and most economical way to insure nobody has to pay to live. Right now a family living at the poverty level pays 22 cents on every dollar they spend on imbedded taxes. This isn't even taking into account FICA social security etc. coming out of their payroll check. Under the FT plan, they would pay Zero percent. I repeat. Exempting people from paying taxes on basic necessities isn't welfare. It's just good policy. ""there is essentially no relationship between the rebate and the cost of living"" Actually there is. The prebate is based off of what somebody spends at poverty level. Poverty level spending is a cost of living index. The prebate does more than the current tax system to make sure families don't get taxed on basic necessities. The 22 percent imbedded tax is no longer there for poverty level spending. ""Even still, FT's revenue neutrality rests on the erroneous assumption that ""no matter how large a family's income, 100% of it is consumed every year,"" which is not the case. In reality, the percentage of a person's income being consumed by expenses falls as income rates rise."" The FT revenue neutrality uses no such assumption. The plan exempts used goods from being taxed. Which is a key indicator that it isn't assuming 100% of income is taxed. Not to mention 100% of income not being used for tax exempt things, such as used cars, used houses, thrift shop purchases etc.. One of the attributes of the plan often promoted by FT proponents, is the fact that savings and investments will be untaxed. These are things not included in the calculations used to determine if it was revenue neutral. Even if we forget about what I just stated, money earned is typically spent at some point. If the millionaire doesn't spend his money then his unappreciative children or grandchildren will blow his money after he dies. Hell Paris Hilton isn't even waiting for her dad to die to blow his money. ""By implication, were FT was implemented, however, retirees who supplement their income with savings accumulated during a time when personal income was taxed would in effect be subject to double taxation"" This is only during the adjustment phase, and remember the prices already include an imbedded tax, so they are double taxed anyway. If you take away that 22% imbedded tax, add in the 23% fair tax and take into consideration the prebate than retirees are actually coming out ahead. Let's not forget retirees actually are triple taxed in the current system anyway. They get the tax on investments, typically taken out immediately or upon withdrawing. They also are responsible for corporate taxes because they're share holders, plus they pay that imbedded tax. I'll take double taxation over triple taxation any day. ""the FT's implementation would disproportionally harm young workers in the process of establishing their livelihoods as they purchase first cars, homes and pay for childcare."" Most young workers just starting out would buy used homes and cars. These are things exempt from the fair tax. As far as child care is concerned, the imbedded taxes would be removed from that and a lot of subsidies already in place to help families afford child care would remain in place. There would be minimal to no impact on these individuals. ""an enormous shift in the tax burden from the wealthy to those with lower and middle incomes."" Nope, even if Uncle Sam isn't taxing your paycheck, you still pay that 22% imbedded tax and with the prebate that would kill any taxes you paid on products up to the poverty level. So in reality poor people would pay zero taxes as opposed to the 22% imbedded tax and the payroll tax. Faulty Economic Logic "". The reality is that you can't have both gains in post-tax income and depreciating prices once embedded taxes are vacated,"" That's just a misunderstanding of what FT proponents are saying. Once the FT is implemented prices would immediately increase by the 30%. Obviously companies will try not to reduce prices once the tax is implemented, so they can easily keep their profit margin. However once their competitors start making market share grabs, the price will settle back to what it originally was before the FT was implemented. Incomes should remain the same. However the prebate when factored in would mean that less of your money will go to pay taxes. The FT is dangerous ""what is there to prevent a [federal] income tax from being from being imposed after a national sales tax has been enacted?"" Nothing! There is actually systems in place to insure this doesn't happen here is a quote from the following website.http://www.fairtax.org... ""No current supporter of the FairTax would support the FairTax unless the entire income tax is repealed. Moreover, concurrent with the repeal of the income tax, a constitutional amendment repealing the 16th Amendment and prohibiting an income tax will be pushed through Congress for ratification by the states (filed as HJR 16 in the 110th Congress)."" So this the FT has a companion bill that always goes to vote with it. If a fairtax got implemented, we wouldn't end up with some 2 headed snake. ""Similarly, due to the increased transactional costs the FT would impose on state and local government, it is entirely foreseeable that the FT would actually necessitate states increasing their income tax rates just to achieve revenue neutrality. "" This isn't true either. The fairtax actually doesn't require states to collect it on the federal governments behalf. If states do collect it they will be paid a portion of the taxes collected to make up for the cost of collecting it. http://www.fairtax.org... I actually did this argument at the last minute. I hope this rushed first draft is easy to read and comprehend."	PRO	35
Sdd22a6ba-A720c9967	Gay marriage should be illegal	"Rebuttals: From Con's own argument: "" But what decides those limits? John Stuart Mill found a solution: he argued that a person could do anything as long as it doesn't cause harm to non-consensual others. He distinguished between ""other-regarding acts"" and ""self-regarding acts,"" the former being an act that affected non-consensual others and the latter being one that was a decision of oneself. "" From my argument: ""Massachusetts public schools began teaching grade-school students about same-sex marriage, defending their decision because they are “committed to teaching about the world they live in, and in Massachusetts same-sex marriage is legal.” A Massachusetts appellate court ruled that parents have no right to exempt their children from these classes."" If anything, Con is strengthening my point made in the last argument. The government legalizing gay marriage and forcing people to go along with it and betray their morals is ridiculous. This hurts ""non-consensual others"" who did not want gay marriage to be legalized. If this is Con's principals, I have already won this debate. Con tries to assert that gay marriage would minimize pain and maximize happiness. However, he neglets that my economic case does indeed apply to hapiness. We all know that if the government is in debt, moral in the country will be low. The more in debt the country, the less happy the people. Therefore, lowering our debt would make the people of a country happy. I would like to assert that the purpose of government isn't always to make the people happy. The purpose of government is to make the country good. The purpose of government is to take action to ensure that the country will be around to see another day. My first argument is the only argument based on cost-benefit analysis. I would like to assert that cost is an important factor in determining whether or not action should take place. This standard could apply to common decisions in everyday life. For instance, no matter how happy it would make me to have an anime box set of Black Bullet along with a Rentaro figure, I simply don't have the money to make my dream a reality. Thus, cost plays a role in determining whether or not I should get something that would make me happy. While my opponent is focusing on making everyone happy, which is impossible, I am focused on the benefit of the country as a whole. No matter what my opponent does, nothing he does will make every single person happy. Gay marriage being legal makes me unhappy. Therefore, Con's measures to appease the people of a country are only beneficial to one side; while it neglects the other. Therefore, Con is making one side happy; while he's making the othesr side unhappy. If happiness is what he stands for, he is commiting a logical fallacy. From Con's argument: ""I argue that gay marriage doesn't harm anyone"" Thus, he acknowledges that gay marriage does in fact harm some people. Therefore, he entire stance on making the country happier is a lost cause. There is no exact way to find the measure of happiness in such a broad area such as a country. Therefore, Con's arguments are shaky. ""So I'm using this argument as a sort of resolutional analysis: if Pro doesn't convincingly show that gay marriage causes harm, presume Con because of the harm principle. "" Con admits that Gay Marriage causes harm in his earlier quote. Therefore, I have won the debate. Rebuttals to Discrimination. There are three definitions to the word, ""discrimination"". "": the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people : the ability to recognize the difference between things that are of good quality and those that are not : the ability to understand that one thing is different from another thing"" (1) ""OurR33;currentR33;abhorrenceR33;ofR33;discrimination,R33;whichR33;inR33;manyR33;areasR33;isR33;validR33; andR33;perfectlyR33;justified,R33;reliesR33;onR33;twoR33;featuresR33;ofR33;behaviour:R33;first,R33;thatR33;someoneR33;isR33; treatedR33;differentlyR33;toR33;someoneR33;else;R33;butR33;secondly,R33;thatR33;thisR33;differentR33;treatmentR33;isR33; providedR33;forR33;anR33;irrelevantR33;reason. 2.R33;HenceR33;isR33;notR33;enoughR33;toR33;claimR33;thatR33;thereR33;isR33;discrimination,R33;simplyR33;toR33;pointR33; toR33;differentialR33;treatment.R33;OneR33;mustR33;alsoR33;beR33;ableR33;toR33;argueR33;thatR33;theR33;reasonR33;forR33;thisR33; treatmentR33; isR33; notR33; aR33; goodR33; reasonR08;R33; thatR33; itR33; isR33; irrelevant.R33; IfR33; IR33; denyR33; someoneR33; aR33; jobR33; becauseR33;ofR33;theirR33;race,R33;inR33;almostR33;everyR33;conceivableR33;circumstancesR33;thatR33;willR33;beR33;anR33; irrelevantR33;reason,R33;becauseR33;theirR33;raceR33;willR33;notR33;impactR33;onR33;theirR33;abilityR33;toR33;doR33;theR33;job.R33; (ThereR33; areR33; ofR33; courseR33; someR33; limitedR33; circumstancesR33; whereR33; thisR33; isR33; notR33; trueR08; employmentR33;ofR33;anR33;actorR33;toR33;playR33;someoneR33;inR33;aR33;film,R33;provisionR33;ofR33;supportR33;servicesR33; toR33; peopleR33; whoR33; willR33; beR33; suspiciousR33; ofR33; thoseR33; fromR33; aR33;majorityR33; racialR33; group,R33; etc.R33; InR33; thoseR33;casesR33;thereR33;willR33;beR33;differentialR33;treatment,R33;butR33;sinceR33;itR33;hasR33;aR33;goodR33;reason,R33;itR33; isR33;notR33;“discrimination”.)"" (2) I will get back to this later in my rebuttals. I would like to ask how heteronormativity help reenforce gender roles; and how that's bad. Homosexual love is not equal. I have addressed that with my cheating statistics and more which Con has simply marked off as irrelevant and not important. However, it proves that homosexual love is not equal to heterosexual love. Economic Rebuttal: ""I estimate that same-sex marriage legalization would increase federal income tax revenues somewhere between $20 million and $40 million. "" From Source 5 of Con's argument. I would like to disqualify this man as an expert. He does not have a basic understanding of taxation and economics. I will provide numbers now. ""The Atlantic authors claim that due to laws favoring married couples, a single peson earning $40,000 a year pays $6,181 in taxes on that income, while a married individual with the same income pays only $5,162—a savings of more than $1,000 annually."" (3) ""Using averages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a single person in his 20s spends about $9,964 on housing where a married couple the same age averages $8,844. Over 60 years this can add up to over $67,200 in savings for a married couple."" (3) ""The same pattern emerges for expenditures on healthcare. Singles spend about $570 per year on healthcare while couples average about $963, which is only $482 per person—far less than their single peers, because of the reduced costs of coverage."" (3) These studies clearly show the amount of potential money the government could earn by keeping homosexuals unmarried. The economist in his source does not understand basic taxation of married couples as I have shown here. Therefore, I urge voters to disqualify his work. The rest of his sources only address the imediate money that will come for it. My arguments states the longterm cost it will have. With these numbers, including the numbers I gave with the other taxes which Con says I didn't, you can clearly see how all the money the government gets will eventually be used up by the cost which will then lead the country into more debt. Rebuttal to Right: Con makes the assumption that if it exists, it must apply to anyone. The logic is not good. With that logic, certain benefits given to people who are not criminals should be given to people who are criminals. He is addressing that sexuality is a choice. I will cover this later. Rebuttal to Morality: A). It is clear that I do unless Con did not read my arguments. B). It is interesting you say that, I have studies that say the opposite. (4) (5) and fallacies of pro-gay studies. (6) C). Weren't you saying hapiness of the people mattered? If they don't want to bake a cake, why should they have to? What religion doesn't allow their followers to deny a race a cake and what law forces them to make that cake? Also, why is said law bad? Under your argument, this would make the person unhappy, which isn't good. D). When you assert homosexual love is the same as heterosexual love and there is no basis for discrimination, that is pretty important. You even ignore the quote I gave explaining how it isn't a point of being equal anymore. Discrimination of Homosexuality and Choices: I am running out of characters so I'll try to keep it short. Homosexuality is a choice. (7) (8) (9) Thus, people are held accountable for their actions. If one chooses to be homosexual, they will face discrimination. As I mentioned earlier, discrimination can also mean the ability to recognize the difference between things that are of good quality and those that are not. I have proven through my arguments that being homosexual is inferior to being heterosexual through the infidelity statistics, statistics of sexual activity and STDs (should be in my sources. If it isn't let me know and I'll get it for you.), and my statistics on gay parenting. My other sources prove homosexuality is a choice. Thus, people shame bad choices. You assume that higher mental disorders are because homosexuality is not accepted by some people. Some people do not accept homosexuality and rightfully so. If one needs validation from other people, it proves they are insecure about their positon. For instance, I've seen people who were bullied for liking anime. Did they stop watching anime or got insecure? Did they develop a mental condition? No. They simply carried on with their day and didn't care what they had to say. You also ignore bulling to heterosexuals for other reasons besides their sexuality; which is a problem of its own. You also blindly assume people are bullied just because they are homosexual. If someone would bully me for being heterosexual, I would laugh. This is because I believe heterosexuality is right. Anime OP: http://tinyurl.com... http://tinyurl.com... Character limit.

S22d02825-A674cbf6d	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"INTRO I welcome Pro to DDO and thank him for instigating this fine debate! As a tip for a new debater, I strongly advise him to use sources in his next round. Making claims without reliable sources do no stand up well. REBUTTAL a. ""It includes . . . a huge increase in debt."" I contend that this is false. The ""Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting both pieces of legislation [Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, Public Law 111-148); and, following that, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which together make ""the health care reform""] will produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $143 billion over the 2010-2019 period."" [1] b. ""On top of all that, this bill will lead to rationing and wait times like they have in other Universal Health Care Systems abroad in countries like Canada and in American states like Massachusetts."" Actually, the health care reform does not create a government run health care program such as in Canada [2]. And Massachusetts does not have government run healthcare either [3]. The program that has been in Massachusetts as well as the health care reform package only serve to help everyone become insured [2, 3]. Furthermore, a waiting-line crisis does not exist in Canada [4]. That is propaganda with no substantiation. Canada has a much higher patient satisfaction rate than America [5]. c. ""The 2010 Health Care Legislation included a massive expansion of Medicaid, a program that is very unsuccessful. Numerous studies find that Medicaid has a negligible effect on its recipient's health."" Incorrect. A study ""by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) reveals that Medicaid recipients have far greater access to doctors, live healthier lives and enjoy more financial stability than those who must go without.""

S5d12ad-A81da3201	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"Questions] 1. Thank you for the more reputable source. I did not mean to be attack the original source, but it was about as backed as any blog could be so I figured we needed a better one. (that being said, I fully accept this new source). 2.[A&B] I apologize, for I was not originally clear in my statement. -The prison system of the united states separates criminals based on the severity of their crimes.[1] This means the 10% of criminals who have longer sentences, will generally be sent to different prison than the white collar criminals. NOTE: I only mention this difference because equating the 90% and 10% together is not how the prison system works. C) This assumption is actually based on your premise, in that people through their sexual desire rape another person. I put the assumption that generally people will not rape another person because of lack of sex in that time. [Disagreements] 1 -Would like to note the realistic approach my opponent takes here, while in a few paragraphs states the argument is hypothetical. A). While I do believe that AIDS*(or any disease) is a heavy financial burden, it's not relevant in that regard as a ""death sentence"" for that is primarily a healthcare issue. [BCD] -ok. =============================== [Prostitution is Illegal] Oh boy... Ok I wasn't going to argue this part because I was assuming this was purely hypothetical in the case that prostitution was legal, in fact your next point is that we ""should"" do this, not if we ""could"". -A reoccurring theme. Prostitution is illegal and some prisoners are in jail for charges involving prostitution. What argument you have for the prevention of prison rape would not matter, it would be condoning an illegal activity to the people it put in prison for doing the same thing. Do you know how much distrust that would generate with the people? With the prisoners? It would make the assumption that the Government could do whatever it wanted regardless if it was illegal or not. Secondly, I don't know if you know this but the case of the Native American and African Americans is entirely different and they are based upon completely different cultures. Also, affirmative action was a thing. (But this is extremely off topic and I just was pointing out that it was a horrible example). ===================== [Cost and Realistic Approach] Should and could. The act of preventing AIDS/Rape, you ""should"" do whatever you can. But I think that there are better alternatives and that just because you should do something, does not mean you escape the reality of if you could* do something. For instance, we SHOULD give Americans the best healthcare possible for free and stop everyone from ever committing a crime again. But can we do that? No. 1. Spending A) It would benefit more people and people of better societal standing to spend that money in other areas. The homeless, the poor, generally the money could go anywhere else it would effect more people in a more meaningful way. B) The general public would never go for government sponsored prostitutes. C) The politicians would never back it either. D) Again, a tax for government sponsored prostitutes. Would never fly. Ever. You are mixing taxation(which people hate) and a societal taboo. 2. Society and politics A) The US being what it is, would never EVER let this happen. I mean you'd be making the jump from legal prostitution to prisoners getting prostitutes. A large portion of the US is against gay marriage, marijuana, and healthcare already .B)Whichever party puts this up will be giving the other side a ""win button"" for any debate, any ad, and in general. The implications that could have on American law-making would be horrible. [The Problem solved] 1. You know, this is problem I forgot to address. You are linking the lack of sex to rape. This is not a X=Y scenario, rape is also not generally caused by a lack of sex in normal scenarios and is a bit deeper than the X=Y fashion it has been addressed in. -But on that note, I think masturbation would solve the problem just as much with a thousandth of the cost. Sexual urges gone, I don't see the difference other than the argument that ""sex =/= masturbation"" which is irrelevant as it addresses the main problem. 2. Again, you seem to not use a realistic scenario and just think that prostitutes will like this system because they get beat less*(maybe) and now have a government sponsored pimp. A) You'd have to pay and provide food/lodging. B) Most prostitutes aren't that trusting of their government, seeing as how their work is illegal. C) Most people, everyone really, regards prison in a negative light. D) There would be abuse. As much as you'd like to argue against it, the crimes against sex workers is already very common. In prison, I am not convinced this would present less opportunities for abuse. Prison: It's not a place you want to go. It's not a place you want to visit. While I have no factual proof to back up that prostitutes would not like to work in a prison, I can surely tell you that they would not. =================================== [MORE FLAWS.] 1. If a prisoner has AIDS, he would not get a prostitute, and keep on raping. -If you could test and give him an AIDS infected prostitute, why not just have timed test for AIDS and separate the AIDS prisoners from everyone else? 2. The amount of prostitutes would be enormous for a decent ratio of non-STD infected ones to keep working. You'd need at least 1 for every 2-3 prisoners to not get a high infection rate. 3. The amount of pay you'd need to support a prostitute for getting infected with STD's and if she sued, would be ridiculous. 4. General cost of lodging, food, and pay for a prostitute would be more than a prisoner's cost. 5. What about those incarcerated for sexual assaults of any kind? It would be seen as a reward by society. 6. What about gay men or women? 7. What about those who deny the prostitutes? Would they be forced? =================================================== [Let me make the case for SHOULD NOT] -Real quick. 1. The government should not be hypocritical in it's implementation of the law. 2. Prostitutes would fair just as badly within a government system.*(especially one dealing with prison). 3. It would present too heavy of a financial burden on society, where funds could be spent elsewhere to impact more people. 4. It would impact the US political structure in a negative way. 5. Instead of solving both the issue of prostitution and prison rape completely, you'd be taking a very costly measure to try and stopgap a problem with no sufficient evidence it works. - It does not make prostitutes into productive members of society - It would introduce all kinds of new problems with handling the prostitutes. Again, should and could go hand in hand. If if the argument is not philosophical and has real world meaning/impact, then you should consider both accounts, not just the wishful thinking part. =================================== Proof I'm requesting: 1. That ""handlers"" would stop abuse of prostitutes or not abuse them. 2. The reason most inmates turn to rape is because of years without sex. -I figured to just bypass this because prostitution itself was an easier topic, but I'm done with that so I'll ask for this. -Also I wanted to make the point that rape is a deeper topic than ""lack of sex."" 3. This isn't ""proof"" but I'd like to see your estimate on cost done in scale with the system and your implementation of it."	CON	38
Sb841f71e-A7b712f7	Taxes Should Not Exist in the United States	""" (1) demand (as a verb) - to call for or require as just, proper, or necessary; to ask for with proper authority (both of these can be found here: http://dictionary.reference.com......) (2) impose (again, as a verb) - to lay on or set as something to be borne, endured, obeyed, fulfilled, paid, etc.; to put or set by or as if by authority (again, both of these can be found at http://dictionary.reference.com......) Seems to me, by these definitions, I can legitimately stand by my assertion that user fees are, in fact, a form of taxation, provided I clarify the following: user fees are nonetheless ""demanded"" from or ""imposed"" upon the individual; the only difference is that they're conditional."" ""Just, proper, or necessary,"" with ""Authority""-- none of these refers to a trade. ""Offer something in exchange"" is neither call for nor require. A trade is not ""laid on or set,"" ""put or set by or as if by authority."" ""Fire stuff... "" Not according to the definitions. "" To strengthen my argument, I wish to take note of the fact that if you consider the above example to not be a form of taxation, and you maintain that taxation cannot definitively be conditional, then logically you'd have to consider the income tax in this country (as it stands now) not to be a tax. After all, the government threatening you with a gun or jail time is still conditional. You can choose to either refuse (in which case, you get imprisonment, or, under more oppressive regimes, you get shot), or you can can choose to pay (in which case you receive the services the government provides, and you DON'T get imprisoned or shot)."" This is misinterpreting my argument. Those conditions are unequivocally an imposition, you were not going to get imprisoned or shot before they went and did those. Whereas, if the government offers you a service on a given condition-- you weren't going to get the service anyway before they made the offer, thus, they are not ""laying on"" anything to be endured etc. "" Furthermore, in order to remain consistent, someone in your position would have to consider sales tax on private industries NOT to be a form of taxation. After all, the tax is ""imposed"" on the citizen who purchases a product, but it's only within the context of his or her decision."" Again ignoring the point of my distinction. I am not abolishing the term taxation by nature of it's being conditional-- but by nature of what sort of condtion it is. Is it a ""condition"" in the sense that they offer you something you didn't have before in exchange for what you have? No imposition or demand is made then, your options from beforehand are intact, you can keep them that way OR change them. Are they making it so that no matter what they'll take something you had before, as they are with sales tax, income tax, or so forth (They'll take you're money, or take your life, but they won't leave you with the option you had before them of giving up neither.) That is a demand, an imposition. They are using their authority, not your choices, as the primary issue in the matter. "" I would also like you to be aware that common usage of a word does not necessarily mean that word is being used correctly, nor does it determine the definition of the word."" Words exist for no other purpose than to be used in expressing ideas, and have no objective meaning. The meanings arise from usage. Deviations from common usage may be justifiable, but they must be justified-- in the absence of a good reason, the common usage should prevail as the one most understood. ""Because the dictionary said so,"" is ad authoritatem, not a good reason. "" And last but not least, the definition of ""money."" Money, as I've stated, is a circulating MEDIUM of exchange. This means that something has to be placed between the exchange of two products. In other words, it does not and cannot include direct trading of two products."" "" an intervening agency, means, or instrument by which something is conveyed or accomplished: Words are a medium of expression. "" http://dictionary.reference.com... The agency or means of two people each placing a different ordinal preference on a pair of goods and therefore exchanging them is plenty fine as a medium. "" It states that Mesopotamia was the first to use ""money."" And Mesopotamia, of course, did have a government.

S5d12ad-A95c15745	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"I AGREE] 1. Rape does happen in prison and is a big concern when talking about the prison system.*(this also acknowledges the severity of the AIDS virus being spread through rape). 2. I have no such views that everyone in prison is a sick or demented person. I think this is more for the audience, but just re-iterate there is no debate on whether prisoners ""deserve what they get"", rape in prison is something that shall not be condoned in this debate and neither Pro nor Con will accept any such talk. 3. I agree on recidivism and the implications that a better system will have less repeat offenders. 4. I agree that in theory prostitution being supplied to prisoners would ""kill two birds with one stone"".* * But I do not hold the opinion that this is the correct answer, nor is it possible. [I QUESTION] 1. The legitimacy of the ""90% of prisoners are out in one year or less."" Especially coming from a non-linked quote at ABC news coming from an activist. 2. Accepting the quote as being true just to humor it: A) The statistic would not be in relation to the topic. B) There is no connection that those 90% would likely get raped by the 10%. C) We can generally assume that rape would not happen in under a year because of the lack of sex. 3. The legitimacy of [6] especially, but really all your sources are improperly linked. NOTE: You should just link federal or statistical data. Anything else is rather unneeded in this debate and I could have completely argued ""improper sources"" and have won that point quite easily. I however am not going to do that since my reply does not need to contradict them. [I DISAGREE] 1. The ""AIDS is a death sentence"" statement nor the linking of that to the current system. A) AIDS Is not curable, but it is no longer recognized as a ""Death Sentence"". B) The prison system does not give people the AIDS virus themselves. C) The prison system does not condone the act of rape. D) The prison system is not able to be held accountable of illegal activity, but should strive to prevent it. [Prostitution is ILLEGAL] This is where I could end the debate, but I am choosing not to. The fact that prostituting, pimping, or purchasing services gets you jail time and that it would be hypocritical for the government to sponsor the same thing that it sent people to jail for, kind of ends the argument. -But again, I'm humoring the debate and I think that Pro should have stated this being a ""hypothetical: If prostitution were legal"" scenario in the opening. [The COST and realistic approach of politics.] Right now the prison system cost taxpayers a lot to keep functioning. The added cost of prostitutes would be an enormous amount on top of that. one that would never get supported by the public and one that would probably never get into congress or such anyway because no politician would advocate for prostitution, much less for felons. [The Problem Solved] While I believe that the proposition would indeed solve both problems, there are better ways to go about doing this. 1. Give prisoners a better environment(more space/single person cells) and masturbation tools to relieve sexual frustration. 2. Make a better system so that prostitutes can become more helpful members of society and join the mainstream workforce. I'm going to make the point that the solution of giving prisoners prostitutes would not solve the issues of both problems entirely and that it would be a short-term answer to the problem. [The prostitutes themselves] 1. It is pretty apparent that people would still abuse the prostitutes, especially those in jail already for a long time or life. The prison guards themselves also pose a risk to the prostitutes. A) This would leave the people who are more likely to rape others(i.e. the 10%) not able obtain prostitutes. B) Less beatings or rapes of prostitutes does not mean it is the desired outcome. The desired outcome should be ZERO. C) Disregarding the people who went to jail for prostitution charges, it would present a big issue for sexual assaulter, rapist, and murderers to get these prostitutes as it would seem both rewarding and a danger to the prostitutes safety. 2. Willing prostitutes. How many prostitutes do you think would be actually willing to work at a prison? Not many. Prison presents both a higher mortality risk and a higher chance for infection. 3. The prostitutes would most likely go to the white-collar or less-threat prisoners, who are not usually the ones who would rape another prisoner. Therefore it wouldn't really solve the problem of rape in the prison system. ======================================================== I believe that is all I need for this response.

Sb841f71e-A7fb21593	Taxes Should Not Exist in the United States	""" Aside from the fact that taxes are necessary for our government to even exist (let alone function),"" This is not true. It is entirely possible to operate a government based upon user fees. ""As a universal rule, the term ""money"" refers to a circulating medium of exchange. When someone earns money, it is in their possession only until they decide to exchange it for something else. The fact that money can be used in this way is entirely because the government recognizes it as such; currency is sponsored by the government, and therefore, any given holder of any given amount of money does not OWN that money. The fact that the government lets them hold it is entirely in recognition of the fact that they are entitled to any product being sold for equal or lesser value."" The problem with this argument is that money existed prior to government, and taxes exist ontologically prior to any acceptance of paper money. The only reason we use paper money is because the government requires by law that taxes be paid in it. If someone produces something, and sells it for gold, with no help from the government, they will be required on penalty of prison to pay taxes in paper money, despite not possessing any paper money (They are therefore required to give up the things they created in ""exchange"" for paper money, which they then must give up.) It is thus irrelevant who owns the ""money"", because the ""money"" is not what is at issue-- the real values the individual owns by virtue of his having created them are being stolen. Adding the extra step of Federal Reserve Notes only serves to mask this fact, not eliminate it. If someone points a gun at me and demands the keys to my car, he is stealing from me. If he ""offers"" me a worthless piece of paper in exchange, this does not turn the theft into consent-- since I have no option to refuse the ""Trade."" It just introduces a confusing element. Indeed, even if I did consent to accept Federal Reserve Notes in exchange for my real property (which I would never do, nor would any sensible person, it is a worthless piece of paper and nothing more when you take the government's guns out of the equation), that would STILL not offer an excuse for then taking the money back from me. If a child trades his Charizard card for someone's Blastoise, and then threatens to stick the other child in a cage if he does not return the Charizard, no one will regard this as a fair trade, especially if the second child doesn't even get the Blastoise back."

S14e017ba-A8807dcd7	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Overutilization and Smart Cards Your source specifically said in the first paragraph that when co-pays were high, ""appropriate or needed"" medical care as well as ""inappropriate or unnecessary"" medical care were reduced."" A Smart Card, when used such as in Taiwan, hugely improves efficiency. Their administration costs are only about 2%. More Taiwanese are satisfied with their system than Americans as well, and they don't have waiting lists, like the USA won't need to have either. [1] --------------------Conclusion on Overutilization and Co-Pays Single-Payer would improve care, and also because with no insurance middle-man, the doctors and the patients deal with the problems without be denied coverage, high costs, or waiting for a referral. The evidence is no longer debatable; NATIONS WITH SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEMS HAVE BETTER CARE, COSTS, AND COVERAGE. With low co-pays that are based on income, and with a Smart Card, and because of our medical establishment, waiting lists would be minor or nonexistent. Overutilization would not be a problem because it would be swiftly dealt with. ""Private Care is better than Public"" With Medicare, patients show higher levels of satisfaction with their coverage and access to care COMPARED TO private insurance. They were more likely to rate their insurance as ""excellent"" and were less likely to report negative experiences with their plan. [2] Private health insurance has to pay for profits, and has to deny coverage to make up profits for the company. Millions are denied coverage. Plus, in our current system, 45,000 people a year die to a lack of insurance. This is the worse than a 9/11 attack a month. [8] Just because a hospital is required to let your use the emergency room doesn't mean that you will live. About Physicians and Technology Plus, 59% of physicians supported a Single-Payer healthcare plan. Single-Payer would increase the amount of physicians because of training, and because of stable wages at the same rate as now. Currently, they are declining. Health Planning Board [3] Full explanation on the Health Planning Board: A health planning board would be a public body with representatives of patients and medical experts. The representatives would decide on what treatments, medications and services should be covered, based on community needs and medical science, and allocate capital for major new investments based on assessments of where need is greatest. All medically necessary care would be funded through the single payer, including rehab, dental, etc. Drug Innovation Much medical research is ALREADY publicly funded under the N.I.H. In fact, usually the drug companies produce the marketing and advertising products, not the drug itself. [4] [3] Medical research doesn't disappear under universal health care system. Many famous discoveries have been made in countries with national health care systems. Laparoscopic gallbladder removal was pioneered in Canada. The CT scan was invented in England. The treatment for juvenile diabetes by transplanting pancreatic cells was developed in Canada. [4] Funding ----Businesses The 7% payroll tax would not be crippling. It also replaces all other employer expenses for employees’ health care, which would be eliminated. Plus, it would be a boon for business. In R2, I gave an example of Japan and the USA with auto manufacturers. In the USA, healthcare (private) adds $1500 to the price of a car. In Japan, it is just $500. So, Single-Payer healthcare would help businesses, and the whole economy. [5] --------Adjusting to New, Modern, World-Class (not 3rd world) Healthcare After the transition to public care, the unneeded workers could be protected while be retrained in new jobs. Total Costs People will seek care earlier when chronic diseases such as hypertension are more treatable. Both the uninsured and many of those with skimpy private coverage delay care because they are afraid of health care bills. This will be eliminated under such a system. All of these new costs to cover the uninsured and improve coverage for the insured will be fully offset by administrative savings, profits, and other costs now unneeded. [3] With appropriate investments in expensive, high-tech equipment and care, negotiating fees and budgets with doctors, hospitals, and drug companies, and setting a generous but finite budget on healthcare will be the best way to contain costs. We have the largest economy in the world. Nations that are smaller than us in economic ways still have better healthcare systems. This PROVES that the USA can do this. USA Healthcare ""Quality"" [6] Hospital Spending is 60% higher than other relatively expensive nations. Drug and medical goods here are also much more expensive, the same as administration costs (2.5 times higher there average). We also have high rates of avoidable hospital admissions for people with asthma, lung disease, diabetes, hypertension, and other common diseases. With life expectancy, we are 28th, right behind Chile. Total quality is at 37th, and our spending is 1#. This is a sign of massive failure. Medicare bureaucracy Plus Con, Paul Krugman, a famous economist and Nobel Prize winner, called the Single-Payer system, ""good economics"", and wrote, ""The great advantage of universal, government-provided health insurance is lower costs... Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance."" Krugman also has pointed out that the savings of single-payer would be ""far more than the cost of covering all those now uninsured."" [9] Private bureaucracy literally dwarfes the size of Single-Payer bureaucracy. [4] Conclusions: Time to Choose Unlike now, under a Single-Payer system, physician income would stabilize, and their number would increase. Single Payer is popular among physicians. Rationing, which already exists in the USA based on wealth, would be gone or very minor, as I said in R3. Overutilization wouldn't occur in a sleek, super efficient Smart Card system and fair co-pays. Administration costs would hugely plummet. Plus, many of my opponent's arguments are based on Socialized Medicine in the U.K., not always Single-Payer. Here is a quote from somebody in Canada on California's Single-Payer proposal: ""I live in Canada and we don't have a bunch of people here dying while waiting for healthcare. I don't know where you get this info??? No long wait times either... If you need to see a specialist you may have a wait (if not an emergency) regular doctors appts like checkups you book ahead of time. There is always a doctor on call at local clinics or hospital for any sudden illness or emergency."" [7] Care will be dealt between the doctor and patient in a private way, and the government would provide sleek, efficient coverage and payments. It is your choice: our fragmented system on life support, or a 21st century system of Single-Payer healthcare that is state-of-the-art. Sources: [1] http://www.npr.org...

S38f1c3c6-Abef0da21	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"I. Preface I want to clarify the definition of a resource. re·source a source of supply, support, or aid, especially one that can be readily drawn upon when needed. I have specifically provided this definition, due to what constitutes a resource was not stated by my opponent. Since it was not defined nor stated, we will assume that it is any resource, supply, support, or aid. In addition, it will obviously be assumed these resources can be extracted, therefore, the resolution most likely is referring to mining, oil, ect. I will be narrowing what I argue in this debate to 1 or 2 nations. The main conduit for my arguments will be through the country of Ethiopia, which I choose due to its direct history relating to this debate, and that I'm already knowledgable on green concerns over their. The audience should be aware, that if I can prove that at least one nation benefits more from resource extraction, then the entire BOP of my opponent is obliterated. Fortunately, I will also try to convey my messages on a international scale. II. New rules made in R2 My opponent has made two new rules in R2, that I was not ready nor aware of, and these should be diregarded. If you have rules you want listed, you must do this in R1, which you specifically made an acceptance round. I hope you can respect this, and these are the following two rules which will not apply to our debate.... 1. Argument made where enviormental protection directly conflict with resource extraction 2. Contentions (Only me), cannot be argued that hold both enviornmental and resource extraction equally. I am in opposition to both of these new rules, and the audience should not hold me by things stated after I accepted the debate. Please remember that when casting your vote. III. Water Problem There are a dozen African nations that have suffered serious droughts within the past decade. With droughts come crop shortages, or famine, and without food, everyone within the nation slowly starve. Including the middle class, who sustain the job creators, and slowly, you are left with a collapsed economy. These nations are completely desolate, and there is not enough food in the world to satisfy them all. Back in the 70's, their was a military junta called the Derg in Ethiopia. Suffering serious famines left most of the nation in serious pain. With a 10% literacy rate, and the majority of its citizens living in extreme poverty, it became the UN food bag of the world. Ethiopia has about 40 large river masses, but almost no irrigation. The Derg adopted a rapid industrialization policy that tore into the earth, forcing fast irrigation at low costs. Millions of lives were saved, and crop production soared, and while the nation was still hurt by the famine, in about 8 years, Ethiopia went from having a 10% literacy rate to a 63% one. Several other nations adopted this forced irrigation policy, and although it hurt the land, it uplifted millions into the middle class, and everyone else could survive on more than 30 grains of rice a day (Some people in Africa are lucky to get 10). Tell me that Africa should of sat their and watch the bodies pile up? IV/V. United Nations Millennium Goals vs United Nations International Poverty Benchmarks We all know the toll famine took on the world in the 70's. Let me explain the story of China, who was the only nation to achieve the UN international poverty benchmark, and they did it through prioritization of resource extraction over enviornmental protection. China, over a course of 20 years, lifted about 650 million people out of poverty. Do you know how they did this? They carved paths through rare earth deposits. They scorched land so it would grow back fertile. Many Chinese farmers began using intense pesticide formulas designed to kill swarms of bugs. This created a food, material, and population surplus. Not only does China have enough resources to build products itself, but it has millions of raw materials to ship to foreign manafacturers. It's clear how they did this. They took the earth for all it beared, and put that to use for the 650 million people making less than 1.25$ a day (Adjusted to USD). VI. Surplus of Money The ultimate goal for every modern capitalist, is to make net profit on investments. Not small profits, Large profit margins. Ussually enough to create a surplus of money. You see, green technology isn't used much because it's expensive. That's right, green technology like windmills or clean earth boreholes can cost up to twice as much in both upkeep and expenses than their normal counterparts. The universal theory in economics is that one must spend money to make money. The same applies here. A nation can afford to be more green later, if it is less green now. Mining companies can't make a profit if their nations start telling them to double their upkeep costs. Nor can impovershed farmers buy food if they are forced to use the expensive fatigucides imported from Germany. Third world nations are to poor already, and its easy to just say they need to be more green, but when you really start weighing the costs on a macro scale, your presented with millions of problems. The BOP requires my opponent to respond to this point with much detail. If nations can become profitable, then we can consider new fancy solar panels, or draining wharves (Don't know their real name). VIII. Conclusion The opposition has done nothing, besides stating all the benefits of being green. She has not told us all the details we need. How can nations afford it? Who's @ss do they need to kiss to get the resources. These are important questions, that have failed to be answered by her OP. Let's not insult the audience's intelligence. They already know the song and dance. Keep the world clean and preserved, and we'll be happy and beneficial in the long run! Yay! I would agree for a nation on the magnitude of the United States of France, but third world nations are ""undeveloped"" and for the most part, ""untouched"". We should not be opposed, and actually encourage, the beneficial exploitation of the resources that will allow them to become a more profitable and enviornmentally concious nation in the future."

S22d02825-A67377c81	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"A. the CBO I do not accuse the CBO of wrongdoing. I am, however, saying that the CBO was forced to work under the assumptions that the writers of the Health Care Bill made. With these assumptions, there is a very small decrease in the deficit. However, there are certainly some things that are wrong with this analysis. First, the huge amount of revenue expected to come from tax increases on the rich will certainly not all materialize. There will be at least some behavioral response to these tax increases, resulting in less reported income. As for Medicare, I would argue that Holtz-Eakin is exactly right that ""saving"" $463 Billion is unrealistic. Talking about Medicare savings in a campaign is much easier than actually making cuts in practice. This is especially true in light of the fact that the party that will be in charge of these ""savings"" is the same party that will likely run their entire 2012 campaign in support of traditional Medicare. It would be hard for this same party to then cut $463 Billion from the program they focused an entire campaign on. Based on these realities, I would still argue that the CBO report has some significant shortcomings, and just slightly adjusting for some of these shortcomings shows Health Care Reform adding to the Deficit. On another note, I would love to debate government run Health Care with my opponent. I will now respond to the arguments that my opponent made for Health Care Reform: A. Small Business Con argues that Health Care Reform will help small business. I will respond to that argument here. In his last post, my opponent argues that the Health Care Bill will help small business by allowing them to pay less for Health Insurance. My opponent seems to ignore the vast new complex regulations created by the Health Care Bill. There will be pages of new regulations and forms, making it harder to start a new business. To make things worse, the Health Care Bill will actually INCREASE the cost for Health Care. Basic economics tells us that more regulations and complexities will increase costs. On top of this, there a number of surcharges on Insurance Companies in the Health Care Reform Bill, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. My opponent also mentions a tax credit that is supposed to help small businesses buy insurance. This is true, but the bill also includes large tax increases that will hit a significant number of Small Businesses. This will, overall, hurt small businesses. Finally, I stronly disagree with the idea that Health Care Reform will improve Health Outcomes. The Health Care Bill largely relies on an expansion of Medicaid to increase access. However, as the studies I mentioned in my last post showed, Medicaid Patients do not get much better access to Health Care than uninsured patients. Likewise, the bill will lead to much larger Health Care wait times and less Medical Innovation. This could actually, in the long run, lead to worse, not better, Health Outcomes. B. Lives Will be Saved I agree completely here. However, I don't see it as very humane to have 41% of people waiting 2 or more months to see a specialist (as they do in Canada). It is also not humane to have a government system that virtually puts a halt to Medical Innovation (new medicines and technologies aren't coming from Canada or Britain). Me and my opponent seem to have different views of what is humane. It seems that my opponent believes that Health Decisions are too important for individuals to make in a private market, and should therefore be made by the government. I believe the exact opposite, that Health Care Decisions are so important that only individuals and free markets are capable of bringing about the best possible outcomes. C. The Patients Bill of Rights My opponent posts the Patients Bill of Rights (I add my comment after the point): .Stop insurance companies from limiting the care you need.- My Comment: Insurance Companies may limit care, but not to the extent that governments do. I would like to see a consumer driven system where individuals were in complete control of their own Health Care. However, I do not see why Government Rationing is so preferrable to Insurance Company rationing (especially if Insurance Companies involve much less rationing). .Remove insurance company barriers between you and your doctor.- My Comment: Again, I don't want an Insurance Company between me and my Doctor, but I would prefer the Insurance Company to the Government. However, I would like to see a system that is dominated by individuals, not Insurance Companies or the Government. .Reviewing Insurers' Premium Increases.- My Comment: I'm not sure what exactly this entails. If it means price controls, then this is a major problem. Price controls restrict supply and lead to chronic shortages. There is no doubt that prices are a huge problem in our system, but price controls are not the answer. .Getting the Most from Your Premium Dollars.- My Comment: This basically means that the government is going to force Insurance companies to spend on certain things. This is a terrible idea. The government cannot dictate how Insurance Companies need to spend their money like the private market should be able to. This is a good talking point, but is a policy mess in practice. It will lead to all sorts of corruption, while failing to improve quality. .Keeping Young Adults Covered.- My Comment: Again, this means that the government forces young adults to buy Insurance. Why this is a goal is a mystery to me. If a young adult does not want Health Insurance, they should not be forced to buy it. .Providing Affordable Coverage to Americans without Insurance due to Pre-existing Conditions- My Comment: Yes, those with pre-existing conditions need to be covered. However, forcing insurance companies to cover them will raise prices for everyone. If Insurance Companies are forced to cover everyone, people will have an incentive to wait until they are very sick to buy insurance. If they are required to insure them at a low cost, as they are in the Bill, these costs will be passed on to other insurance patients. If price controls are imposed to stop these (as they may be under the bill), shortages will result. Instead of this, we should give block grant payments to every state to allow them to find their own solutions to this problem. This is not a perfect solution, but it seems like the most practical"	PRO	44

Aside from the fact that taxes are necessary for our government to even exist (let alone function), the government isn't ""stealing"" when it taxes its citizens.

S22d02825-Aa56b0200	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"REBUTTAL 3 a. ""the huge amount of revenue expected to come from tax increases on the rich will certainly not all materialize."" Please explain why this is the case, in the next round, with sources. Until then, the point is moot. b. ""Talking about Medicare savings in a campaign is much easier than actually making cuts in practice."" The bill is not some campaign speech. The method of saving is written into law.

Whether medicaid is good quality or not is irrelevant to the fact that it is giving care to people who otherwise would not have it. g. ""I agree completely here."" So...you agree that the health care reform bill saves lives and you still disagree with it's implementation. That leaves me to ask you, what is the price of a human life?

""I'm not sure what exactly this entails."" View my source for explanation. k. ""Again, this means that the government forces young adults to buy Insurance."" False. You didn't view the source for further explanation as I suggested. This means no one will have to buy insurance until they are 26 because they will be allowed to be kept on their parents insurance. l. ""Yes, those with pre-existing conditions need to be covered. However, forcing insurance companies to cover them will raise prices for everyone."" So lets see, on one hand we have sick people unable to get care because it was preexisting. On the other hand we have those who are non-senior(due to medicare) adults who aren't poor(due to medicaid) that don't want to pay higher prices. Who's side should we take? CONCLUSION Many of Pro's points would be redundant to reply to because they were not properly substantiated. I expect further substantiation in the rest of the debate. Also, I'd like to point out an opinion of mine. Insurance companies are just as much a form of government as the official one. Regulating an inherently authoritarian system does not increase it's degree of authoritarianism. As a Socialist, I would actually prefer to abolish insurance companies and have their service controlled by the people."	CON	46
S14e017ba-A6257ca47	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Thanks Contra. == Rebuttal == 1) Overutilization My opponent misconstrues the RAND study. When co-pays are reduced, people seek more ""inappropriate or unnecessary medical services."" The Dartmouth study found that when health care is free, if you double the number of doctors, people will visit the doctor twice as often. My opponent cites 24 pages of some book to show ""fewer would actually go to the doctor"" but I doubt this claim, the claim is empirically disproven, and I cannot access said book to see what it says. Overuse is a serious problem in running up costs. A government study in France concluded that the French, because drugs are free, demand drugs at rates three times their peers in other countries, and drug outlays are responsible for the huge deficit in French health care. [1] Does preventative care save money? First of all, blood pressure medication is covered under private insurance and so are cancer screenings. Secondly, the literature disagrees with my opponent. A meta-analysis by the New England Journal of Medicine of 599 studies found that on average, the costs of prevention and treatment are the same, and ""Although some preventive measures do save money, the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not."" [2] The Congressional Budget Office also concluded that under universal health care, ""preventative care will raise – not cut – costs"" because so many healthy people will start overusing screening and prevention. [3] Smart cards Taiwan is unique in using smart cards; the US doesn't use them for Medicare or Medicaid, and the ACLU and other civil liberty groups oppose them on privacy grounds. Thus, my opponent can't prove we would start using them. And they don't save that much money. In Taiwan, the system is nearing bankruptcy, as ""the government is borrowing from banks to pay what there isn't enough to pay the providers."" [4] While my opponent is correct that if someone saw a specialist 20 times a month, we'd flag their file, even if everyone saw a specialist only three times a month, that is still enough overuse to bankrupt the system, yet not enough to raise a red flag. 2) USA already rations care? This isn't true. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act requires emergency rooms to treat the uninsured. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the breast cancer survival rate for uninsured women (who used the ER) was higher than for woman using Medicaid. [5] It's better to use the ER than to have government insurance in the US. Also, Obamacare provides a private sector solution: subsidies and state insurance pools to help the poor afford health insurance. We don't need a single payer system to achieve universal coverage; we can do it through the private sector and avoid the disadvantages of single payer. My opponent argues that we currently have enough doctors and enough equipment not to have to ration care. However, those doctors and equipment exist because private insurers are willing to pay for them. When the government lowers reimbursement rates fewer doctors are willing to accept patients. Approximately 20% of all doctors and nearly half of all primary care physicians won't accept Medicare patients anymore, and that number is projected to double with the new 21% cut in reimbursement rates. In addition, 20% of doctors said they would quit under a single payer system due to lower pay. The U.S. has far more MRI's per capita than any other (single payer) country, precisely because private insurance is willing to pay for these machines. Making reimbursement rates similar to Medicare, as opposed to the higher rates offered by private insurance, *will* lead to rationing. My opponent claims if we have to ration care, we will do so in a ""fair"" way. When France had a shortage in beta interferon, it held a lottery to decide which hepatitis patients would live and which would die. I'd rather avoid government-caused shortages than resort to such ""fairness."" 3) Wait lists My opponent's wait list argument comes down to the argument that the current supply of medical treatment will remain the same even when we start paying less for it. This contradicts the basic theory of supply: that suppliers base their supply decision on the price people are willing to pay and exit the market when that price is too low. I can't locate any of my opponent's claims about Canadian wait times and satisfaction in his source. It's not true that 80% of Canadians like their health care. ""According to a recent poll called The National Pulse on Health Strategy, 80 percent of Canadians want major reforms to the health care system."" [6] However, according to a Gallup poll, 80 percent of all Americans are satisfied with the current level of medical care available to them. [7] Wait times in Canada are not declining and are not just for elective procedures. The average wait time for a cardiac bypass (an emergency procedure to stop heart attacks) is 65 days; average wait time for an MRI is 126 days; average wait time for breast cancer treatment is 168 days. [6] And remember, in Canada, ""Only half of ER patients are treated in a timely manner by national and international standards, according to a government study."" My opponent says once again that single payer countries have better results, but these rankings measure health outcomes based on life expectancy, which includes car accidents, homicide rates, and many other irrelevant factors. If you look at effectiveness at the point of intervention, the US ranks #1 in 5 year cancer survival rates. 4) Quality in the US The doctor poll my opponent cited here talks about a ""national health insurance program,"" which could mean single payer or a private sector approach, like Obama's. My opponent says here that France doesn't have physician shortages due to low pay. He clearly didn't read my source from earlier (footnote 20). It says that a national association of doctors called CNOM, much like the AMA here, ""is concerned over 'medical desert' areas."" A study by CNOM found that 19 of 22 regions have seen a steep decline in the number of doctors. He claims we could have loan forgiveness for doctors, but we could do that now as well. If we cut pay by two thirds, to be consistent with physician pay in France, we will lose a ton of doctors, even if we make medical school cheaper. 5) Death Panels My opponent says his Death Panel doesn't decide to disallow care, it just decides which treatments not to cover. If the Death Panel is forced not to cover expensive treatments, I don't see how poor people are any better off under this system. They have government health care that doesn't cover anything. This is essentially what Medicaid is now, which is why uninsured breast cancer survival rates were higher than people enrolled in Medicaid. Also, remember the studies that Canada's poor have worse health outcomes than the poor in the US and health outcomes for the poor have not improved in England since they implemented their single payer system in 1948. Between rationing, wait times, and death panels denying treatment, the poor do not find themselves better off under single payer systems. 6) Drug innovation To combat my study, my opponent again cites the same 24 pages from some book. Many new drugs are based on private research, not government research, which is why countries with single payer price controls lose $22 billion annually from drug research and lose 13 new drug launches each year. What was the last time the government invented and patented a new drug? Regardless, single payer countries like Canada are so overburdened paying for overuse of medical treatments that they cannot afford R&D. I already cited a source that showed that Canada can't afford to spend any money on R&D, so their R&D budget is near zero. 7) Cost I don't know where my opponent gets his figure that we could pay for government health care with a 2% income tax increase. France needs a 20% income tax to pay for their system. I cited a projection that the average family would need to pay $14,000 per year in taxes for single payer health insurance. The economic recovery is finally showing some momentum. If you take away 7% of employer profits (through taxes), this would mean much slower job growth since employers will have much less money for job expansions. Many employers cannot afford this tax since profit margins for them are lower than 7%. My opponent doesn't bother answering the cost to the government, which would be more than the 40% of government revenue in France, since his proposed taxes don't cover the cost of the system. I also 100% win that Medicare and Medicaid suck and result in drug shortages. If the government can't run services well for a part of the population, it won't be any better at implementing these same services for everyone. I also 100% win that Medicare has higher bureaucratic costs, so we actually lose money to bureaucracy by switching to government insurance. My opponent concedes this so I turn this point against him and thus prove that you should vote Con to save money due to wasteful bureaucratic costs associated with government inefficiency.

S2d55d1c3-Aec9fc270	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	"Please note that my basic argument is against socialization of any privately produced goods or services and so my examples of capitalism will only be those which are strictly free market examples and that otherwise I shall use logic to support my virtually laissez-faire position as there have not yet been any completely laissez-faire economies to draw from and the only nation that came close was the early U.S which was still ripe with cronyism (http://mises.org...). To begin with your first premise, I must disagree with what you consider essential services. Essential services should be services which protect the individual rights of personal property, choice, and justice thus meaning that essential government services would be those of the police (domestic protection), courts (justice), and military (protection from foreign invasion). This definition of essential services should not be extended to services which can and should be provided by private industry such as healthcare, education, food/housing, and transportation. There are plenty of private healthcare companies in the U.S. that not only provide good healthcare but can also profit from it including Cleveland Clinic (http://en.wikipedia.org...), Mayo Clinic, and others (http://www.forbes.com...). The reason that this should be handled by private industry and free markets rather than the government is that the free market system encourages competition for the patronage of the market thanks to profit incentive and self interest. This competition results in private industry trying to provide the best possible good or service for the lowest possible price. This is why people in the U.S. today are much healthier and live much longer than we did in the 1700s, it has not been because of big government, if government could realistically and effectively provide socialized healthcare, it would have happened by now and vast numbers of people in the U.S. would be flying to places like Cuba and Canada for healthcare. As it is, at least in Canada""s case, they""re coming here for their healthcare (http://www.forbes.com... page 3). Private industry can also cheaply cover education. Of course, currently, private schools are very expensive while public schools(K-12) are not from an out of pocket point of view. However, the reason for this is that public education exists. Because the government has set up a public education system which from an out of pocket perspective is virtually free, that has driven the lower cost private schools off the market leaving only the high rate private institutions. Now one would tend to wonder, ""If it""s so cheaply provided by government then why shouldn't""t it stay public?"" The answer is that it is not really as cheap as it appears. For public schooling, you don""t have to pay out of pocket for the education of your children, it is paid for by taxes. These taxes however don""t just come from the individuals who send their children to school, but also from those who do not have children, or whose children are not old enough to attend school. Also, just to get a sense of the cost on U.S. citizens from the federal level, the DoE spent about $72.8 billion on K-12 education (http://www.downsizinggovernment.org...) and when factoring in dead weight losses, or the taxman""s fee as I call it, which range between 20 cents to 1 dollar more taxed for every dollar spent (http://www.downsizinggovernment.org...), then the actual cost in terms of money taxed is between $87.36 billion and $145.6 billion which figures out to about $276.46 per person at the low end, and $460.76 at the high end (http://www.census.gov...). Of course, not all of this comes from taxes because quite a large portion of all federal spending comes from deficit spending which can also be harmful as explained by Salim Furth of the Heritage Foundation (http://www.heritage.org...). As to food and housing, it should be quite obvious as to how private industry can provide those as this area of the market has likely been privately run since the founding of the U.S. and when we compare nations in which the free market is allowed to produce and distribute food and housing to those where it isn't, we find that the free market societies have more higher quality of both than socialist societies, the U.S. when compared with the USSR is a perfect example of this. Transportation also belongs in the free market. Examples of successful privately run transportation systems include Heathrow Airport in London, air traffic control in Canada, and some highways in France (http://www.cato.org...). Another reason that free markets should run transportation is because if the government can control transportation, or any market really, it acts like a permanent monopoly on the good or service and when someone has a permanent monopoly, then competition disappears and inefficient production and distribution as well as poor quality products result and the monopolist can use its power to control people as a quote from Leon Trotsky revealed In a country where the sole employer is the state, opposition means death by slow starvation. The old principle, who does not work shall not eat, has been replaced by a new one: who does not obey shall not eat. As to my opponent""s second premise, I agree in that the mentioned services should be part of the free market. As to the third premise, legal regulation is not necessary because it is not in the best interest of a business to defraud its employees or customers because of competition. By defrauding them, the employees and customers will begin to look for another more competitive source of work and products leaving the business who defrauded them to fail. Also, environmental regulation would not be necessary in a free market society because there is still the court service, which I mentioned above in my answer to premise 1, to help to determine if property damage was incurred and how much compensation must be provided for the damage. This is one of the beauties of the capitalist system, property rights. As long as a business continues to do property damage by harming the environment, it will continue to face lawsuits which even if not all successful, will still raise operating costs by having to divert capital to corporate lawyers and court fees thus creating an incentive for the business to look into ways of preventing environmental damage and creating a new market in more efficient and more environmentally sound producer and consumer goods. The last regulation you mention is regulation against monopolies which also is not necessary because monopolies are unlikely in a free market where little other regulation exists and taxes are low because of the constantly growing wealth and the changing face of the market due to new innovations and investments. This changing market thus results in frequent destruction of old industries and markets and creation of new ones forcing businesses to continue to adapt and keeping competition alive thus preventing monopolies naturally. Also, even in the unlikely event of a monopoly forming naturally on the free market, it is not certain to last for too long because of this changing market. This monopoly of the old market will still be threatened by the potential competition of the current one and the innovations of tomorrow""s market making it difficult to sustain a monopoly and if they can sustain it through producing innovations which make their products better or cheaper, then there is no need to worry about the monopoly."

Scde43845-A50fe02c5	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Thanks to Con for a vigorous debate on a controversial topic. I think readers interested in the subject will benefit. It boils down to tree trade producing winners and losers. Theory predicts and experience bears out that overall prosperity increases dramatically under free trade. The opposition is based upon the equality of poverty achieved by protectionism. Countries get to choose whether they want the prosperity and inequality of Hong Kong or the uniform poverty of Maoist China. I claim prosperity is better. Comparative Advantage Con quotes a survey of the general population [C7] saying that the populace favors trade restrictions. I never made a claim about what the general public favors. I presented the theory of comparative advantage and cited data that professional economists believe the theory works in practice. Con cited leftist Nobel economist Paul Krugman, but it turns out that Krugman favors free trade. It's no accident that Krugman favors free trade he received his Nobel prize for work on international trade. [12. http://en.wikipedia.org...] Right-wing Nobel economist Milton Friedman favors free trade. Wikipedia summarizes, ""The academic debate among economists is currently settled in favor of free trade, with a consensus having existed since at least the 1960s ..."" [1] Perhaps Wikipedia is biased, but since left and right agree, we don't know which side they might be biased towards. The general public is suspicious of free trade for the reason I cited in R2, the benefits are spread among all consumers, but dislocations are acute and easy to point to. The general public often holds contradictory opinions. If we asked the public if they wanted a substantial increase in prices to keep non-competitive companies in business, it's a safe bet thy would be as opposed to that as they are to unrestricted trade. Comparative advantage ensures that workers indeed benefit overall from free trade, The benefits come as generally lowered prices. The theory of comparative advantage is so well established that it isn't necessary to refute each and every type of trade restriction. Buffet's plan tries to pass the burden of balancing trade to individual importers industry. What, for example, would Exxon export in return for the certificates needed to import oil? They have nothing, so they would simply stop importing and let gasoline prices skyrocket. The particulars of trade restrictions need not be argued. Trade Deficits If one allows that traffic accidents are bad, does that concede that automobiles ought to be banned? By Con's logic it should. If we banned automobiles, we would have no traffic accidents. That would save all the money spent treating injuries from accidents and on buying automobiles and gasoline. The costs, of an immobile society are more difficult to calculate, but we know they are greater. Similarly, banning free trade to force a trade balance is certainly a net loss because the logic of comparative advantage is sound. Con argues that because trade deficits cannot be run perpetually, then trade restrictions should be put in place to ensure they never occur at all. Con works from the notion that trade deficits can only be paid for by exhausting finite natural resources, and those resources will necessary run out. But if a country lacks natural resources, forcing a positive trade balance will not solve the shortage. If a country needs oil, for example, forbidding imports of oil doesn't solve that problem. A country lacking natural resource must adopt policies that make it competitive in areas that do not depend on natural resources to generate trade. such policies are evident, with Switzerland and Hong Kong being good examples of countries that do quite well without natural resources. I did not argue that the trade deficit is a savings problem in disguise. I argued that the trade deficit is the result of government policies that restrict immigration of skilled workers, produced failed basic and higher education systems, ban development of natural resources, and government overspending that sucks up capitol. If people saved more to support government spending the capitol would still be locked up in non productive use. Con did not dispute my list of policy reasons. Con argues that the Federal government pays interest on the trade deficits. No, the Federal government pays interest on the debt it has accumulated from overspending. Trade deficits are entirely private. Free trade is sustainable indefinitely because if deficits by a company accumulate, eventually the interest rates rates lenders charge the company rise, discouraging further buying. If Wal-Mart buys goods from China it can pay for them with overseas earnings as well as U.S. earnings. If their ability to pay becomes doubtful, they won't be permitted to buy. Competition Con's implies that aircraft is the only significant high tech export from the U.S. That's wrong. The top ten U.S. exports, in order, are: aircraft, semiconductors, autos, pharmaceuticals, auto parts, fuel oil, industrial machines, auto parts, organic chemicals, telecommunications, and plastics. Fuel oil and plastics are essentially manufactured goods, since the us is a net imported of petroleum used to produce the products. [13. http://www.worldsrichestcountries.com...] The list continues with many agricultural products, but even those products have a large technological component, because the U.S. is competitive in those products due high levels of automation. The net balance of trade in any particular area is not an important indicator because U.S. companies get the benefits of overseas manufacturing: ""However, a country’s gains from productive activities are not fully captured by a location-based measure of production, such as GDP. Many U.S. companies produce abroad and import a substantial proportion of their final product to U.S. markets (e.g., Nike). Such production logistics contribute dollar-for-dollar to our trade deficit. However, they are in no way an indication that we are consuming more than we are producing. Rather, the trade deficit fails to account for U.S. gains from U.S.-owned production overseas.""[14. http://www.nicholls.edu...] It's better to have rich people than not, because the rich invest, and because the rich can be taxed. We should seek prosperity, not economic equality. Evidence Chile and Brazil are greatest success stories in Latin America, and their success is a result of adopting policies of free trade. Oddly, Con points to the regime of Allende in Chile as an example of the success of trade restrictions. Poverty was pervasive, so there were fewer difference between rich and poor than there are under the modern era of prosperity under free trade. One might as well use Mao's China as a shining example of economic equality. Chile is enormously better off with the prosperity brought by free trade. [15. http://www.natlaw.com...] The same is true of Brazil and other countries now prospering from free trade. The equality achieved by universal poverty is lost, while the country as a whole gains dramatically. Con does not dispute the long list of free trade success stories, ranging from Hong Kong and Singapore to India and China. Right to buy products In R2, I argued that consumers have a right to buy competitively priced products. Moreover, if the they are denied that right, government must set up a process by which it determines which uncompetitive industries will be supported and by how much. That government process is inherently both inefficient and corrupt. It's inefficient because bureaucrats must be employed to set prices which free markets do without cost. It's corrupt, because industries must attempt to curry government favor to get the best subsidies. Con has not adequately respond. The Pro case is made. The U.S. should embrace free trade policies."

S3cd3a05e-A9b7899a	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"Political motions are always divisive, but this one lies right at the top of the scale. It's two years after the recession and now, in the American election, a lot of what the international media is showing is a great argument among the presidential hopefuls as to how America can be made to be as prosperous as possible. The question is - is that even desirable? Or should the governments of America and other countries aim primarily for a more equal distribution of wealth, given how some Americans are in greater poverty than ever before, while others seem only to get wealthier and wealthier? Definitions Since the motion is incredibly vague, let me define my idea of ""economic equality"". Economics is all about standard of living. Having an equal standard of living means that we get fair compensation for our work, and that we get work to do. This involves three processes. First, work must be fair, so employers can't discriminate or treat their employees badly. Second, work must provide adequate compensation to all employees to allow them to have a standard of living, but not so much that a few elites can control access to certain commodities. This is where stuff like minimum wage laws and progressive taxation comes into play, which in many ways are the most important things governments can do. Third, it means governments must do all they can to fight unemployment (I suspect we'll find some common ground here) insofar as people are able to work. In a nutshell, economic equality means we all have equal access to a standard of living, regardless of things like our backgrounds or what suburb we live in. I intend to justify all of this when the debate starts - I merely put it here so that there is no confusion over what I am actually arguing for in this debate. My opponent is free to define how exactly he measures prosperity. Tautological definitions should be ignored. The question in this debate is not whether a prosperous society or an equal society is to be preferred. They're not necessarily mutually exclusive. The question is which option governments should generally encourage (notwithstanding exceptional circumstances), in cases where a policy decision can only work in favor of one or the other. As per usual in debating, all other words have their standard dictionary definitions. Structure Please only accept this debate if you're RoyLatham. If you're not Roy, then do not accept this debate. He and I have been wanting to do this debate for some time. The burden of proof is mine. This is an acceptance/definitions/setup round.

Sed146d2b-A4e8aee1c	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	"Since there are over 100 taxes, I will pick 7 that we will debate. The 7 are: The Income Tax. The National Retail Sales Tax. The Payroll Tax. Property Taxes. Excise Taxes (on things like Cigarettes, Tobacco, Alcohol, Firearms, etc...). Corporate Taxes. Gasoline and Carbon Taxes. Now for the opening debates: Tax 1 (The Income Tax): I will split this into two parts. First Point: Raising the Income Tax right now will kill the economy. This is simple economics. Right now, the more consumer money spent, the less we will be in an economic slump. Consumer buying increases aggregate demand, which in turn increases supply, thus raising GDP. Raising the income tax would take money away from consumers that they would otherwise spend. ""Since the economy is already growing so slowly, why in the world would we want to implement a 3.8 trillion dollar tax hike by letting the Bush tax cuts expire? That would be like planting a steel-toe boot to the skull of the economy when itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½„ï¿½s already on the ground, bleeding."": http://rightwingnews.com.... Second Point: The Income Tax is too Progressive. The disprarity between the rich's tax rate and the poor's tax rate is astounding. The top 1% pay a 45% income tax, while the bottom 47% pay no income taxes. Not to mention, raising taxes on the rich would prevent money that would have previously gone into creating new businesses or investing in new ones, thus creating jobs, would be gone. ""The rich in America obviously have lots of money, but there are simply not enough of them to fund the presidentï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½s preferred level of spending.""""They find that tax increases tend to reduce economic growth, stating that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½""tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½""an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by almost three percent.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½‚ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½: http://american.com.... ""Importantly, any meaningful increases in taxes from personal income would have to come from lower and middle income families, as 90% of all personal taxable income is generated below the taxable income level of $35,000.: http://www.devvy.com.... Decrease taxes, help the economy. Tax 2 (The National Retail Sales Tax): Again, I will split this up into two points. First Point: Raising the National Retail Sales Tax right now will kill economic growth. This has a more profound effect during a recession than raising the income tax does. This charges people extra to help the economy! How silly is that? If we raise the sales tax, the Government would be in essence encouraging people not to buy, and therefore, not to help the economy! ""This tax increase would take over one billion dollars out of the hands of North Carolina working families and put it back into government coffers.""""They seem to forget that the sales tax affects everyone, and has a greater impact on working people and senior citizens on fixed incomes. Everyone loses more money if we raise the sales tax, including those who are unemployed."": http://www.beaufortobserver.net.... Second Point: The sales tax is exteremely unnecessary expect in extreme inflation periods. The sales tax is unneccesary even in a normal economy because you are still penalizing the consumer for shopping. Why would you do that? That is what keeps the economy afloat. Decrease taxes, help the economy. Tax 3 (The Payroll Tax): I will split this into two points. First Point: The Payroll Tax is extremely unneccesary. Most of the revenue drawn from the payroll tax goes back to them in later years through social security, but in small amounts. Social Security should be to the choice of the worker. If the worker does not want social security in later life, than the Federal Government should not forceibly take his money to fund a project that he or she does not even want. It is not the Government's Obligation, Job, or Duty to make people save. That is the individual's decision, and they have the right to choose for themselves. Second Point: A cut of the payroll tax is good for small businesses. ""You have to spend money to take advantage of that tax credit, but if a small business is thinking about expanding, it provides more certainty for them to schedule an expansion or upgrade."": http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com.... Small business has taken the brunt of the recession's fury, and an increase in the payroll taxes would make the financial and economic situation even worse. In fact, cutting them would help the economy in many ways. Tax 4 (Property Taxes): I will not go in to much detail on these taxes, but they are even more unnecessary than the top three. Why would you tax someone on the amount of land they own or the inheritance they receive? Especially the inheritance taxes. I mean the poor receive inheriatances too. It' is not just the rich. ""It (property taxes) doesn't work so well when it is used to redistribute wealth on a grand scale. "": http://www.tax.com.... ""The tax (the estate and inheritance taxes) also is very expensive to comply with. A 1992 National Tax Journal study found the compliance cost was $1 for every $1 raised. Combining these costs with the reduction in output it causes, it is clear the estate tax is a burden on the U.S. economy.""""The estate tax makes it difficult to make economic decisions and results in unintended consequences, the burden of which falls primarily on the lower and middle classes. Rather than giving in to the politics of envy, we should have a tax structure that encourages innovation and saving. That is how the poor will become wealthy."": http://www.mrc.org.... The main reason for these taxes is to tax the rich even more. Which one, I have proven will worsen the economy, and two, these taxes don't just effect the targeted rich. Tax 5 (Excise Taxes): At first, they seem like a good idea to deter alcohol, smoking, and other bad habits. But when looked at closer, the same effect is going to happen as the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s. People are going to start selling ""tax-exmept"" alcohol and cigarettes underground, which will just one, increase crime, and two, have no effect on the usage of alcohol and cigarettes whatsoever. Also, why is it the Government's job to discourage bad behavior? (I mena stuff that is not illegal). Why is it the Government's job to stop people from drinking or smoking? If the people are dumb enough to do those things, than they should suffer the consequences. Is kind of a tax is unconstitutional because the Government is stepping over it's bounds. Tax 6 (Corporate Taxes): These taxes have the same effect as taxing the rich. They kill the economy. If an economy is trying to recover from a recession, than a decrease in income and sales taxes coupled with a decrease in corporate taxes will not only allow consumers to buy more, but it will allow producers and distributors to sell more to keep up with the increasing demand. Taxing profit is bad enough. Taxing the entire business is terrible. Why would you tax a business that is making a loss? And taxing profit is preventing the business from re-investing the profit back into the business to increase wages, fix equipment, and produce more. ""Corporations should NOT be taxed. This is beneficial to the corporation, consumer, economy, and government tax revenue.""""If taxes go down, product prices go down (Think Wal-Mart). Corporate taxes are where the consumer gets reamed. Every purchase you make, you are paying corporate taxes."": http://visiontoamerica.org... benefits of no corporate taxes are simple. No taxes mean cheaper COGS, which mean cheaper goods and services for the consumer. Cheaper goods and services for the consumer mean your money goes further and you can purchase more. The more you purchase, the more products need to be made, which eventually requires corporate investments and employee hiring. Eventually, you have more business generated for corporations which eventually lowers prices to stay competitive, higher employment which means more spending in the economy, and lastly a higher tax revenue from the larger economy and increased employment.: http://godfatherpolitics.com.... Tax 7 (The Gasoline and Carbon Taxes): Raising, or even having, a Gasoline Tax makes the price of Gasoline already higher than it should be. Gasoline could be a lot lower if the tax was gone. Now of course, the goal of these taxes is like the excise taxes, so that people will use less gasoline. But one, we do not need them right now, and two, they don't work. ""Raising the gas tax would heap yet another burden on New Jersey residents and employers already struggling to afford to live and do business here."": http://www.politickernj.com.... Now the Carbon Tax will fail. It will not discourage people from using Carbon. But the real big one is the taxes on business using carbon and coal in production. This will yet again hurt the economy due to lower production. And this system of Carbon taxes does not even work. ""Fear of dangerous Global Warming from man-made CO2 is dissipating with more recent scientific evidence and exposure of much bias, exaggeration of dangers and neglect of benefits of warming in existing scientific consensus. Any warming from CO2 is likely to be a harmless < 1 Deg Celsius by 2100. Higher predictions are only computer model speculations, arguably due to the modeller's confessed ignorance of natural climate cycles."" ""Even if CO2 were dangerous and we reduced it successfully in Australia or even globally, there is no physical evidence that it would have a significantly beneficial effect on climate."": http://www.nocarbontax.com.au.../. Taxes in General: I have shown on several occasions that most taxes are either unnecessary, worthless, or harmful to the economy. They need to be cut to help the economy and to help business."	PRO	52
S3cd3a05e-A8e433323	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"I thank my opponent for having this debate with me. It's been lots of fun. In this round I will summarize the key issues in the debate. Ruling elite As should be fairly obvious, a society with an ""elite"" is the very opposite of an ""equal"" society by definition, but as I've already pointed out, entirely conductive to prosperity. My opponent didn't respond to that part. My opponent's fallacy is in the point he labels four - the requirement of a ruling elite to carry out those policies. You don't need an elite to monitor giving everybody equal access to the courts. You don't need an elite to implement progressive taxes. You don't need an elite for minimising unemployment. These policies are being enacted in states all around the globe without the establishment of ruling elites or distribution councils. Why? Because these are all objective rules - there is no subjective element that an elite would be required for. Furthermore, the fact that members of Soviet Russia's (or Mao's China's, or North Korea's) inner party do not have a standard of living equal to everybody else shows that they are far from being committed to equality. I agree that valuing economic equality doesn't always mean it results, but the same is true of prosperity - to err is human. Free markets My opponent claims I can't explain Hong Kong or Singapore. Singapore is a country that has historically had high equality, with a Gini coefficient about 0.2 below the world average, but it used to be about 0.4 below the world average (which would make it among the most equal societies in the world had it not changed) (http://tinyurl.com...). About 40 years ago the government began to aim for prosperity, and unsurprisingly poverty has increased massively since then. A recent government report said ""Evidence from economic research indicates that income inequality can have profound ill effects... It creates price distortion which can push low income families into poverty... Thus inequity can rob Singapore of the very factors – law and order and efficiency, which placed Singapore at the helm of the globalized world."" (http://tinyurl.com...). But there's something I want to say about Hong Kong also, which is a new example con has brought up. When Russia embarked on their experiment it lasted over 75 years before falling apart. Germany's experiment fell apart early because they were proud of the inequality they were creating, but it never fell apart on its own, and even became more and more productive when all the factories were being blown up (http://tinyurl.com...). Henry Ford is so well-regarded in America today because the experiment worked long enough for thousands of cars to be produced, making the automobile affordable (at the time a very remarkable feat). So creating a caste system of ""haves"" and ""have nots"" certainly does work for a while - but eventually it all falls to pieces. Hong Kong has fallen to pieces twice already - after the 1998 Asian financial crisis and after the SARS outbreak. They lasted a mere 25 years. What did Hong Kong then do? They ENDED their prosperity experiment (http://tinyurl.com...)! The Hong Kong we know today has, for the past decade, been moving further and further away from free markets - and their economy has been doing better than ever! I've proven time and time again, both by empirical example and by economic analysis that unregulated free markets don't work. You need REGULATED free markets. These ensure equality, and that ensures prosperity. Effects of regulation I agreed that the minimum wage usually causes a short-term increase in unemployment, but I provided economic analysis in round two that in the long-term, countries with a high minimum wage are better off. This analysis has never been refuted - only the examples I used to support it. I talked about Luxembourg; my opponent constantly reiterates that it's their attractive industries. Many countries have attractive industries - but there's a reason they're not as rich as Luxembourg. I've said it many times before - it's because they believe in equality and have a high minimum wage, as well as a healthy unemployment benefit. I also talked about the Netherlands, and my opponent talked about their crisis of the early 80s. This is because the government enacted the right policy in the wrong way. For instance, they raised the minimum wage beyond an equitable level for everybody that worked. That's not conductive to economic equality, because it's assuming the whole economy is measured in monetary terms. It's not; it's measured in standard of living. Workers got a comparatively worse standard of living than those on benefits, and the economy collapsed. Since then the Dutch have been working to equalise their economy the proper way, and it's worked really well. The notion that the Netherlands is falling apart comes from a dated OECD study that agreed with me that the Dutch economy was ""strengthening"", although like all European nations, it faced challenges after the recent recession. Today the Netherlands have low inflation, low unemployment and well-above-average economic growth (http://tinyurl.com...). He also quickly mentioned the US, which I rebutted fully, and Sweden, which he has already proven didn't aim for equality, to which I agreed. Poverty/Investment This is the most important issue in our debate - does investment create or reduce poverty. We both agree it creates economic growth (though I've argued consumer spending can have the same effect). The basic principle is that money doesn't magically appear - one person having more means that another has less. I agree with my opponent that production (as opposed to money) is not a zero-sum game, but for that to support my opponent's contention, that would be supposing that if I invest in a company, then that production will benefit everybody. In a free market there is every incentive on the wealthy to invest only in companies that benefit themselves. Why invest in developing low-cost housing for the poor - that doesn't generate a return, nor does it help the investor in any other way! But investing in private helicopters - now that's a wise investment, because it not only generates a return, but it benefits me because I buy private helicopters. What my opponent is advocating is called ""trickle-down economics"" - if you make the rich richer, you'll make the poor richer too, and get them out of poverty. It's no coincidence that in every one of the prosperity-nations we looked at the opposite happened. Making the rich richer makes the poor poorer because they have less control over how resources are allocated, and have less political influence. This holds true even if production increases - it will be the rich who get any marginal production, not the poor, because the rich own the factories and, for the simple reason of greed, have absolutely no incentive to raise wages in a free market. As New Zealand politician Damian O'Conner said, trickle-down economics is when the rich piss on the poor. What's the alternative? Equality. Con frequently says that's just making everybody poor. The reality is that nations high in equality do not have high rates of poverty, as I've demonstrated in many examples. The reality is that equality creates the incentives for massive long-run improvements in real purchasing power, as I've demonstrated in my analysis. And the reality is that aiming for prosperity has made everyone poor very frequently - except, always, for a small ruling elite. That's why Occupy happened. Wealth doesn't come from redistribution - but wealth isn't sustainable if the economy is controlled by a small, greedy, corrupt minority. Governments should, and must, do everything in their power to protect their people against this horrible, but very real, possibility. It's happened before. It will happen again. There is one thing my opponent and I have a consensus on - we must learn from the mistakes of the past. The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	53
S3cd3a05e-A5751cfaa	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"If a country is prosperous it can contemplate more redistribution of wealth than if it is not prosperous. Oil rich sheikdoms can distribute money to residents. If a country is not wealthy, it is more important to become wealthy than to ensure that poverty is equally distributed. A sure way for government to bring about economic equality is to make sure that everyone is poor. If it were true that equality should be valued more than prosperity, then governments should seek universal poverty. That's obviously not true, so the resolution fails. The Zero-Sum-Game Fallacy Pro begins with grievous mistake, that an economy is a zero sum game. The notion is well-debunked, including a book-length exposition. [13. http://www.amazon.com...] A simple example shows the error. Assume a small island nation with a constant money supply and only two farmers, A and B. A and B produce equal amounts of food. Suppose farmer B decides to stop producing. There would be food shortages and the price of food would increase significantly. The people on the island would spend more and have less food, so poverty would increase. Suppose instead, that the two farmers obtain, for the first time, some tractors that increase productivity. The islanders would then have more food at less cost, and prosperity would increase. Poverty and prosperity are functions of efficiency, and may rise and fall even if the money supply is held constant. If everyone decided to stop working in favor of receiving government checks, the result would be inevitable poverty. Pro originally argued that the Satisfaction with Life index correlated with equal distribution of income as measured by the Gini index. In the last round, I showed that was false. It's good to be rich, for sure. Norway derives wealth from North Sea oil which it has wisely invested, Qatar from vast oil supplies, Luxembourg from a unique position in international banking. Singapore derives it's wealth through free markets. None derived wealth from redistribution. Pro uses small countries as examples, because the overall economies can be dominated by a few special conditions. The Netherlands I explained why small economies are not good examples, but Pro insist that The Netherlands proves redistribution brings prosperity. Policies of redistribution brought the Netherlands to near bankruptcy in the early 1980s. they restored prosperity by changing to free market policies, and were prosperous again by the mid 1990s. ""During 1970-1982, the fiscal situation deteriorated dramatically … Public expenditures rose sharply, mainly as a result of an increase in transfers to households. … Important in these rising transfers was the rapid increase in the number of social security recipients: the number of unemployment, disability, sick leave, and welfare recipients more than doubled … Problems in the labor market were exacerbated by increases in the minimum wage, the introduction of minimum wages for young people, … and the elimination of the difference between the minimum benefit and the minimum wage."" [14. The Netherlands: transforming a market economy http://tinyurl.com... p. 4] ""The striking turnaround in the Netherlands economic performance over the past decade [to the mid 90s] … the policy reforms that included a firm monetary anchor, tight control over public expenditure, and reduced intervention in the economy. … major cuts in minimum wages for adults and even deeper cuts for youths … reducing the duration of unemployment benefits, … privatizing other benefits, and cutting the personal tax burden."" [14, p. 1] Having regained prosperity they returned to redistribution, an their economy is now sinking again. ""... the most pressing challenge for the near future is to prevent the cyclical increase in unemployment from becoming structural. ... the upturn is still supported by exceptional fiscal and monetary stimulus. ... as a result the deficit widened significantly and fiscal sustainability deteriorated. As economic growth strengthens, the government coming in after the June 2010 elections will be confronted with the task of consolidating public finances without putting the recovery at risk. The most crucial longer-term challenges are to secure fiscal sustainability and raise potential growth."" [15. Economic survey of the Netherlands 2010. [15. http://www.oecd.org...] The pattern in the Netherlands is similar to the U.S. and Sweden: prosperity brings redistribution, and that ultimately ends prosperity. Pro claims that prosperity came to China because of increasing foreign investment. So, does investment increase or decrease the concentration of wealth? One possibility is to promise investors that their investment will be seized and equitable redistributed to the workers. That's not likely to work. Another possibility is to impose a very high minimum wage, so that profits will be low. Or perhaps taxes could be made high so the profits could be taken by government for distribution. No, investment is only attracted by the understanding that capital will be preserved, profits will be made, and profits will not be seized and redistributed. Investment is concentration of wealth, not redistribution. Prosperity is increasing in China, and it is not just foreign investors. A middle class is rapidly developing, with an accompanying demand for automobiles and higher end goods. china is expected to soon be the world's largest market for luxury goods. There is no way to explain the prosperity in terms of valuing economic equality. It was abandoning the communist ideal that made the country prosperous. Why doesn't China impose a $100 minimum wage to solve the concerns over Apple's cheap labor? it's obvious. Abandoning democratic socialism in India has similarly increased their prosperity. The minimum wage Pro's minimum wage theory is refuted by the by the data. A high minimum wage causes unemployment as unprofitable operations are shut down, jobs are automated, or low-skilled workers are replaced by fewer high skilled workers. The Congressional Research Office found 99 academic studies of the effects of the minimum wage. Studies spanned fifty years worldwide. In all but three cases, unemployment increased when the minimum wage was raised. [16. http://web.archive.org... ] In the few cases where unemployment did not increase, the free market wages were already above the minimum wage, so there was no effect. The Ruling Elite My argument is: 1. Government values are expressed as policies. 2. valuing economic equality implies policies of redistribution. 3. Redistribution requires many decisions of who to take wealth from and who to give it to, and how much is to be transferred by what means. 4. Redistribution decisions are made by those who have ruling authority. 5. Therefore a ruling elite is required. A ruling elite might choose not to reward itself, but that rarely happens. One might imagine a theocracy of rulers who do not accumulate wealth, but I know of no examples. In the United States, government workers receive 45% more compensation than private sector counterparts. [17. http://online.wsj.com...] Progressive states like California have a more privileged elite than conservative states. My point is that valuing economic equality does not mean that economic equality results. The ruling elites in the Soviet Union and Mao's China no doubt valued economic equality, and there is every reason to believe the North Korean leaders also value economic equality. They correctly recognize that redistribution cannot be accomplished without a ruling elite empowered to redistribute. It's a part of the package. Prosperity derives from free markets Pro cannot explain why Hong Kong or Singapore are more successful than North Korea or China. It's their free economies."	CON	54
Sda116120-A3c3f169c	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	"I'm going to address PRO's Rd. 4 responses, and wrap this shindig up. Let's get to it. Once more, many thanks to PRO and all judges. PRO claims that the FT is simpler and more transparent. This is not the case because while the FT may only be 135 pages, it is a logistical nightmare because it places the sole point of collection at the retail level. Bartlett (2007), explains the implications: ""Massive evasion is inevitable with [FT] because all revenue would be collected at just one point in the entire economic system: ""the point of sale, which is the point of ""greatest evasion."" So, in abandoning the status quo to achieve transparency, PRO champions a system in which locates the sole point of collecting taxes is the point at which tax evasion is greatest -implicitly incentivizing corruption and reducing the government's ability to collect taxes altogether. It should also be noted that a ""simpler"" tax code does not imply a more ""transparent"" one. In simplifying regulation, PRO creates greater opportunity for evasion because of the impact his proposal will have on tax collection. He has furthermore not explained how the FT will not incentivize massive evasion, as Bartlett (2007) predicts and likewise ignored the reality that, as Sullivan (1995) articulates ""there is nothing in the history of the federal tax legislative process to suggest that a federal consumption tax would be untainted by special interest provisions."" (5) PRO has ignored my point that the FT fails to account for the massive transition cost of implementing FT while similarly he has not addressed my explanation on what impact the FT will have on the economy, wages and inflation. He merely talked past it, while maintaining the fiction of revenue neutrality. While I appreciate that tax policy and economic theory are complicated, PRO maintains the fiction that FT is revenue neutral. As I have previously mentioned, what PRO doesn't realize is that FT is only revenue neutral if it achieves (a) 100% compliance for all those kinds of new taxes on things that weren't previously taxed like new houses, labor services, food (in some states), medical care and supplies, government transactions and the like and (b) people spend 100% of their annual incomes -which, as I explained in the previous round, just doesn't happen in all cases because as income rates go up, percentage of consumed income drops -and would probably drop even more because taxes on final sales would disincentivize consumption. (1, 4) It is not enough to say that retail stores already have a means to collect sales tax, where the only sales tax collected presently is at the state level and only on retail goods. FT proposes taxing ALL goods and services, many of which are not presently taxed, and so therefore there is no infrastructure in place to collect them. I don't understand why PRO repeated his point about the 23% vs. 30 %. It's not a reason why we should adopt FT, it's only an explanation of the dichotomy between inclusive and exclusive taxation rates. The fact is that any sales tax like the one PRO proposes would subject those who saved income at a time when income was taxed to double taxation, which he completely ignores. In PRO's world, retirees who saved their income which was subject to taxation would be then subject to taxation on that income again when they spent it. How is this fair? His prebate does not offset the additional burden placed on those who saved when income was taxed directly, rather than under his plan because the prebate does not account for income earned before the FT was implemented. So, it can't be a wash. I also don't understand PRO's responses to my responses on corporations and banking. He just claims I'm wrong, without explaining why while maintaining his warrantless claim that under the FT corporations will ""flock"" to the US. As I previously said, there is no evidence that corporations would come to the United States if the FT were implemented because there is no evidence that the FT would make the US any more desirable to do business. There is likewise no evidence that corporations are shifting out of the United States, as PRO claims, or that, even if they are, that corporations leaving the US was because our present tax policy. Likewise, there is no evidence presented by my opponent that even if some corporations are leaving that the reason for their doing so would be remediated by the FT. The point is that his crying wolf is unsubstantiated, and there are too many holes in his logic for him to win this point. He similarly fails to respond to the possibility that the aggregate economic costs of implementing or transition to the FT, or the new tax regime of the FT itself would make the US a more hostile place to do business altogether when accounting for the impact that FT is going to have (and that my opponent has consistently failed to explain) on prices, wages and inflation. Similarly, he totally ignores my earlier point that there's no reason to think that not only the rich -but everyone- would collectively consume fewer goods and services if a 30% increase was to be leveraged on all goods and services in the US. Rather, there are a whole lot of reasons to assume that economic activity, when consumption is taxed, is going to stagnate whether there's a prebate or not -which is a harm that far outweighs any achievable good PRO's suggested might follow. (1, 2, 4) So, PRO's point about banking holds no water. That impacts both his banking point and his revenue neutrality point because if people are consuming less under the FT, as is predictably the case, then the amount of tax collected is going to be less than under the present regime, and the FT therefore cannot be revenue neutral. Even worse, PRO didn't actually even begin to explain that the prebate, even if it is intended to offset some new taxes in PRO's proposal, does not account for (sometimes widely) divergent costs of living. He even goes so far as to say that ""cost of living can vary from one neighborhood,"" which is even more reason to be profoundly skeptical of his proposal because, as Bartlett (2007) says and which PRO ignores, ""there is essentially no relationship between the rebate and the cost of living or raising children."" (1) Once more, PRO just explained why the rebate would exist under FT, but does not account for divergent costs of living in, say, New York versus Texas. This is especially significant because new houses and rent are taxed at the same rate in both places, but the actual amount of tax paid even for commensurate goods and services is vastly divergent but the prebate is the same across the board. How is this fair? Under FT, both New Yorker and Texan taxpayers get the same proportion of tax rebates paid to them every month -which both does not account for the difference in cost of living between NY and TX and amounts to a universal welfare policy insofar as it grants a literal stipend of cash to everyone without regard to whether they have income of their own or not. But even still, the prebate is still welfare whether PRO wants to acknowledge that or not, because changing the name of monthly distributed cash doesn't change its function. PRO ignored most of the problems with his plan that I pointed out, or misunderstands what I wrote. The problems with his plan are vast: (a) the FairTax creates an entirely new method of collecting taxes without precluding those already in existence while likewise creating entirely new kinds of taxes and entirely new varieties of tax collectors. (4) (b) Where previously the federal government had no means to collect taxes on all sold goods and services, the FT would create an apparatus to do so -and it would create that apparatus without repealing the 16th Amendment. So, Vance (2005) asks, ""what is there to prevent a [federal] income tax from being from being imposed after a national sales tax has been enacted?"" Nothing. (4) (c) Similarly, due to the increased transactional costs the FT would impose on state and local government, it is entirely foreseeable that the FT would actually necessitate states increasing their income tax rates just to achieve revenue neutrality. (1, 4) The FT would therefore not only make it easier for the federal government to raise taxes, but it would also increase the mechanisms at their disposal to tax -while at the same time not eliminating all federal taxes by any measure. We can know this because the FairTax Act makes no mention of repealing the federal excise tax on gasoline nor the federal taxes imposed on numerous other things like airline tickets. (4) All in all, there is no reason to adopt his proposal. Even if you buy his logic and the best case scenario which (myopically) assumes 100% compliance, no one is any better off other than that individuals would not have to not file a federal 1040. His method to that end, however, locates the sole point of tax collection at the level which has the highest rates of evasion and claims that this is going to promote transparency. It just doesn't work. The reality is that his proposal is going to create an unworkable system which imposes double taxation on those who saved when income was directly taxed by the IRS and severely harm the economy in predictable ways (which I explained in earlier rounds that PRO never response to), whose supposed benefits are based on faulty economic logic and whose implications (even if FT's faulty economic logic was valid) impose new taxes and new kinds of taxation in ways that even in the best case demonstrate no aggregate economic improvement from the status quo. Many thanks to PRO. I urge a CON ballot."	CON	55
S9d5a13c2-A79efae34	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	The main effects of requiring a $15 per hour minimum at McDonald's will be to eliminate about half the low-skilled jobs through automation, replace low-skilled workers with higher-skilled workers, and raise food prices to McDonald's customers. Many McDonald's customers cannot well afford the price increases. 1. Labor is now 25% to 35% of fast food costs 80% of McDonald's restaurants are owned by franchisees, not the Corporation. [2. http://tinyurl.com... The parent company makes most of its money through rents and royalties, not by selling food directly. Franchise owners are independent entrepreneurs. The best published detailed estimate is that currently labor costs are 25.3 % of the cost of running a McDonald's franchise. Huffington Post retracted their published estimate that only 17.1% of McDonald's cost were in labor and benefits. [3. http://tinyurl.com... ] Their cited study confused McDonald's Corporation labor with franchise labor, so they used the wrong numbers. [4. http://www.cnbc.com... The current minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, with McDonald’s average about $9. Raising the minimum to $15 per hour would increase operating costs by about 17%.[5. http://tinyurl.com...] Forbes noted that the McDonald's franchising arrangement makes that calculation approximate, so it's probably more. For the fast food industry as a whole, labor costs are about a third of operating costs. [3. op cit] McDonald's is more automated, so their labor costs are a lower percentage. A 20% increase for the industry is a reasonable estimate. The average McDonald's franchised restaurant costs the investor about $2 million and has $2.4 million in yearly sales. [6. http://tinyurl.com...] The net profit margin is about 10%. [7. http://tinyurl.com...] Restaurant sales vary from under $400K to nearly $10 million among restaurant in the chain. Some restaurants are much more profitable than others. 2. Increased costs cannot come out of profits A 17% to 20% increase in costs cannot come out of a 10% profit margin. If profit's drop more than a few points, investors will move capital into alternative ventures. To maintain a 10% return, franchise holders must continually pour in capital to stay competitive. They must buy equipment to make new menu items. They also face strategic risks as the parent company attempts to adapt to long term changes in consumer tastes. [8. http://tinyurl.com...] McDonald's represents 19% of the fast food industry, so there is plenty of competition. Individual owners also risk changes in the fortunes of their location, such as having a competitor open nearby or having the character of the neighborhood change in a way that affects consumer preferences. At much less than 10%, the investment becomes unattractive. 3. A $15 minimum would eliminate about half the jobs If McDonald's could raise prices without hurting sales, they would have already done so. Forbes pointed this out. If everyone's labor costs rise, the chain that uses the least amount of labor will benefit. Customers will also move to lower-margin budget items on the menu, hurting profit margins. [9. http://tinyurl.com...] Customers can also choose to bring their lunch more often, eat out less often, occasionally eat at slightly more upscale restaurants now more of a relative bargain, or purchase machine-made food from a vending machine [10. http://tinyurl.com...]. If the loss of business is too great at a particular location, the unprofitable location is closed. Higher labor costs puts pressure to substitute capital for labor my automating more tasks. That's the main way jobs will be lost. McDonald's took a step towards automating some time ago by installing drink machines that automatically shut off when the cup is full. That automation eliminates one staff position in twelve. They now have machines that automate dispensing the cup and filling it. [11. http://tinyurl.com...] Fast food restaurants have moved drive-through order taking off shore. The drive-through customer speaks to an employee in India or elsewhere, who keys the order into a computer. More than a decade ago, McDonald's built a prototype completely automated restaurant. [12. http://tinyurl.com... (2003)] Customers key in their orders directly into a terminal. Machines then build the order and deliver it by conveyer belt. The Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has a completely automated (one-employee) fast food restaurant operating in Tokyo, where labor costs are high. The level of automation suitable for McDonald's depends upon the labor costs imposed. The bottom line is that jobs are lost. Raising the minimum wage produces no loss only when prevailing wages are already higher than new minimum – not the case for McDonald’s. In general, when the minimum wage increases by 10%, unemployment rises by +2% to +6% [13.Richard Burkhauser, Kenneth Couch et David Wittenberg, “Who Minimum Wage Increases Bite: An Analysis Using Monthly Data from the SIPP and CPS”, Southern Economic Journal, 2000)] Using that rule of thumb, we can expect about half of fast food worker jobs to be lost. The available data on costs and available automated machines confirms the reasonableness of that estimate. Fast food restaurants can immediately replace entry-level employees with more productive employees. Productivity varies considerably. Efficiency varies in taking orders rapidly, performing multiple tasks concurrently, dealing with customers who are hard to understand, and refilling or cleaning the machinery used in the restaurant. At $15, McDonald's can attract more experienced workers. Currently, fast food work is one of the opportunities to learn basic jobs skills. The most basic skill is showing up for work reliably. Other basic skills are dealing with customers, cooperating with co-workers, and taking direction from management. There are work-related skills in preparing the food. Eliminating these jobs harms people just entering the labor force. Youth unemployment, already high, will be made even worse. Fast food work is for entry-level and part-time workers like students or for people who want supplementary income. A spouse might be the primary breadwinner in a household, or an older person might be supplementing retirement income. There are plenty of those people in the work force looking for jobs. 4. Welfare should be done by government insofar as it's done at all If society decides that each person should have a certain minimum income, the government should raise taxes pay for it. That way everyone can see the cost, and the a progressive tax puts more burden on the more wealthy. Artificially increased restaurant prices act in the same way as a tax. Employees are paid more than needed to produce the product, and the extra pay comes from the pockets of the fast food consumers. The “tax” of higher prices is not paid by Donald Trump and Warren Buffett. Rather, the wealth transfer is from the lower part of the wealth spectrum that comprise McDonald customers to the food workers. It is heavily regressive. A welfare state is not a good idea to start with, but a welfare state financed by lower-income consumers is ridiculous. 5. Debate issues Con pleads that Republicans dominate the debate.org site, so he deserves special sympathy. The actual demographics show Democrats outnumber Republicans by 21% to 16%. Minority parties tend to the Left, so it's worse overall. Ideologically, Conservatives plus Libertarians are 27% of members, while Liberals, Progressives, and other leftist ideologies combine to make 33% of the site. [14. http://www.debate.org... ] So no sad violin music for Con. To accurately compare cost numbers from foreign countries, the analysis must include food costs, real estate costs, the nature of the competition, and hidden government subsidies. In making a comparison, the first question is what percentage of the bottom line is in labor costs.	PRO	56
Sdd22a6ba-A99590b5c	Gay marriage should be illegal	"I feel as if this is a battle between L and Lelouch who aren't trying very hard. (Anime reference) Rebuttals: Rebuttals to R1: First, I never claimed that the opposition to gay marriage was made only by religious members of a faith. This is simply not true. I am a monotheist. I do not follow the Bible. I used to be Catholic. I have no religious doctrine telling me to think a certain way. This is my own autonomous decision to uphold the basic moral principals of the country. Con suggesting that the stance against gay marriage is held exclusively by members of a religious faith is ridiculous. From my opponent in round 2: ""Why should we buy the harm principle? First, the government's legitimacy is entirely decided by the harm principle. The government can't be justified at all, except by the sole purpose of helping its people. A government exists to maximize pleasure and minimize pain; its laws are made to ensure that people are happy"" From my opponent in round 3: ""Appeasement isn't sufficient to constitute as ""harm"" for the government to ban something."" Appeasement- to satisfy, allay, or relieve; assuage: (1) Happy- feeling, R03;showing, or causing R03;pleasure or R03;satisfaction: (2) I commend my opponent for his subtlety. However, this contradicts his earlier argument. He conceds that banning gay marriage would make the some people happy. Con then goes on to say that if a person doesn't like it, but it doesn't affect them, it's fine. However, he wants you to forget the examples of where it DOES affect people for the sake of his argument so he can win the debate. Do not let him fool you. The legality of gay marriage has effects on the populus. I have clearly shown how some would be negatively affected by such action. However, again, Con wants you to forget those points and not see the corelation between the two. He then conceds my next point. I extend it. Again, by Con's principals, I have already won the debate. Rebuttal to R2: I don't have much to go over, really. Con rants about how he agrees with my source but that it doesn't apply since he's shown that it doesn't. What he is really doing is trying to buy himself time and character length to make his claims seem valid. I have shown that homosexual love is not equal to homosexual love. I would like to suggest that I have proven that heterosexual love to be superior to homosexual love. I will address my opponent's rebuttals regarding the subject later in the argument. As for his study, I will suggest that it is skewed. The proof is in his own source. ""Significantly compromised health care delivery and adverse health outcomes are well documented for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the United States compared with the population at large. LGBT individuals subject to societal prejudice in a heterosexist world also suffer from the phenomenon known as ""minority stress,"" with its attendant negative mental and physical health effects. Reports in the medical and social science literature suggest that legal and social recognition of same-sex marriage has had positive effects on the health status of this at-risk community. Improved outcomes are to be expected because of the improved access to health care conferred by marriage benefits under federal or state law and as a result of attenuating the effects of institutionalized stigma on a sexual minority group."" This is what I get when I look at his authorship summary. Ladies and gentelman, while I give you sources based on a neutral or economic standpoint, this source is skewed. My point is, there's a difference. As quoted by my source conerning heteronormativity: ""All of these findings obviously demonstrate that men and women need each other. Men without women have no domesticating or moderating influence on their much stronger, testosterone-driven sex drives. And as a result, it is very likely that homosexual males will be prone to the excessive and destructive extremes of their unrestrained sexual appetites. The homosexual male subculture is therefore typically characterized by an astonishing high level of promiscuity with a great number of partners — sometimes high-risk casual, anonymous sexual encounters."" (3) Homosexual love, on average, doesn't last as long. ""Findings were as follows: 100% (all) of the couples experienced infidelity in their relationship within the first 5 years. Couples who remained together past the 10-year mark were able to do so only by accepting the painful reality of infidelity in their relationship More than 85 percent of the couples reported that their greatest relationship problems center on issues related to outside relationships. See 10 Innocent Actions that Can Lead to Infidelity NOTE: Data from the Gay/Lesbian Consumer Online Census shows that only 29% of gay/lesbian relationships last more than 7 years. "" (4) In a study of male homosexuality in Western Sexuality: Practice and Precept in Past and Present Times, M. Pollack found that ""Few homosexual relationships last longer than two years, with many men reporting hundreds of lifetime partners.” (5) Therefore, my definition of discrimination is justified. Gay lovers cheat more often than heterosexual lovers. (3) and don't last as long (4) (5). Rebuttals to R3: Sorry! I didn't see the marriage privatation argument. I will address it now. What Con wants is to change something which isn't even related to this debate. Congress has not considered it. No presidential canidate is for that. (6) What Con is suggesting simply will not happen. However, there are canidates against gay marriage. (7) Therefore, what I'm suggesting may happen. What he is suggesting will not. I will ask my opponent to refer to my argument for facts about the marriage penalty. Again, it shows your sources don't have a basic nowledge of taxation. From my argument: """"The Atlantic authors claim that due to laws favoring married couples, a single peson earning $40,000 a year pays $6,181 in taxes ""Using averages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a single person in his 20s spends about $9,964 on housing where a married couple the same age averages $8,844. Over 60 years this can add up to over $67,200 in savings for a married couple."" ""The same pattern emerges for expenditures on healthcare. Singles spend about $570 per year on healthcare while couples average about $963, which is only $482 per person—far less than their single peers, because of the reduced costs of coverage."" My source later says the following: ""Those calculations do not mention the “marriage penalty,” in which married couples pay more taxes if their newly combined income pushes them into a higher tax bracket"" There you go. The marriage penalty is outweighed by the marriage benefits. It averages all couples together. Those who face the marriage penalty and those who don't. Again, it urges that singles pay more taxes. Con's sources are not valid. I have proved such with this argument. Rebuttal to R4: About to run out of characters. I think I addressed this already. As for it only applying to a certain group, that's like it being a 'women only' night at a club and me complaining I can't get in for free because I have a penis. Or maybe I could claim to be gender fluid and get the SJW to attack the bouncers and let me in.... *Evil Laugh* Rebuttal to R5: 1.) I have addressed why homosexual love is inferior to heterosexual love. I find Con's claims ironic; considering the majority of his case is based on emotional appeal. 2.) This doesn't have to do with the debate; but hey. I disagree and say my sources stand. As for Mark's study, it proves that even with little time with homosexual parents, the kids get messed up. 3.) It's funny since you're the one to make that point now to retract it when you lost it. Refer to ealier arguments. 4.) I have proven there are differences. Refer to earlier arguments. 5.) I would like to argue my studies are valid. However, if you still need more evidence, here you go. (8) What Con fails to comprehend is that one can change environmental and social factors to change their sexuality. I'm out of characters. I would like to end with a quote that Con has ignored: ""It is pointless to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples because male homosexuals, who comprise two-thirds of all homosexuals, have demonstrated that they will not accept monogamy or sexual exclusivity. Marriage [would] have to be redefined not only to include same-sex couples, but also to exclude the element of sexual fidelity. By now it should be clear that gay marriage is motivated more by the desire to destroy the concept of marriage than by “fairness” concerns."" In conclusion: Con has ignored and misrepresented arguments Con has used faulty sources. Con's arguments and faulty; and contradict themselves. I have met my BoP. He has not. Vote Pro!

Sf08ced27-A187291d	Smoking should be banned	"Ok, 1. Pro said about ""The government has right to limit what people do to their bodies"" is silly thing. Like what I said before, this is personal right. Banning smoking may infringe on a person's individual right to behave as he pleases. In addition, basing this prohibition on health reasons may be hypocritical when other substances that may pose similar or greater threats to health, such as alcohol and fattening foods, are allowed. Another reason to oppose the current campaign against smokers is because it violates the legitimate rights of smokers. John Stuart Mill, in a slender book published in 1859 titled On Liberty, wrote: The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. This is the basic premise of libertarianism, the political philosophy of the Founding Fathers. Mill statement is directly applicable to the controversy over smoking. Quite simply, a just government does not have the authority to ban smoking on private property or to tell smokers to quit or to punish them if they do not. Smokers are adults, not children, and they deserve to have their informed choices respected by others. If we pass laws forcing smokers to change their behavior ""for their own good, we need to ask: Where do we stop? Do we pass laws against smoking in private homes? Against frying food indoors (which also releases known carcinogens into the air)? Eating the wrong kinds of food? Eating too much? Weighing too much? Drinking too much (and not just when driving)? Exercising too little? Should we ban other risky behavior, such as skydiving, bungee-jumping, or riding motorcycles? How about drinking more than one cup of coffee each day? So, if government has right to limit what people do to their bodies, directly government will too much interfere. They will limit what food that should we eat maybe worst, government will handle the time to us sleep for our healthy. Can you imagine how suck is that? Pro failed broke my arguments about smoker's rights. 2. Second-hand Smoke Is second-hand smoke a rationale for higher taxes on tobacco or smoking bans? The research used to justify government regulation of second-hand smoke has been powerfully challenged by critics, including Congress own research bureau. According to the EPA, the risk ratio for forty years of exposure to a pack-a-day smoker is just 1.19. Epidemiologists as a rule are skeptical of any relative risks lower than 3 and dismiss as random ratios less than 1.3. An important report on second-smoke appeared in the May 12, 2003 issue of the British Medical Journal. Two epidemiologists, James Enstrom at UCLA and Geoffrey Kabat at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, analyzed data collected by the American Cancer Society from more than 100,000 Californians from 1959 through 1997. ""The results do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, the researchers wrote, although they do not rule out a small effect. ""The association between tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed. ""It is generally considered that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is roughly equivalent to smoking one cigarette per day, according to Enstrom and Kabat. ""If so, a small increase in lung cancer is possible, but the commonly reported 30 percent increase in heart disease risk--the purported cause of almost all the deaths attributed to secondhand smoke -- is highly implausible. 3. Business Smoking bans have had severe negative effects on restaurants, bars, and nightclubs in cities where such bans have been enacted. Smokers choose to stay home or visit with friends who allow smoking in their homes, or spend less time (and less money) in bars and nightclubs before leaving. Smoking bans can also move noisy and potentially dangerous crowds onto sidewalks, and divert police resources from battling more serious crime. Smoking bans violate the private property rights of individuals. The owners of bars, restaurants, and other businesses should be free to decide whether to allow smoking in their establishments and what kinds of accommodations to make for nonsmokers. Their customers should decide how important it is to be able to smoke or to experience a smoke-free environment. People often include smoking to the list of pleasurable activities they enjoy when dining out or visiting a bar. Banning smoking at these establishments may make people less likely to visit, which can hurt the business owners if smokers make up a large percentage of their customers. On the other hand, potential patrons who may have avoided a location because smoking was allowed may now visit a business because of the lack of irritating smoke. 4. Taxing Smokers Cigarettes are already the most heavily taxed commodity in the U.S. The federal excise tax is $1.01 a pack and the national average state excise tax is about $1.36 per pack, for a total of $2.37 per pack. Some cities and states impose far higher taxes. The combined state-local tax rate in Chicago is $6.16 per pack, and in New York City it is $5.85 per pack. Cigarette taxes also are an inefficient and unreliable way to raise funds for government. Excise taxes require relatively high rates to raise funds, creating opportunities and incentives for evasion and the transfer of economic activity to states with lower taxes. Dramatic price hikes and extreme taxes on cigarettes are threatening to create a stampede of tax evasion, black-market transactions, counterfeiting, and even use of lethal violence against convenience store clerks and truck drivers. Recent tax hikes adopted by New York, Cook County, Illinois, and elsewhere threaten to take us to a neoprohibitionist era with all the crime, expenses, and loss of respect for law enforcement that accompanied Prohibition. Excise taxes are also regressive. People with low incomes not only pay a higher percentage of their incomes on cigarette taxes than do wealthier people, they even pay more in absolute terms. Persons earning less than $10,000 paid an average of $81 a year in tobacco taxes, versus $49 for those who make $50,000 or more. This was before recent massive tax hikes! Finally, excise taxes require regular rate increases to keep pace with inflation, whereas income, sales, and property taxes all rise with inflation or economic growth. Because of their narrow bases, excise taxes are unstable revenue generators. 5. Solution In April 2014, the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health published a report summarizing a survey of more than 19,000 past and present users of electronic cigarettes """" the largest survey of its kind to date. Here is what the survey found: Electronic cigarettes helped 81% of the survey respondents quit smoking. Among those who had not quit entirely, one-third were non-daily smokers, and the rest had decreased consumption from 20 cigarettes to 4 per day. Smokers primarily begin using electronic cigarettes for harm reduction and to reduce second-hand smoke exposure to family members. Electronic cigarettes appear to be effective even in highly-dependent smokers. Side effects are minor and reported health benefits are substantial. Unfortunately, some public health organizations and lobbying groups have made a business out of opposing smoking. If electronic cigarettes solve many of the problems that come from smoking tobacco, their """"""business” may be hurt. This conflict of interest means they will be among the last to admit that electronic cigarettes are a safe alternative for smokers. So, government should not banned smoking. If they worry about people healthy, smoker can choose to use electronic cigarettes. But still,government can't force them to stop smoking. That is their right to choose."	CON	58
S5d12ad-Af7358a4e	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"QUESTIONS 2. ""The prison system of the united states separates criminals based on the severity of their crimes.[1] This means the 10% of criminals who have longer sentences, will generally be sent to different prison than the white collar criminals."" It seems my opponent is associating the 'out in a year' people with white collar criminals, which is not necessarily true. However he does inadvertently raise the point that the 10% and 90% could be separated, and he uses a source to back up this idea of separation (he posted it in the comments, fyi). Two things about the source, first, it is a wiki, which is ironic given that my opponent criticized me earlier for faulty sources. However I accept the source, as it undermines the point he raises. While he never specifies where in the source he draws this information from (also ironic, as I have seen him criticize other debaters for this practice), I believe I have found where, under 'security levels'. ""In various, but not all, states' department of corrections, inmates reside in different facilities that vary by security level..""[1] What this means? In some instances, the 90% are perfectly liable to be raped by those who have been in for a while. Therefore my contention of AIDS being spread back to society holds, though it is slightly diminished. C. I understood you, I was saying that the validity of your third contention relied on the validity of your second contention, which I'd already refuted. (not super-important but I just wanted to clarify) DISAGREEMENTS ""Would like to note the realistic approach my opponent takes here, while in a few paragraphs states the argument is hypothetical."" I didn't say hypothetical, I said could and should. By showing the costs of treating AIDS, or as you put it, 'being realistic', I showed that this 'should' be implemented, due to the fact that released prisoners are often in a bad way, economically. A. ""While I do believe that AIDS*(or any disease) is a heavy financial burden, it's not relevant in that regard as a ""death sentence"" for that is primarily a healthcare issue."" It is of course relevant. It means that unless you're wealthy, AIDS is going to take your life earlier than it would otherwise end. You don't have to call it a 'death sentence' if you want, but we all have to recognize that a recently released prisoner with AIDS is not likely to survive. PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL In my previous round, I made an argument for why this wouldn't actually be hypocritical, and then I made an argument for anyone who still thought it was hypocritical. My opponent has not addressed that argument, and simply restated his earlier contention. Therefore, voters can consider that argument dropped. As for the Native Americans and African Americans, my opponent waives away my argument saying 'cultural differences' and 'affirmative action was a thing'. True, it was a thing, and still is, but it's not just for black people, it's for all minorities[1]. So really, it's like saying Native Americans: 2, African Americans: 1. Additioanlly, the 'cultural' differences don't change the fact that both minorities have been mistreated, but only one compensated with tax breaks. Therefore my earlier point about hypocrisy with Native American tax breaks is preferable to nobody having tax breaks still stands. ""Do you know how much distrust that would generate with the people? With the prisoners?"" I believe that as long as the government very clearly explained why this wouldn't be hypocritical, like I have, then there wouldn't be any issue. And even if some people still thought it was BS, is that enough to stop this? Is that what you say to someone who's getting raped hundreds of times a year in prison, ""Sorry we didn't want to upset people""? COST AND REALISTIC APPROACH ""For instance, we SHOULD give Americans the best healthcare possible for free and stop everyone from ever committing a crime again. But can we do that? No."" True, but we can stop the spread and death toll of AIDS, and stop massive amounts of prison rape. There isn't a solid parallel between the example offered by my opponent and the proposition at hand. 1. Spending A) ""It would benefit more people and people of better societal standing to spend that money in other areas."" What, $5 a year? I chose that number because it would hardly make a dent in anyone's pocketbook. Everyone would still be free to donate to their favorite charity, or support their local businesses. B&C ) Both of the contentions found here are repeated in different sections, therefore I won't be rebutting these. D) ""..government sponsored prostitutes. Would never fly."" Would is pretty much the same word as could, especially in this instance. This gets back to could and should, and what is right. Just because it would be hard or unpopular, does not mean it shouldn't be tried. 2. Society and politics A&B) So is that what we're going to tell the people getting raped? Sorry, the politicians were afraid to stop you from getting raped. Again, all they would have to do, in order to get some people on their side, is argue and defend their position as I have. THE PROBLEM SOLVED 1. In my opponent's first contention, he contradicts himself. First, he says rape goes deeper than loneliness, then he says masturbating will be enough to cure the loneliness and stop the rape. I agree that rape goes deeper than loneliness, but, and this is the important part, I think it goes deeper than that in cases outside of prison. I say this because the situations in and outside of prison are very different, and so are the rape rates. Outside of jail, the rape rate is 286 per 100,000[2], whereas the rape rate inside jail is 5,000 per 100,000[3][and previous source]. This would suggest that the added feature of extreme loneliness is what forces such a high rate in jail. I say this because of the following: On the outside you've got those creeps that are interested in feeling more powerful than their victim, and we see the kind of numbers they rack up. But in jail, the number is much higher, and there's the difference that they spend many years alone from the opposite sex. Logically, this added factor will then play a large hand in the increase of rapes. This loneliness has led to a culture that is very comfortable with rape as a necessary thing, adding to its widespread occurrence. Prostitution would wipe out that loneliness and that necessity. MORE 'FLAWS' 1. ""If a prisoner has AIDS, he would not get a prostitute, and keep on raping."" Already refuted. ""If you could test and give him an AIDS infected prostitute, why not just have timed test for AIDS and separate the AIDS prisoners from everyone else?"" Because this would not solve the problem of rape. 2. ""You'd need at least 1 for every 2-3 prisoners to not get a high infection rate."" Not sure where you pulled this number from, I'm pretty sure you have nothing to substantiate this claim with. 3. ""The amount of pay you'd need to support a prostitute for getting infected with STD's and if she sued, would be ridiculous."" Make her sign a waiver before she takes the job. 4. ""General cost of lodging, food, and pay for a prostitute would be more than a prisoner's cost."" You seem to be operating under the assumption that the prostitutes will be living in the prison. That would not be the case. I told you that if you had any further questions about my proposal, that you should ask before joining. Any confusion that arises out of your not doing that is your fault. 5. Again, just explain this stuff to people. If society gets riled up with the idea you're suggesting, just know that it is to prevent rape and deaths related to AIDS, and it will lower the recidivism rates. 6. ""What about gay men or women?"" Gay prostitutes are a thing. And if you mean, will this deter them from raping, of course it will. Would you rather have sex with someone who is resisting or not into it, or someone whose job depends on being good at sex? 7. ""What about those who deny the prostitutes? Would they be forced?"" No[4]. THE CASE FOR WHY NOT This section was just my opponent restating his earlier arguments, which have already been refuted, therefore I have nothing to say here. PROOF HE'S REQUESTING 1. ""That ""handlers"" would stop abuse of prostitutes or not abuse them."" A prisoner would not abuse because they wouldn't want to lose their special privilege. If a handler abused, it could be reported to someone else. 2. Already refuted. 3. No clue. But I have shown that there are some very simple ways to raise funds, and I have already mentioned that instead of covering all the jails/prisons in America, they could just prioritize on a few if it came to that. IN CONCLUSION I encourage you vote for me, because: I have shown rape would be reduced by the implementation of this. I have shown that it would make the lives of prostitutes better. I have shown that it would reduce the spread and death toll of AIDS. I have used far more, and far more reliable sources than my opponent, who only utilized a wiki, which he only ever put in the comments. My opponent has been very arrogant and condescending throughout the debate. Thanks for reading. Vote Pro. Sources: [1] https://www.aclu.org... [2] http://americanprogress.org...

Sf08ced27-Aac7e90c5	Smoking should be banned	"Thanks to Rizkaa for responding! Here, I will attempt to refute Con's arguments and put forward my own. 1. People who do not want second hand smoke should just not go to places where smoking is allowed Con argues that people should not go to places if they do not want to get second hand smoke. However, if smoking is allowed in public, there will be little places that they can go because there are so many smokers. My argument, argument 2, still stands. Con's argument is also based on the idea that adults are allowed to harm themselves, as long as they don't harm others. I have proved that smoking harms others in my previous round, and forcing people who do not want to suffer from second hand smoke to either put up with it or avoid going to a lot of places actually reduces rather than increases rights. 2. Ventilation can remove most of the smoke Ventilation is, in fact, ineffective in removing harmful gases caused by tobacco smoking. (http://www.cdc.gov...) 3. Economic impact Con claims that establishments such as bars and restaurants will get reduced profits if a smoking ban takes place. However, this is not the case: restaurant profits stayed the same, and pub profits dipped slightly but increased in the long run. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...) This proves that economic issues do not result from smoking bans. 4. Personal right I have debunked the ""freedom of choice"" argument before in the last round: smoking affects non-smokers, and the government does have the right to make certain drugs illegal. Con argues that because some other substances are more harmful than smoking, smoking should not be banned. This is a red herring: just because one is worse than another does not mean that the less harmful one is not an issue. Also, as stated in the previous round, marijuana is less harmful than smoking in terms of death rates but is banned: this shows that, according to con's logic, smoking should be banned, too. 5. Difficulty of implementation - Though a smoking ban may seem like a brilliant idea to control the potential dangers, it is not always easy to implement at all places. However, the difficulty of implementation does not mean that implementing something is wrong: abolishing slavery was difficult, but that did not mean it was wrong. - Also, if it is a small or a new business, it may not afford to lose its clients because of the ban. After all, it all about survival. In such cases, the ban loses its purpose. I have proved above that smoking bans had little to no impact on restaurant and pub revenues: in fact, pub revenues rose after the small dip caused by the smoking ban. Conclusion I would like to thank con for putting effort into his well thought out arguments. I believe that I had proven that smoking is harmful, that ""personal rights"" is not a valid objection to smoking bans, and that con's concerns are invalid. I believe that con has left some of my arguments, such as my argument about personal rights, inadequately addressed. I believe that I have adequately proven my case for this round."	PRO	60
Sf08ced27-Aec794a87	Smoking should be banned	"Personal Right Con said that ""The problem is these only affect the people who do the actions"", I already talk about it in the 2nd round. Everyone as human has right to choose what they want to do. This is personal right. Con said ""Banning smoking may infringe on a person's individual right to behave as he pleases. In addition, basing this prohibition on health reasons may be hypocritical when other substances that may pose similar or greater threats to health, such as alcohol and fattening foods, are allowed. It is a silly thing. I mean, if con want to not infringe on other people rights, Government can make a law for smokers to smoking in a special room NOT banned smoking. With this, government can protect smoker rights and other people rights. So, from the 1st round until 3rd round, he just make a problem that government can solve it this problem with other way with not adverse one party. Government should fair to make a decision. Even, The World Health Organization""s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) formally classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic (PDF). ""The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances,"" the IARC""s Kurt Straif told the South China Morning Post. ""We consider this to be the most important environmental carcinogen, more so than passive smoking."" http://www.businessweek.com... Con said that ""marijuana is less harmful than smoking"" But con said before ""The government should keep people from harm. In the fact, marijuana is also harm. Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the only way to fully protect non smokers from secondhand smoke exposure. Separating smokers from nonsmokers within the same air space, cleaning the air, opening windows, and ventilating buildings does not eliminate secondhand smoke exposure. So, if government should keep people from harm : marijuana, vehicle, alcohol and more should be banned. Not only smoking. But, you know that is so illogical. So, con failed to break my argument about personal right and it's also answered about second hand smoke. 2. About Business and Taxing, I already explain this very clearly that based on the fact in the 2nd round. I think here, con ignores my argument that based on the fact. We can""t close our eyes that banned smoking give bad influence for economy impact. So, my argument about business and taxing are very clearly and con failed break my argument. So many way to protect people non smoker rights without decrease smoker rights. Government can make regulation about special room for smoker. So, ""banned smoking"" is bad idea. Whereas, smoke has important place In economy impact and this is personal right. Thank you."	CON	61
S5d12ad-Af939c0ae	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"My opponent is new to this site, and I was not extremely clear in my instructions, so please do not give me 7 points automatically for his deviation from the debate structure. Generally when someone says that the second round is for opening arguments, that means to post your own reasons without addressing the ones your opponent presented in the same round. MY OPPONENT QUESTIONS.. 1. The legitimacy of my statistic showing that 90% of prisoners are out in a year. While I think my source is just fine, I'm not going to sit back and assume everyone else will be. Though I was unable to find the activists who made the statement, I found what we should all be able to agree is a more reputable source, that supports, if not the the statistic, the spirit of the statistic. We can see that the average time spent in jail overall is hovering a little under 3 years[1]. I think we can see that the original statistic is either true or close to true, as the 10% would be spending a lot of time, and thus raise the average somewhat. And even if that isn't quite the case, and, for instance, 90% got out in 1 and a half or 2, my point still stands. 2. A) My opponent says the topic is not in relation to the topic without addressing my reasoning for why it is. It is relevant because it shows that we're sending out prisoners who could've acquired AIDS due to widespread prison rape at a rapid rate. B) My opponent claims that there is no connection to support the idea that the 10% would rape the 90%. I believe there is a very clear connection, that being excessive loneliness. The 10% would've spent a lot of time in jail. Keep in mind also that those among the 90% could be frequent offenders, who keep getting shuffled in and out of jail. C) Here my opponent says that we can assume rape wouldn't happen in under a year, and I'm assuming he means new inmate on new inmate rape. This contention is based on the validity of contention B), which I have already refuted, therefore, I have nothing to say for this one. 3. My opponent says he could argue that my sources are improperly linked, but then says he won't, therefore this isn't something I really need to refute. MY OPPONENT DISAGREES.. 1. A) My opponent says that AIDS is no longer a death sentence, though it is not curable. I assume he refers to the treatments that can allow one to live a normal life. The problem with this contention is that the yearly costs for AIDS treatment is over $23,000[2]. Even if you were a median earner of income in the US, making roughly $51,000[3], this would be an extremely burdensome cost. After all, it's not as if the average person gets to the end of the year with half their income unspent. But we're not even talking about your average American, we're talking about prisoners. As far as employment goes, things look much bleaker for any recently released prisoners. To quote the Urban Institute, ""Eight months after prison, 65 percent of respondents had been employed at some point, but only 45 percent were currently employed. ""[4] ""Most respondents relied on family and friends for income after release, more so than legal employment.""[4] Additionally, only 52% of released prisoners have a high school diploma or GED[4]. All of this information factors into the contention that AIDS is not a death sentence. Clearly it is, if you're in the economic position that recently released prisoners are. We can see that few are holding steady jobs, most are relying on their family and friends for economic help, and most lack the education necessary to get anywhere in life. The average non-diploma holder earns $25,000 a year[5][6][7], and the average diploma holder $33,000[5][6][7]. Compare those incomes to $23,000 a year for treatment, and you can see that the odds of AIDS being a death sentence for these people is quite high. B) My opponent states, correctly, that the US Prison system does not give the prisoners AIDS themselves. This is, I assume, in reference to the part of my opening where I talked about ignoring/condoning the rape. I don't think it would be necessary for my opponent and I to argue who's condoning what, as whoever wins that argument hasn't helped themselves in arguing towards the resolution. Therefore I won't be rebutting this, or C and D, as they're along the same thread. PROSTITUTION IS ILLEGAL My opponent claims that this proposition is hypocritical, and therefore shouldn't be implemented. My response is two-fold. First, differing motivations remove hypocritical nature of acts. Prostitution is outlawed in the interests of keeping people safe (whether or not it does that is an entirely different debate, of course), and this prostitution would legalize prostitution in prisons in the interests of overall safety. If the motivations were along the lines of, ""Normal citizens can't have sex with prostitutes but prisoners can just because"", then there would be hypocrisy. However, this is not the reasoning behind this proposal, and it is therefore not hypocritical. Second, assuming it were hypocritical for the sake of those unconvinced by the above refutation, hypocrisy does not necessarily mean an act is wrong. For instance, this act would prevent rape. Your thinking the use of prostitutes in jail does not change this fact. It does not change the fact that it is doing something good, even if it appears hypocritical. As an example, look at the case of Native America tribes and African Americans. Native Americans get special tax exemptions[8], but black people do not. Why not? Both groups have been severely mistreated by the US Government in the past, why is it that only one of them is getting compensative treatment? I don't know, but I would ask you, just because it's hypocritical to withhold tax exemptions from black people whilst giving them to Native Americans, would you then say the Native Americans should lose their exemptions? No, of course not. It might be a hypocritical situation, but that doesn't mean you should make the situation worse for the NA. The same could be said for my proposition, assuming it were hypocritical. Just because you think the situation is hypocritical, doesn't mean you should make the situation worse for the prisoners and prostitutes who could benefit. COST AND REALISTIC APPROACH My opponent's contention here is that A) this would be too expensive, and B) it would never become a law in reality. My rebuttal is pretty short here. This debate is about whether or not we 'should' implement this proposition, not if we 'could'. Part A of this contention applies in part to 'should', but whether or not politicians would have the balls to even touch this idea is not related to 'should'. So, for the cost, there are many solutions. Off the top of my head, I see two great ways to raise funds for this undertaking. First, trim a little of military spending. This year (2014), the military spending will be at $526 billion[9]. It is planned to rise. It wouldn't be too great of an issue to take out one or two of those many, many billions to help fund this proposition, no? Or, we could put some kind of tax on all Americans. If we levied a $5 tax on all Americans we could raise $1.585 billion[10][7] to help prevent rape and provide a safer line of work for prostitutes. Or we could do a bit of both. There's plenty of creative ways to provide funds for this proposition. Additionally, remember that the gov't won't be shouldering all of the cost, the prisoners will be subsidizing this in part with the money they pay for the prostitute, even if the money they pay doesn't come out to a profit for the government. THE PROBLEM, 'SOLVED' 1. Masturbation is not the same as sex, even if there are 'tools' involved. Perhaps this would reduce rape to a certain degree, but we can safely assume these guys have been masturbating a lot before turning to someone outside their usual sexual preference. Therefore, if we really want to reduce this pandemic in a significant way, I recommend sticking with my proposition. 2. 'Make a better system' is a lot simpler to say than do. I recommend we try to do both. Try to make the situation better for prostitutes, but also follow through with my proposition. Unless the situation is improved so significantly that we run out of prostitutes for my proposition, we can do both, and improve the situation in both categories. THE PROSTITUTES THEMSELVES 1. My opponent says here that the prostitutes would be abused, ignoring my rationale for why they wouldn't be. I'm running out of characters, so I will not be re-stating why prostitutes would be very safe in jail, and why it's preferable to them being out on the streets with their pimps and clients. 2. My opponent says that prostitutes wouldn't want to take this job. Same rebuttal as part 1 of this section. 3. My opponent says the prostitutes would likely go to white-collar prisoners, and therefore wouldn't really be targeting the issue of rape. Nowhere in my proposition did I say this would be the case. I have already said that this would be aimed at all prisons, and failing that, prisons with high incidences of rape. Sources: [1] http://www.pewtrusts.org... [2] http://www.cdc.gov...

Sdd22a6ba-A9e4db8ed	Gay marriage should be illegal	"Konbanwa! Today, we will not only be arguing the morality of gay marriage. We will be arguing many key facts that gay marriage would put on this country. Case 1: Gay Marriage Will Cost The Government Money You may be perplexed by this statement at first. However, let me elaborate. Married couples get many exemptions from taxes and benefits by being married. In this argument, we will briefly go over said exemptions and benefits enjoyed by married couples. Estate Tax: In a normal situation, an estate tax will be deducted when a loved one gives a property to whoever they choose. An estate tax would apply to single men and women across the country. However, married couples have what is called an ""estate tax marital deduction"". With said deductions, the government could lose millions of dollars of potential profit. As the article explains: ""Estate taxes are a concern for all filers, but the good news is that the Internal Revenue Code exempts millions of dollars of assets from this tax. The better news for married couples is that they don't have to worry about limits. You can leave an estate worth any amount to your spouse and, thanks to what is known as the estate tax marital deduction, there are no federal estate taxes to pay."" (1) Although the spouse isn't tax free, this code defers many oppurtunities for potential taxation. Home Sales Tax: A home sales tax is a taxation that occurs when an individual decides they would like to sell their property. Married couples can get a tax break twice the size of their single counterparts. A married couple can receieve a $500,000 tax break when a singe individual can only get a $250,000 tax break. This will cost the government money. (1) Marriage Bonus: This taxation can be a double edged sword. If the people in the marriage make around the same, they will receieve a tax penalty. If the people in the marriage make significantly less or more than their partner, they receieve a tax bonus. As quoted by the article: ""Some couples still could face a bit of marriage penalty. This occurs when their combined earnings push them into the four higher brackets (25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent), where the income amounts are not strictly doubled. And some couples actually enjoy a marriage bonus. This is often the case when there is a large difference between a husband's and wife's incomes."" (1) ""While O’Brien doesn’t advise anyone to seek out a partner specifically because he or she has a business that’s losing money, it's worth noting that the negative numbers of one person in a marriage can help both spouses. The spouse who’s losing money may not take advantage of some deductions, including those dealing with the house, but the spouse who’s making money may use the loss as a tax write-off. “This is also true of high medical expenses,” O’Brien said."" (2) We are over 19 trillion dollars in debt! Trilions! We need this taxation! (3) Conclusions To Case 1: The USA is 19 trillion dollars in debt. Marriage cost the government money. Gay marriage means less taxation; which harms our econemy. Case 2: Marriage Isn't A Right This argument will be quoted by source number four. (4) "" Every person who claims that the denial of the ability to marry is unconstitutional is misguided. Getting married isn't a right. Marriage is a civil institution that all societies in history have recognized and used as the best way to legitimize, protect and raise children as well as to solidify familial and political connections. Second, the North Carolina law doesn't unfairly deny anyone of the ability to marry. The law — and others like it — defines and recognizes marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It doesn't exclude anyone from marrying. The law treats a heterosexual person the exact same way it treats a homosexual person, with both prohibited from marrying a person of the same sex. Traditional marriage laws simply define what constitutes a married couple. The laws are extended equally — regardless of sexual preference. So the right that homosexual marriage proponents claim exists really does not. There is no right to marry someone of the same sex. The ability for a person to marry someone of the same sex is equally denied to everyone. Another claim that is offered in defense of homosexual marriage is that consenting adults should be allowed to marry whomever they love. But at what point is it alright to arbitrarily move the discriminatory lines of demarcation, and how is it justified? If it's acceptable for homosexuals to marry each other because of love and consent, then why is polygamy illegal when the parties involved are similarly in love and consenting? What about aunts and nephews or uncles and nieces when the same standards are present? If it is discrimination against homosexuals, why would it not be discrimination against these other parties? Lastly, homosexual marriage advocates claim that legalizing homosexual marriage is a civil rights issue — equating it with the struggle to legalize interracial marriages of the past. The attempt to correlate race with sexual preferences doesn't hold up when properly scrutinized. Legalizing interracial marriages fulfilled the legal requirement of marriage between a man and a woman because there's no difference between a white man and a black man or a white woman and a black woman. But there are enormous differences between a man and a woman, which is why there are separate bathrooms for men and women. It's why there is an NBA and an WNBA and an PGA and an LPGA. In all the aforementioned sporting leagues, there is a logical separation by gender while races and ethnicities are not classified. Race doesn't matter. Gender does. The emotional desire to legalize homosexual marriage is understandable, but to do so would be to change the law for a specific group of people. That's really discrimination."" Case 3: Morality of Gay Marriage ""Redefining marriage would further distance marriage from the needs of children and deny the importance of mothers and fathers. It would deny, as a matter of policy, the ideal that children need a mother and a father. Redefining marriage would diminish the social pressures and incentives for husbands to remain with their wives and their biological children and for men and women to marry before having children. The concern is not so much that a handful of gay or lesbian couples would be raising children but that it would be very difficult for the law to send a message that fathers matter when it has redefined marriage to make fathers optional. In recent decades, marriage has been weakened by a revisionist view that marriage is more about adults’ desires than children’s needs. This view reduces marriage primarily to emotional bonds or legal privileges. Redefining marriage represents the culmination of this revisionism and would leave emotional intensity as the only thing that sets marriage apart from other bonds. However, if marriage were just intense emotional regard, marital norms would make no sense as a principled matter. There is no reason of principle that requires an emotional union to be permanent. Or limited to two persons. Or sexual, much less sexually exclusive (as opposed to “open”). Or inherently oriented to family life and shaped by its demands. In other words, if sexual complementarity is optional for marriage, then almost every other norm that sets marriage apart is optional.[10] Redefining marriage marginalizes those with traditional views and leads to the erosion of religious liberty. The law and culture will seek to eradicate such views through economic, social, and legal pressure. If marriage is redefined, believing what virtually every human society once believed about marriage—that it is a union of a man and woman ordered to procreation and family life—would be seen increasingly as a malicious prejudice to be driven to the margins of culture. The consequences for religious believers are becoming apparent.[11] For example, after Massachusetts redefined marriage to include same-sex relationships, Catholic Charities of Boston was forced to discontinue its adoption services rather than place children with same-sex couples against its principles. Massachusetts public schools began teaching grade-school students about same-sex marriage, defending their decision because they are “committed to teaching about the world they live in, and in Massachusetts same-sex marriage is legal.” A Massachusetts appellate court ruled that parents have no right to exempt their children from these classes.[12]"" (5) Homosexuals, on average, are not faithful to their significant other as often as homosexuals. In lament's terms, homosexuals cheat more. ""New research at San Francisco State University reveals just how common open relationships are among gay men and lesbians in the Bay Area. The Gay Couples Study has followed 556 male couples for three years — about 50 percent of those surveyed have sex outside their relationships, with the knowledge and approval of their partners. It is pointless to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples because male homosexuals, who comprise two-thirds of all homosexuals, have demonstrated that they will not accept monogamy or sexual exclusivity. Marriage [would] have to be redefined not only to include same-sex couples, but also to exclude the element of sexual fidelity. By now it should be clear that gay marriage is motivated more by the desire to destroy the concept of marriage than by “fairness” concerns."" Dumb character limit!

S14e017ba-A3a008946	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Thanks for the debate Contra. == Smart Cards == Face it, these are just not going to happen in the US, for the same reason a national ID card didn't happen: the ACLU and other privacy groups completely oppose a government database that can track us. Groups have expressed concerns that a national health database could be used for employment discrimination (against sick people). Regardless, the smart cards in Taiwan didn't stop overutilization of health care given the evidence I cited that they are nearing bankruptcy and are being forced to borrow from private banks to prop up their single-payer system. == Private is better than public == My opponent cites a 2002 study showing that slightly more Medicare recipients were satisfied with their health care. Firstly, it is noteworthy that the same study found much lower rates of satisfaction with Medicaid compared to private insurance. [1] Given that Medicare for all would be unaffordable, single payer in the US seems more likely to resemble Medicaid. Secondly, this study was conducted a decade ago. It even found that there was worry among those surveyed that benefits would be cut in the future – which is precisely what has and will happen. My opponent never answers the evidence that the government cut reimbursement rates by 21% recently, leading to a projected 34% of all doctors and 62% of all primary care physicians refusing to take Medicare patients (according to the AMA). Price controls have recently caused massive shortages in 178 drugs for Medicare patients. And regardless, Medicare spending is not sustainable. ""By 2020, Medicare deficits will claim one in every five federal tax dollars that are not already dedicated to Medicare and Social Security."" [2] This means that Medicare alone will take up 40% of our federal budget by 2020 since 20% of the budget already goes to Medicare/Medicaid. If we gave Medicare to everyone, the system would bankrupt us pretty quickly. The only reason Medicare works now is the many (labor force participants) pay for the few (retired people). If the many pay for the many, the system wouldn't work. It's far too expensive. Obama's health care reform ensures that people will no longer be uninsured by providing government subsidies and state insurance pools to help people afford *private* insurance. This private sector solution is preferable. == Drug innovation == While Canada may have been one of the first countries to switch to laparoscopic gallbladder removal, laparoscopic surgery was first patented in 1972 in the United States and the first laparoscopic surgery equipment was made by Ven Instruments in Buffalo, New York. [3] While I don't doubt that doctors in public research institutions will find new surgical techniques, I do doubt that drug companies will continue investing billions of dollars in drug research when government price controls ensure that those investments will not pay dividends. That's why a study found that countries with single payer price controls lose $22 billion per year in research from their pharmaceutical industries resulting in 13 fewer drugs being invented each year. According to Professor Robert Barro of Harvard University, price controls in Canada mean that Canada utterly relies on the US pharmaceutical industry to invent new drugs for it. [4] If we adopt single payer as well, new drugs will be invented at a snail's pace. == Funding == Auto workers in the US have amazing health insurance; that says more about the strength of their unions (and the lack of unions in Japan) than about public vs. private insurance. My opponent never proves that a 7% tax on employers is sufficient to cover the cost of insuring everyone. Employers only pay about 7.5% now for private health insurance. [5] People in France pay 20% of their incomes for their health care system and a projection for the US found that the average family needs to pay $14,000 per year in taxes to support a single-payer system. People would also be really angry to lose their employer-provided private insurance. In France, their health care is ranked #1 because people still receive supplementary private insurance through their employers to cover everything that the government refuses to provide. == Preventative care == My opponent drops the CBO analysis that preventative care will raise – not lower – costs as many healthy people start overusing it. == Other nations are better == My opponent drops the Forbes analysis that life expectancy, which includes car accidents, homicides, obesity, etc, is not a good measure of the quality of a health care system. If you measure from the point of intervention (once people get sick), the US ranks #1 on five year survival rates. == Medicare bureaucracy == Paul Krugman, who writes his opinions in an op-ed for the New York Times on a range of issues on which he is not qualified to speak, is merely referencing the flawed statistics my opponent already cited. Krugman has been in hot water before for using flawed statistics in his op-ed. The Heritage Foundation found that Medicare has nearly 50% higher administrative costs than private insurance on a per person basis. Doctors agree that Medicare bureaucracy is overly burdensome, which is one of the top reasons they are dropping Medicare patients (second only to the abysmally low reimbursement rates). In contrast, private insurance overhead will only go down now that Obama has mandated that 85% of insurance money go to medical care. == Doctors would quit == My opponent has no response to the poll showing that 20% of doctors would quit under single payer due to low pay. It doesn't matter if some doctors would be happier, 20% would quit. This would lead to serious quality of care issues. Plus, more than 20% of potential medical students would instead seek other professions. Doctors in France earn two thirds less than those in the US. Average pay obviously determines the number of students in a particular field. At best, the number of MD students doesn't decline, but the quality of students becomes atrocious. My opponent concedes that France has severe shortages in doctors in 19 of 22 regions of their country. == Wait lists == This is an easy win for me. My opponent's only response in the last round is to cite some random guy in Canada who thinks there are no wait lists. I cited studies showing: 50% of people in Sweden wait more than 3 months for surgery; 21% of cancer patients in England die while on the wait list, which is why the WHO calls England a deliverer of ""third world cancer care""; only half of ER patients in Canada are treated in a timely manner, according to international medical standards; in Canada, the wait time for emergency heart surgery is 65 days and for breast cancer treatment is 168 days. In such a world, it's pretty easy for the US to be ranked #1 in 5 year survival rates for cancer. In addition, I cite evidence from Canada and Japan showing that the rich and well-connected can jump the wait list. I cite evidence that the poor in Canada have worse health outcomes than the poor in the US. And I cite evidence that the health of the poor in England has not improved since they implemented single-payer insurance in 1948. Access to a wait list is not access to health care. == Death Panels == The government often doesn't cover many treatments people need, which is why people in France all buy supplementary private insurance (in addition to paying 20% of their incomes for government insurance). == Conclusion == Single payer means you would have to pay $14,000 a year for access to a government wait list. If you needed care, you would likely die waiting. Government price controls would mean that all the new cancer drugs being invented currently in the US would not be invented and that there would be shortages in generic drugs as well. We would lose a substantial number of our doctors and the best and brightest would start choosing other professions. The poor would not be any better off, empirically. The rich are stuck paying for government insurance they don't want and would need to continue buying private insurance. More health care spending would go to government bureaucracy rather than to medical treatments. In fact, 25 cents of every dollar now spent on private medical care would instead go to government bureaucracy (50% higher bureaucratic costs). Under current entitlements, the government will already consume 60 cents of every dollar produced in the US by 2050. [6] With France as our guide, adding free health care for all would mean that government spending in 2050 will be at 100% of GDP. Single payer will not only bankrupt our nation, but it will quickly topple us from atop our pedestal as the best health care system in the world in regards to 5 year survival rates. Obama's private sector solution for providing universal coverage is clearly preferable."	CON	64
S22d02825-A193eb2c5	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"I thank my opponent for responding to my last argument. However, I do believe that some of his responses were inadequate. For a number of my arguments made in my past post, my opponent simply responded by asking for a source. I understand the importance of sources in a debate. However, there are times when sources needn't to be cited. For well known facts, a source is not always necessary. For example, would I need to cite a source to claim ""a Health Care Reform Bill was passed in 2010"". Even though sources could be cited, it would be a waste of time to try to prove this point. Having said that, I will defend all of the statements that I made that my opponent mentioned: a. ""the huge amount of revenue expected to come from tax increases on the rich will certainly not all materialize."" This is not a particularly controversial statement among economists (although, the extent to which it is true is). Basically, the tax increases in the bill increase tax rates for the rich. These higher tax rates increase an additional disincentive to earn income on top of the tax rates that already exist. That means that the reward of earning income at the top is reduced and the incentive to dodge taxes is increased, therefore less income is earned. This means that, while taxes increase, the tax base decreases. This means that less income is taxed, but at a higher rate. Therefore, more revenue is raised, but not as much as projected. This is a fairly solid theory, but the near unanimous support for this idea in empirical literature should quell all doubt. Even liberal economists acknowledge that this effect doest exist to a degree. At the bottom, I cite an article by Economist Alan Reynolds explaining this in depth, and giving the numerous estimates for just how much High Income people reduce their income in response to higher tax rates. Generally, empirical research has found that there is a large response. b. ""Talking about Medicare savings in a campaign is much easier than actually making cuts in practice."" The Medicare Savings are largely based on cuts to provider reimbursement rates. If these come to fruition, they will lead to Doctors rejecting Medicare patients at Similar rates to Medicaid Patients. However, they will likely not come into place. Even though the bill relies on these savings, Congress has already extended the well known Doc Fix outside of the Bill. Other savings are not into law. Instead, they appointed a board, known as IPAB, to install cost controls. This board can only make recommendations to Congress, which will likely reject politically unpopular proposals. c. ""There will be pages of new regulations and forms, making it harder to start a new business."" This is not a claim that should require a source. The fact that the bill is long (2,700 pages long) and that it includes many regulations should be a simple enough statement to not require a source to be cited. There are many new regulations in this bill. These include an employer mandate for larger businesses, making it more expensive to expand and start new businesses. There are also numerous forms and complications in the bill that make owning a business far more complicated. Although I don't believe these simple claims require a source, I will cite a source to support these claims. d. ""On top of this, there a number of surcharges on Insurance Companies in the Health Care Reform Bill, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices."" Again, my opponent simply responded by asking for a source. This is not a particularly controversial claim. It is a simple fact that these are included in the Health Care Bill. Therefore, I did not think a source was particularly necessary. Surcharges on Health Insurance Companies are part of the increased revenue used to pay for the bill. Again, I will link to a source here at the bottom. e. ""the bill also includes large tax increases that will hit a significant number of Small Businesses."" Again, it is a fairly well known fact that the Health Care Bill is largely funded by tax increases aimed at individuals making over $250,000 a year. A large number of these individuals are Small Business Owners. Again, I'm not exactly sure why a fact that is this well known need a source. f. ""Medicaid Patients do not get much better access to Health Care than uninsured patients. Likewise, the bill will lead to much larger Health Care wait times"" I disagree with the point my opponent is making here. First, it is not clear that Medicaid patients do get better care than the uninsured. A survey from the GAO found that Medicaid Patients have worse access to physicians than Uninsured patients. Another large study from the University of Virginia found that surgical Medicaid Patients were 13% more likely to die than surgical patients that were uninsured. These studies would suggest that Medicaid patients get worse care than patients that are uninsured. Of course, my opponent cites a recent study from Oregon showing Medicaid patients have better Health Outcomes than uninsured patients. In my view, this study mostly relied on self reported Health, which is different from actual Health outcomes. Regardless, the evidence is not even clear that Medicaid makes patients better off at all, even though it costs over $300 Billion a year. So, basically, we spend massive amounts on a program that does not even clearly have any positive impact on the Health of the recipients. g. ""I agree completely here."" I think my opponent mistook my statement here. I agree that the value of Human Life should be of utmost importance in any debate. However, I disagree that the bill saves lives. In fact, through rationing and lost medical innovation, this bill will cost lives. h. ""It seems that my opponent believes that Health Decisions are too important for individuals to make in a private market, and should therefore be made by the government."" My opponent called this statement an Ad Hominem and Red Herring. I don't see where he is coming from on this. i. ""Insurance Companies may limit care, but not to the extent that governments do."" All Government Health Care systems ration care. In my second argument, I showed that Canada's system involves very long waiting times. Rationing is the only mechanism through which the government can control costs. In fact, the Bills plan to use IPAB to reduce Medicare Payments is, in fact, rationing (even if they don't call it rationing). j. ""I'm not sure what exactly this entails."" Check my last post on price controls. To summarize, Price Controls always lead to shortages. k. ""Again, this means that the government forces young adults to buy Insurance."" This is far from false. A mandate to buy insurance is a key part of bill, basically forcing people to buy insurance. l. ""Yes, those with pre-existing conditions need to be covered. However, forcing insurance companies to cover them will raise prices for everyone."" I offered solutions in my last post that could take care of those with pre-existing conditions without causing significant harm to the rest of the system. On a final note, Insurance Companies are very different from the government because people aren't forced to pay insurance companies by law (although Health care Reform changed that). Free Markets, by definition, are not authoritarian, Government is. Unfortunatley, our modern Health Care system is far from a free market Sources: http://www.cato.org... http://blogs.forbes.com... http://www.avikroy.org..."	PRO	65
Sed146d2b-A75c17795	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	Point 1: Some taxes are justifiable and needed, but the current tax rates are terrible. The taxes we pay for public services with should come from the individual State and not the Country because the public services come from the State, so you would be paying for other's peoples' public services. And the taxes we pay for our social programs and our safety net should be almost completely eliminated. I believe in cutting taxes and spending. Not one or the other. And we should have our own safety net instead of relying on the Government to do that for us. And taxes do not improve overall standard of living because whatever you get out of taxes, you are still paying for it. The Wealthy have no moral obligation or duty to give back to the other people because they fund their life by providing high quality and low price goods. Point 2: Lowering taxes for the individual frees up money so that he or she can buy something and feel comfortable about it with no later regrets. And all of the Bush deficit talk was just Clinton's policies taking into effect. After 2003, the deficits decreased significantly. The rich not only invest in stocks and securities, but they buy multi-million dollar cars, houses, yachts, and much more. And a lot of that money they re-invest back into the business becuase it will make them more money. That is the one good thing about greed. It keeps business alive. And if the rich received tax cuts, they could either countribue to GDP by buying a big-ticket item or go invest in his or her business(s) which will help them by getting them more money, help the workers by having better working conditions, salaries, and a reduced risk of being laid off, and helps the consumer buy letting him or her have a high quality good at a lower price, which is very appealing in bad economic times. And again, it is not the Government's job to institute Social Programs or to build safety nets. Point 3: Like I said, you can use the sales tax during inflation. That would lower GDP, thus curbing inflation. I guess drop this tax. Point 4: I am not saying you should end Social Security, I said that it should be privatized (for businesses), and even then, it should be the employee's choice. And the businesses offering social security would not give it up because one, it does not waste their money, and two, makes sure their employees live a good life (yes, businesses care about their employees). Privatized Social Security would not only decrease taxes, reduce the deficit, and reduce Government aspending, but it would benefit the employees better than National Social Security because they can opt out when they are in a difficult financial situation and need money. Point 5: The property taxes penalize people with a lot of land. Poor or rich. A poor farmer with the same land as a billionaire would be paying the same in property taxes. It reduces agricultural yield. And the estate taxes (or inheritance taxes) are unnecessary for the same reason because they affect the poor and rich because all people inherit. And I said inheritance taxes, not estate taxeds. All pay taxes for inheritance. Point 6: If they are sold underground, by nature they are not paying taxes because that is the definition of underground selling. And excise taxes do not reduce likeihood that people engage in dangerous/poor behaviors because most of these behaviors are addictive, and they will buy the product no matter the price. And why do you think they repealed prohibition? Because prohibiting dangerous materials of that nature (not hard drugs, like alcohol or smoking) should not be prohibited or penalized by the Government. That is not their job, and they should not because it is unconstitutional. Point 7: It's not the tax cuts, it's the market speculation and Obama. The tax cuts again by nature free up money for businesses because they have more to spend. If their amount of money is over their current safety net, they will expand. There is a constant point on the safety net. It is not forever. When they expand, by nature again, they build more businesses, thus increasing GDP, hire more, this reducing unemployment and increasing GDP (because they have more money to spend), and it encourages more companies to do things like that, thus making a meaningful difference in the economy. And like you said, if the tax code was more efficient, it would increase foreign investment. Point 8: The current energy sources are fossil fuels, and it has been proven on numerous occasions that renewable energy is a lot less effective than fossil fuels. We should not be in a rush to move to renewable energy sources because it will cause a crushing recession and will slow travel down by over 95%, thus making the economy even worse. And the rich already pay more than their fair share in taxes, and the poor pay less than their fair share in taxes. Point 9: If the Government would reduce spending (which it needs to do), the current tax system would be outdated. And that quote you gave that said that the rich pay less taxes than the middle class is impossible because the current tax rates say otherwise. Contra: Sorry if this was a semi-lousy argument with no sources. I have a slight fever and forgot about my debates until it was almost too late. I will make my argument better and have a lot more sources for the next round.	PRO	66
Sda116120-A46056a57	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	"Many thanks, once more, to Wylted for this debate. It's surely been interesting. In this round, I'm going to respond both to his constructive arguments and to his third round rebuttals. In Response to PRO's case: ""Against the IRS"" PRO's argument begins with a criticism of the IRS, and a poll to demonstrate that point. But, that people are dissatisfied with the IRS doesn't mean that FT (a specific kind of tax reform) should be adopted. Maybe the tax code does need to be changed. Maybe it doesn't. My burden here is only to show that whether the tax code is flawed or not, FT shouldn't replace the code we've got now. ""A Simpler Code"" As I've shown in the previous round, PRO's argument that FT simplifies things is without merit, but let's explore that point in more detail. FT is a simplification only to the extent that the burden it places on individuals when they file their taxes is comparably less than the status quo. When considering the impact that FT will have on the economy, wages, inflation and prices the magnitude of that burden is shown to be far more than PRO's made it seem. As I've stated in the previous round, at best the middle class is financially exactly as well off as they are now under FT, but even that's not accounting for the massive transition costs and similarly assuming 100% compliance. (1) Moreover, in positing that FT is simpler, PRO fails to account for the transition costs that necessarily follow from the status quo to the FT's implementation as much as he ignores the logistical problems of collection. As Bartlett (2007) explains, ""massive evasion is inevitable with [FT] because all revenue would be collected at just one point in the entire economic system... final sales."" (1) The impact, then, is that the ""well developed reporting requirements for income that has been in place for many years and withholding of taxes to ensure compliance"" is abandoned, and replaced under FT with a system which ""makes the tax collection process very fragile"" because it eases the extent to which tax evasion is possible and reduces the enforcement power for collecting taxes generally. (1, 4) It cannot be, then, that FT is ""the best known available solution to the current system"" as PRO argues because by collecting taxes only at the point of final sale, as FT proposes, FT is collecting taxes at the retail level which is empirically the level of ""greatest evasion."" (1) ""More fairness, less loopholes"" PRO contends that politicians ""don't like [FT] because they can't reward their friends, [etc.]..."" in considerable error because, once more quoting Bartlett (2007), there is no possibility that the FT or it's rebate ""would be free of future political manipulation, as politicians decide that some groups deserve something extra and others deserve punishment - just as is the case with the tax code today."" (1) And moreover, as Sullivan (1995) articulates ""there is nothing in the history of the federal tax legislative process to suggest that a federal consumption tax would be untainted by special interest provisions."" (5) ""Revenue Neutral"" I'm not really sure why PRO's arguing that revenue neutrality is a reason to adopt the FT, because even if it were true, if the tax system is revenue neutral than taxes are not lowered (which is bad if you're a Republican and lowering taxes is something you want) and also not raised (which is equally bad if you're in the business of making the wealthy pay their 'fair share -whatever that may be). But, what PRO doesn't realize is that FT is only revenue neutral if it achieves (a) 100% compliance for all those kinds of new taxes on things that weren't previously taxed like new houses, labor services, food (in some states), medical care and supplies, government transactions and the like and (b) people spend 100% of their annual incomes -which, as I explained in the previous round, just doesn't happen in all cases because as income rates go up, percentage of consumed income drops -and would probably drop even more because taxes on final sales would disincentivize consumption. (1, 4) And it's a but myopic to assume, for reasons mentioned above, that there could even feasibly be total compliance and even if there was, the burden of taxing all goods and services at the point of final sale would almost necessitate economic recession, barring some kind of intervention by the Fed which, even if it did happen -would make no one better off in PRO's world vs. the status quo. ""23% Tax Burden"" This is just not true. As Bartlett, quoting Linder and Chamberliss (here writing in the WSJ, 2007) explains, ""In reality, [FT] is not 23%."" This figure is arrived at ""by calculating the tax as if it were already incorporated into the price of goods and services... think of it this way: if a product costs $1 at retail, [FT] adds 30%, for a total of $1.30 Since the 30-cent tax is 23% of $1.30, [FT] supporters say the rate is 23% rather than 30%."" But even still, the impact to young adults who are in the process of establishing themselves is staggering, in that it unfairly penalizes ""those who may need to borrow and consume heavily... by buying their first cars, first homes and all the furnishings that go with them, and possibly pay for the costs of child rearing as well."" (1) Likewise, implementing FT would effectively leverage an insidious form of double taxation on those who saved their income at a time when income was taxed. (1) ""Corporations are leaving"" There is no evidence that even if corporations are shifting out of the United States, that the cause of their leaving could be remediated by implementing FT. PRO hasn't substantiated that point, because the evidence he offers only shows a marginal impact of what corporate taxes under the status quo. He's not offered anything that could lead us to believe that (a) those corporations which have left would come back, (b) that more corporations wouldn't leave for other reasons due to unanticipated costs under his plan, (c) that the aggregate economic costs of implementing/transitioning to FT wouldn't make the United States a more hostile environment to economic activity generally, or (d) that by requiring retail corporations to act as tax collectors, that their operations wouldn't be catastrophically be cut back, that consumer prices wouldn't increase or that consumption generally wouldn't be harmed because of the increased cost of doing business -any one of which would result in a harm much greater than the fractional benefit of individuals not having to file a 1040. ""Banks"" Ostensibly, passing taxes on consumption might have the effect of 'taxing' activity of the rich that was previously not taxed. But, if the super rich (those who have enough cash to hide it in Swiss Bank Accounts) have the kind of means to hide their money off shore, it's also probably the case that they have the means to buy (especially expensive luxury) products and high-cost services outside of the United States. FT would create a compelling incentive for them to do precisely that, because the super rich would save money by not buying goods and services in the United States. But moreover, there's no reason to think that not only the rich -but everyone- would collectively consume fewer goods and services if a 30% increase was to be leveraged on all goods and services in the US. Rather, there are a whole lot of reasons to assume that economic activity, when consumption is taxed, is going to stagnate whether there's a prebate or not -which is a harm that far outweighs any achievable good PRO's suggested might follow. (1, 2, 4) So, PRO's point about banking holds no water. Brief Response to PRO's most erroneous rebuttals to my case: PRO never actually countered Bartlett (2007)'s explanation that ""there is essentially no relationship between the rebate and the cost of living or raising children."" (1) He just explained why the rebate would exist under FT, but does not account for divergent costs of living in, say, New York versus Texas. Under FT, both New Yorker and Texan taxpayers get the same proportion of tax rebates paid to them every month -which both does not account for the difference in cost of living between NY and TX and amounts to a universal welfare policy insofar as it grants a literal stipend of cash to everyone without regard to whether they have income of their own or not. Calling welfare a prebate doesn't make it not welfare even if taxes are to be taken out of that check at the point of sale and the stipend is intended to offset those taxes. There's also a real difference between what I've said an what PRO refuted on this point.. I said: ""Even still, FT's revenue neutrality rests on the erroneous assumption that ""no matter how large a family's income, 100% of it is consumed every year,"" which is not the case. In reality, the percentage of a person's income being consumed by expenses falls as income rates rise."" But he responds by saying ""The FT revenue neutrality uses no such assumption. The plan exempts used goods from being taxed. Which is a key indicator that it isn't assuming 100% of income is taxed."" I didn't say that 100% of income is taxed under FT, I said that FT is revenue neutral only if 100% of income ""is consumed"" meaning 100% is spent on taxable goods and services. As I've said before, that's just not the case. (1) (PRO's continues to make a lot of assumptions about FT that just hold no weight when their logical implications are explicated in various impact areas. I'll connect the dots in the next round, but now I'm out of character space. Even still, most of what he's said has been ruled out by implication of what I've said in this and the previous round.) Many thanks to PRO for this debate and all judges. I'm out of character space now... lol Another Source: (5) ""Flat Taxes and Consumption Taxes: A Guide to the Debate."" Martin Sullivan.

Sdd22a6ba-Ac73f3a21	Gay marriage should be illegal	"Martin Luther King said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Because I agree with him, I negate. I. Harm principle The debate has to establish a framework that shows at what times the government can properly exercise its authority without embracing some form of authoritarianism. The government's own authority is determined by its purpose. There are multiple theories that try to find what gives the government legitimacy and authority, and they all have agreed that a government lacks legitimacy if it suppresses individual liberties without reasoning. According to John Locke, ""the State of Nature, the natural condition of mankind, is a state of perfect and complete liberty to conduct one's life as one best sees fit, free from the interference of others."" [2] But Locke did not mean people can do *anything.* He agreed that there had to be some limit on liberty. [2] But what decides those limits? John Stuart Mill found a solution: he argued that a person could do anything as long as it doesn't cause harm to non-consensual others. He distinguished between ""other-regarding acts"" and ""self-regarding acts,"" the former being an act that affected non-consensual others and the latter being one that was a decision of oneself. Why should we buy the harm principle? First, the government's legitimacy is entirely decided by the harm principle. The government can't be justified at all, except by the sole purpose of helping its people. A government exists to maximize pleasure and minimize pain; its laws are made to ensure that people are happy. If a government doesn't follow the harm principle -- and exists for some other purpose -- it lacks any legitimacy; therefore, the alternative is absolute liberty and anarchy. Second, the harm principle is inherently utilitarian, since it hinges on minimizing harm and maximizing benefit. The government legislates on utilitarian purposes. Pro's own argument is entirely based on cost-benefit analysis. Utilitarian judgements are based on the harm principle. The harm principle has to be applied to the resolution. The link to the resolution is pretty simple. I argue that gay marriage doesn't harm anyone, so there is no rational basis to ban it. Of course, Pro disagrees, and holds that gay marriage *does* pose harm (e.g. economic harm). So I'm using this argument as a sort of resolutional analysis: if Pro doesn't convincingly show that gay marriage causes harm, presume Con because of the harm principle. II. Discrimination The government has to make logically justified decisions in cost-benefit analysis. As such, its judgement of people has to be based on the choices they make, and *not* based on their characteristics. Basing government decisions on characteristics is absurd. For instance, it is intellectually dishonest and absurd for the government to favor blue-eyed people alone, or only men. The reason patriarchy and racism are rejected are that it is intellectually dishonest and non-utilitarian, and is inherently unjust. The government making unjust decisions is unacceptable. Reject the resolution because arbitrarily basing policy on a person's sexual orientation legitimizes further discrimination. Yep, et al. explain, ""Heteronormativity, as the invisible center and the presumed bedrock of society, is the quintessential force creating, sustaining, and perpetuating the erasure, marginalization, disempowerment, and oppression of sexual others."" [3] That's a little difficult to understand, so let me explain: the idea that heterosexuality is the norm sexual orientation encourages gender roles, that lead to marginalization and oppression of women, transgendered people, and homosexuals. Making gay marriage illegal is an inherent acknowledgement of this discrimination. It would be a symbolic gesture accepting the idea that homosexual love is not equal and would reject it. This rejection causes psychological harm. A study by Wight, et al. shows that same-sex couples that are married have significantly less psychological harm than those that aren't and attributes the cause to the recognition of them as an equal part of society. [4] Not recognizing same-sex marriage promotes stigmatization and expresses the idea that same-sex couples are fundamentally different. As such, it promotes people treating them with discrimination, and further promotes heteronormativity. All recognizing heteronormativity does is encouraging gender roles, since by differentiating heterosexual marriage, it *categorizes* male and female. Gender roles have led to oppression in many circumstances. The government acknowledging heteronormativity is harmful. R1) Economic harms a) Economic benefits outweigh The recognition of gay marriages actually brings more economic benefit than harm. Adam Stevenson (2012) conducted a study that showed that gay marriage would bring in between $20 and $40 billion more in tax revenue. The marriage penalties brought in increase overall labor and this labor, according to the study, isn't cancelled out by the marriage bonus. So, even considering the marriage bonus effect, this much revenue would be gained by the government in income taxes. [5] Multiple state-level studies have shown that, because of gay marriage, the amount of money spent on wedding ceremonies, gifts, et cetera, would significantly boost the economy by (1) increasing consumption, (2) allowing greater sales tax revenue, and (3) creating jobs, allowing more income tax revenue and inherently boosting the economy. [6] Another major economic benefit is that since people become more financially secure due to marriages, they will no longer be eligible for government-provided welfare and safety nets. It would save the government hundreds of millions in welfare costs. [7] Pro also doesn't provide a clear impact, since he doesn't provide the *amount* of money lost from gay marriage, so I have nothing to weigh against. Discount Pro's impacts against mine for that reason as well. b) Arbitrary rejection of same-sex marriage Pro's argument is that the more marriages that the government allows, the more revenue it loses. I've already shown above that this is objectively false. But even if it were true, Pro is *arbitrarily* rejecting same-sex marriages alone. Note that, in the status quo, both same-sex and opposite-sex marriage are legal. Pro's advocacy is to ban same-sex marriage. But there's a failure of the link: why is it same-sex marriage that has to be banned and not opposite-sex marriage? If opposite-sex marriage is to be banned, it will, by Pro's logic, generate more revenue (this is given that (a) is wrong; if (a) is right, discard Pro's argument anyway). I also have an impact turn here. By Pro's logic, better for the economy would be to privatize all marriage and distance government from marriage affairs. If this is the case, gay marriage would not be illegal. Note that ""illegal"" is different from abolition of an institution. If the resolution was ""gay marriage should be abolished,"" Pro would win, but the resolution states ""gay marriage should be illegal."" So if the contention is turned into privatization, vote Con. Note that I am *not* advocating for privatization: it is not an advocacy of mine. I am merely saying that by Pro's logic, privatization is the best state of affairs, so Pro is arguing against his position. R2) Marriage is not a right This is a defense; it doesn't provide offensive reason to vote Pro. I never argued that marriage is a ""right,"" only that if it exists, it has to apply to everyone. Furthermore, if marriage is to exist, the government should not impose restrictions based on a persons characteristics -- that is discrimination. But Pro preempts my racism point here by arguing ""race doesn't matter, but gender does matter."" That is a bare assertion. Why does a person's gender identity matter when the government legislates? How is that relevant to same-sex marriage? R3) Morality a) Pro doesn't establish a clear moral framework. He doesn't establish what is ""moral"" or what is ""immoral,"" and whether the government is a moral actor rather than an amoral one. As seen in my harm principle framework, the government should legislate on cost-benefit analysis and base itself on the practical concerns of society. b) Same-sex parents are as good as opposite-sex parents. Pro doesn't prove that a male parent is important as well as a female parent. It is a demonstrated fact that same-sex parents are as good as opposite-sex parents, and the scientific conensus lies with that idea. [8, 9, 10] c) The right to freedom of religion is not absolute. There are multiple exceptions to the freedom of religion. For instance, people are banned from baking cakes for only marriages of a certain race, or from making such racist decisions on the basis of religion (which was one of the major justifications for racism). The freedom of religion can be infringed to prevent discrimination and ensure basic equality within society. Furthermore, this debate is *not* about whether anti-discrimination laws should be abolished; it is whether gay marriage should be legal. Thus, this is also irrelevant. d) Whether people are faithful to their spouses or not is not significant to making same-sex marriage illegal. As long as the knowledge and approval of the partner exists, there isn't going to be any harm to, for instance, the children or the couple. Apply the harm principle here. Furthermore, their open relationships has little to do with them being homosexual; this is a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. A vote for Pro is a vote for sexism and oppression.

Sf08ced27-A4a01f088	Smoking should be banned	"Personal rights Con said that ""The problem is these only affect the people who do the actions"", I already talk about it in the 2nd round. Everyone as human has right to choose what they want to do. This is personal right Con misrepresents my case. I was responding to ""for their own good, we need to ask: Where do we stop? Do we pass laws against smoking in private homes? Against frying food indoors (which also releases known carcinogens into the air)? Eating the wrong kinds of food? Eating too much? Weighing too much? Drinking too much (and not just when driving)? Exercising too little? Should we ban other risky behavior, such as skydiving, bungee-jumping, or riding motorcycles? How about drinking more than one cup of coffee each day?"" Even, The World Health Organization""s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) formally classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic (PDF). ""The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances,"" the IARC""s Kurt Straif told the South China Morning Post. ""We consider this to be the most important environmental carcinogen, more so than passive smoking. Just because environmental pollution also causes cancer, does not mean we should not ban smoking. This is the same logic as not banning drunk driving because non-drunk people also cause traffic accidents. So, if government should keep people from harm : marijuana, vehicle, alcohol and more should be banned. Not only smoking. But, you know that is so illogical. So, con failed to break my argument about personal right and it's also answered about second hand smoke. WRONG! Con misrepresents my argument again: I argued that because marijuana is less harmful than smoking and is not banned, smoking should be banned. I never argued for marijuana legalization. About banning vehicles: see my case about necessary risks in the first round. Con also claims that he has adequately addressed second hand smoke, even though he just put up the opinion of a single person against several reliable metastudies showing that second hand smoke is indeed very harmful. 2. About Business I already explain this very clearly that based on the fact in the 2nd round. I think here, con ignores my argument that based on the fact. We can""t close our eyes that banned smoking give bad influence for economy impact. So, my argument about business and taxing are very clearly and con failed break my argument. So many way to protect people non smoker rights without decrease smoker rights. Government can make regulation about special room for smoker. Except con has not explained it very clearly/ In the second round, all con did was make an unsourced assertion that smoking does impact the economy, when I have shown that credible sources debunked that claim. Having non-smoker rooms is just like having non-drunk driver lanes. CONCLUSION Con has falsely claimed that he has adequately addressed the issue of second hand smoking, when he did not. All he did was put a single opinion against dozens of research papers, aggregated by metastudies linked to in the last round. Con also has falsely claimed that he has adequately addressed the economic impacts of smoking, when in the last round I have clearly shown that to be untrue. Con only made assertions while I used reliable sources. Because the second hand smoking argument was addressed by no more than a handwave and unsourced quote, and my case for second hand smoking was backed up by multiple metastudies each studying multiple study papers made by real doctors each studying many real people, the second hand smoke argument was proven and it is proven that smoking is not a personal right. Also, con blatantly misrepresents my case and ignores multiple facts based on reliable sources from the last round."	PRO	69
Sf08ced27-A49b08be0	Smoking should be banned	"Personal right Con ignores my arguments on second hand smoke and the fact that marijuana is less harmful than smoking. My arguments still stand. ""If we pass laws forcing smokers to change their behavior ""for their own good, we need to ask: Where do we stop? Do we pass laws against smoking in private homes? Against frying food indoors (which also releases known carcinogens into the air)? Eating the wrong kinds of food? Eating too much? Weighing too much? Drinking too much (and not just when driving)? Exercising too little? Should we ban other risky behavior, such as skydiving, bungee-jumping, or riding motorcycles? How about drinking more than one cup of coffee each day?"" The problem is these only affect the people who do the actions, not others around them. Plus, as argued in round 1, the ones that do affect others in the above list are necessary risks. “Banning smoking may infringe on a person's individual right to behave as he pleases. In addition, basing this prohibition on health reasons may be hypocritical when other substances that may pose similar or greater threats to health, such as alcohol and fattening foods, are allowed. “ This ignores my first argument which showed that marijuana is less harmful than smoking, which by con's logic means that smoking should be banned since marijuana is banned. Plus, in an utilitarian society, personal rights can be reduced to benefit society as a whole. For example, hate speech can be banned but is not a violation of freedom of speech. 2. Second hand smoke Con uses an argument from authority by quoting a single expert and using it to ""debunk"" established, peer reviewed reports. Con ignores the fact that the overwhelming majority of studies support a casual link between second hand smoke and childhood asthma, stroke, and lung cancer. Con uses a single example instead of looking at the overwhelming majority of studies. (http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org...)(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...)(http://www.surgeongeneral.gov...) The above are meta-studies which aggregate results of many studies. 3. Buisiness Con ignores my previous argument, which proved that smoking bans do not affect businesses. Con restates his case instead of providing new evidence. My original argument from last round: Con claims that establishments such as bars and restaurants will get reduced profits if a smoking ban takes place. However, this is not the case: restaurant profits stayed the same, and pub profits dipped slightly but increased in the long run. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...) This proves that economic issues do not result from smoking bans. 4. Taxation While the highest amount of tax per pack of cigarettes is $6.16 in the U.S., the estimated cost of a single pack of cigarettes on society caused by reduced productivity and deaths is $7. Many smaller cities have lower tax rates for cigarettes than $6.16. This shows that even with taxation, smoking is not worth it. (http://www.nytimes.com...) 5. E-cigs Con's argument goes like this: P1. If people can quit smoking, smoking should not be banned. P2. People quit smoking with E-cigs. C. Smoking should not be banned. This does not make sense, as even if people are able to quit smoking, smoking is still a risk. People can quit illegal drugs, but illegal drugs are banned. By con's logic, I can argue that: -People can quit drugs by slowly reducing the amount of drugs they take. -Gradual reduction requires the drugs to be continued to be taken during the quitting period. -Illegal drugs should be legalized because the treatment requires small amounts of them. Conclusion Con has not successfully refuted my arguments, and in one case restated a debunked argument without using sources or new evidence. I believe that I have met my burden of proof."	PRO	70
S14e017ba-A79ae7c46	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Thanks Con for your swift response. --------------Rebuttals---------------- C1: Concerns about Overutilization Your study showed the conclusion that when co-pays were reduced: ""appropriate or needed"" medical care as well as ""inappropriate or unnecessary"" medical care were reduced. However, in a Single-Payer system with low co-pays gives these benefits: Preventive Medicine is Used: Preventive care is less expensive than catastrophic intervention. Often, the uninsured or underinsured end up in emergency rooms because they do not get preventive care or early interventions. For example, an expensive blood pressure pill is cheaper than having a stroke. Therefore, co-pays actually increase the cost of healthcare. [1] Reaching Doctor: Going to the doctor takes time and effort. So, since of this factor, few would actually go to the doctor more than necessary. [1] Smart Card: In a Single-Payer system, a Smart Card could be used such as in Taiwan that includes provider and patient profiles to identify and reduce insurance fraud, overcharges, and duplication of services and tests. The physician puts the card into a reader and the patient’s medical history and prescriptions come up on a computer screen. The insurer is billed the medical bill and it is automatically paid. Taiwan’s single-payer insurer monitors standards, usage and quality of treatment for diagnosis by requiring the providers to submit a full report every 24 hours. This improves quality of treatment and limits physicians from over prescribing medications as well as keeps patients from abusing the system. The Smart Card is a major facet in Single-Payer healthcare efficiency, it makes Single-Payer healthcare remarkably efficient. [2] [3] It streamlines the system. -----------------Further concerns about overutilization: With a Smart Card, patient usage is also tracked. For example, if a patient visits a doctor 20 times a month, the government can visit that patient and have a chat with that person. [3] About your ambulance example, the same would apply. Plus, a co-pay could be based on a patient's income, and when used with a Smart Card, overutilization would become rare. C2: USA already rations care, and doesn't have to: Healthcare in the USA is already rationed. It is rationed, based according to wealth: those who have the money for healthcare get it, and people with more money get it faster. [1] Plus, in Canada and other Single-Payer nations, rationing is public information, publicly accountable by the government. Wait times are published online for all to see. This public attention has led to recent falls in waits there. [4] Since in the USA nobody is accountable for how the system works, it isn't visible on the surface like other nations. Rationing in our system is carried out covertly through financial pressure, forcing millions of individuals to forgo care or to be shunted away by caregivers from services they can’t pay for. [4] As I have said already, the USA system has enough money in it already to fund all necessary medical care for all when spent wisely, with money leftover. Plus, now it sometimes takes months to visit a doctor who accepts insurance. Rationing would not be necessary Also, long waiting lists and rationing in necessary treatments would not occur in the USA with a Single-Payer system because of a few reasons, including the fact that the USA already has abundant healthcare resources in place, and has enough funding. Dr. Ronald Glasser pointed out: ""An axiom of economics holds that nothing can be rationed that is itself not scarce, and, absent evidence of infinite demand and infinite cost, you can't ration healthcare when there are more than enough doctors, hospitals, and high-tech equipment distributed throughout the country to do everything and anything that needs to be done. American healthcare is an unsaturated demand market, and in such markets ""rationing"" is simply a code word for not spending the money to take care of the poor, uninsured, the underinsured, and the high-risk patient."" [5] [6] In the worst situation, another expert, Dr. Linda Peeno said that if we do have to ration care (she is convinced we would not need to), we have an ethical system that makes fair decisions, and ensures that the money goes back into the health system to benefit patients, not stockholders. [5] -----------USA and Waiting Lists------------------- I have shown that the USA has a more advanced medical infrastructure than comparable nations, and that experts have shown that the USA could handle the patients that need care and anything that needs to be done in a much better way, with no waiting lists or short ones. Plus, medical decisions are made between the doctor and patient, NOT the insurance company and doctor. In Canada in 2006, 80% of Canadians were satisfied to their access to healthcare. [5] And because of the new publicly available information, waiting times are decreasing. [4] Plus most rationed procedures in national healthcare countries are elective (nonlifesaving - such as cataract surgery). [1] Single-Payer systems universally have better results than private healthcare systems: http://www.photius.com... C3: Quality in USA system In total, 59% of physicians have said that if the USA switched to a national healthcare system, it would be a positive change. [7] Most say they favor because their patients suffer under our fragmented private system. France doesn't have a ""huge problem with physician shortages"", they are just decreasing, the same as the rest of the world, because different factors such as the demands, rewards, etc. More Physicians A Single-Payer healthcare system will provide an opportunity to restructure the USA physician workforce, and with approaches such as loan forgiveness for graduating medical students, and increased funding for medical education this will be possible. Reimburesment reform and other reforms would help as well under a Single-Payer system. We should have at least 50 percent of our physicians in primary care fields. [4] Health Planning Board You misunderstood, the board wouldn't decide on what literal treatments would be approved and denied, but would decide what would be PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT BASED ON LOCAL SITUATIONS. Drug Innovation Many new drugs are based on federally funded research usually done at universities or at the N.I.H. Plus, drug companies in nations with Single-Payer systems such as in Europe are still very profitable and highly innovative. With a new system, it would be more affordable, and just as innovative. [1] Decreases Costs and Funding Administration costs, overhead, profiting, advertising, etc. increases health care costs. A non-profit Single-Payer plan would be more affordable. A 7% payroll tax on employers would be utilized. Plus, an individual 2% income tax increase would occur. The payroll tax would replace all other employer expenses for employees’ health care, which would be eliminated. The income tax would take the place of all current insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket payments, and for the vast majority of people, a 2% income tax is less than what they now pay for, particularly if a family member has a serious illness. It is also a fair and sustainable contribution. [4] So, you see enormous savings. Bankruptcies Rationing wouldn't be needed, so no more medical bankruptcies. Sources: [1] Conrad, Jessamyn.

Sb841f71e-A81374765	Taxes Should Not Exist in the United States	"I shall begin by responding to your first point in Round 2: ""Ridiculously high? Why exactly? Considering that people could actually economize, skimping on the purchase of those services they don't need (impossible when everyone is required to purchase every service), there would be less for the government to do-- it would surely be cheaper than taxes, and if your argument is comparing the price to anything but taxes it is irrelevant."" Touche. Quite a valid point. It was careless of me not to think that through. However, like I said, I believe I strayed from the point in the paragraph to which you were responding. Clarification of definitions: (1) demand (as a verb) - to call for or require as just, proper, or necessary; to ask for with proper authority (both of these can be found here: http://dictionary.reference.com...) (2) impose (again, as a verb) - to lay on or set as something to be borne, endured, obeyed, fulfilled, paid, etc.; to put or set by or as if by authority (again, both of these can be found at http://dictionary.reference.com...) Seems to me, by these definitions, I can legitimately stand by my assertion that user fees are, in fact, a form of taxation, provided I clarify the following: user fees are nonetheless ""demanded"" from or ""imposed"" upon the individual; the only difference is that they're conditional. Let's take an example. Suppose your house catches on fire, and the government requires user fees before (or after) they permit the fire department to take action. You can choose to do nothing (in which case your house burns down completely), or you can decide to take advantage of the government's offer. If you choose to do the latter, the government is still ""demanding"" taxes from you, OR ""imposing"" them, at least within the context of your decision. To strengthen my argument, I wish to take note of the fact that if you consider the above example to not be a form of taxation, and you maintain that taxation cannot definitively be conditional, then logically you'd have to consider the income tax in this country (as it stands now) not to be a tax. After all, the government threatening you with a gun or jail time is still conditional. You can choose to either refuse (in which case, you get imprisonment, or, under more oppressive regimes, you get shot), or you can can choose to pay (in which case you receive the services the government provides, and you DON'T get imprisoned or shot). Though this example may seem somewhat extreme, it is nonetheless sufficient. It is perfectly analogous to the fire department example; the only difference is the severity. Furthermore, in order to remain consistent, someone in your position would have to consider sales tax on private industries NOT to be a form of taxation. After all, the tax is ""imposed"" on the citizen who purchases a product, but it's only within the context of his or her decision. I would also like you to be aware that common usage of a word does not necessarily mean that word is being used correctly, nor does it determine the definition of the word. Here are some examples (they may seem off the wall, but they're the first ones that came to mind): (1) Caucasian - people assume it simply means ""white,"" or ""white person."" However, Caucasian is actually a broader term, referring the Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Indians (India Indians, not Native Americans), among others. (2) literally - people misuse this word constantly, using it as if it means ""actually"" (e.g. I'm literally going to love this). When really, it means: in accordance with, involving, or being the primary or strict meaning of the word or words; not figurative or metaphorical (http://dictionary.reference.com...) (e.g. I am literally working around the clock (i.e. this would mean that someone is actually working around a physical clock, which is most likely laying on the ground somewhere) ). And last but not least, the definition of ""money."" Money, as I've stated, is a circulating MEDIUM of exchange. This means that something has to be placed between the exchange of two products. In other words, it does not and cannot include direct trading of two products. With that said, check this link: http://en.wikipedia.org... It states that Mesopotamia was the first to use ""money."" And Mesopotamia, of course, did have a government."	CON	72

Sed146d2b-A1fa6ea32	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	We are debating that taxes should be either significatly cut or cut altogether. Like the income tax should be significantly cut and there should be one flat tax rate for all income groups. Taxes like the sales tax should be cut altogether during a recession, and should be significantly cut in all other times. I will be arguing that these polices are good, and you are arguing that these policies are bad. Thank you in advance to the debater that accepts this.	PRO	74
Sed146d2b-A768669d	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	Point 1: I do not object that the rich payer higher amounts of the total tax base. This is because they have much more money. They, however, do not pay much more in percentage amounts. We need to end nearly all loopholes, or let the Bush Tax Cuts expire for all to reduce the deficit. It is simple mathematics. About high tax rates, yes they do reduce competitiveness, we need an equilibrium. If we have enough revenue, and a fiscally prudent, effective government, the nation will flourish. A nation with strong infrastructure with 25% tax-to-GDP is more attractive than a lawless, crumbled 5% tax-to-GDP country. Health Care and Infrastructure: Single-Payer healthcare is a great way to fix the system. It covers all, returns competition to the system between medical professionals and hospitals instead of insurance priorities, it also removes all of the paperwork and costs for profits, marketing, etc. It could cover all uninsured people currently and have a surplus from the funds being spend right now. Competition leads to 45,000 deaths a year, a poor healthcare system, rationing based on income and wealth class, and puts us in a bad spot. Infrastructure is great for a Capitalist nation. Building it is a great idea with government funding, private constructing. Your source is misguided. Here is mine, a real source: http://www.pnhp.org... Point 5: I addressed this problem in round 3. A social safety net is constitutional. Point 6: Social Security - The point isn't primarily about saving, although it is important. We have to remember that without Social Security, over 38 million more seniors will be plunged into poverty. It is a form of redistribution, that allows the rich to help their workers who make them rich. It is moral, Constitutional, and common-sense. http://www.cbpp.org... Point 7: I don't exactly know which topic you are discussing, but I have explained how a social safety net is Constitutional, and helpful to society. If this is on the gas tax, we currently have no alternative in funding our highways. If a better idea was proposed to fund the transportation infrastructure, I would be happy to hear it. Point 8: Property Tax - It is mostly for school funding. It makes more social equality. Therefore, it would be less heavy of a burden on those will have the least. Point 9: Excise Tax - If it doesn't exist, your cannot have it. Besides this fact, rehabilitation programs for people would be a more effective strategy. Point 10: Corporate Tax - We agree here. Lower this tax and (my opinion) end all loopholes and (my opinion) switch all coal/ oil subsidies to renewable energy (I showed the benefits in R3). However, it should only be lowered for companies that invest in the USA, and have proof of this, because if you don't ask for proof, you won't get any. This is what happened during Bush's tax holiday for corporations, no jobs were created. Remember however, Businesses usually expand with more demand, not more money. Point 11: Renewable Energy - We somewhat agree here. I think that the fossil fuel subsidies should be moved to renewable energy, and I showed why in R3. However, we can use natural gas in the USA as well as renewable energy, if the process that extracts it - I believe it is called fracking - is done in a responsible way. We however need to put more government help into starting the renewable energy industries in the USA, to help the economy, public health, and fight global warming. Point 12: Cuts in Spending - I agree on cuts, but disagree on what cuts. I think that we need to reduce food subsidies, reduce the Department of Defense (like some defense officials suggest), end electric, and fossil fuel subsidies, privatize the power marketing administrations, Block grant Medicaid and freeze spending, (in coordination with ObamaCare plan), and other numerous subsidies we don't need right now. Tax policy needs to be reformed too. Conclusion: The rich have a moral obligation to help the society that allowed them to get rich off publicy funded infrastructure. The government can help facilitate progress in a nation. Also, corporations have to pay their fair share, and will be rewarded with a stronger society. Thank you Pro for this debate.	CON	75
Sb841f71e-A7ea35e7d	Taxes Should Not Exist in the United States	"The logistics of operating a government based on user fees is, in practical terms, ridiculous (at least for a nation as large as the United States). In order for it to work, individuals would have to pay user fees for just about anything, or would have to pay ridiculously high prices for services that do have user fees. However, I believe I've strayed from the point. As for whether or not taxes can be considered ""stealing,"" your explanation as to why taxation is, in fact, a form of stealing, is beyond sufficient. Nonetheless, this explanation can only be applied to certain types of taxation, such as income tax or property tax. Keep in mind that the term ""tax,"" in noun form, means ""a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc."" (as defined by dictionary.com (specifically http://dictionary.reference.com...) ). I would also like to take note of the somewhat more detailed definition of taxation provided by Wikipedia: ""To tax is to impose a financial charge or other levy upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a state or the functional equivalent of a state"" (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Both of these definitions state that taxes are imposed BY a government (or a functional equivalent). This basically means two things: (1) user fees are no less a type of taxation than any sum of money levied upon privately provided products or services is; the only difference, of course (as you've noted), is that taxation on the latter is stealing, whereas taxation on the former (or ""user fees,"" as you put it) is not. (2) Despite your assertion that taxes existed before government, taxes could not have existed without some sort of governing influence. By the way, on an awkwardly related note, I found an article concerning the earliest known system of taxation on the University of Pennsylvania Almanac website (http://www.upenn.edu... (found through Wikipedia) ), and found that Egypt's was the earliest. It was imposed by the Pharaoh, so there was, in fact, a firm government already in place. However, I'm sure that, when defined more loosely, you could find earlier forms of taxation. I'd be interested in hearing your examples. Nonetheless, I still maintain that their could not have been taxes without some sort of governing influence in place. So, the following should serve as a reminder for both of us, so as not to distract from the main point: the debate does not concern the issue of what TYPE of taxes should exist; the debate simply pertains to the issue of whether or not ANY taxes should exist. And as I've more or less stated, all you've really done is provided another form of taxation; you haven't explained why taxes should simply not exist."	CON	76
S2d55d1c3-A7504f039	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	Pro says, I am incorrect with regards to quality education & healthcare being provided by governments and bases this on a spending to GDP ratio. Simply using a healthcare spending to GDP ratio is not an accurate way to measure how well one country provides healthcare as compared with another because in wealthier countries people will tend to spend more on whatever they think will make their lives better, including healthcare. Next, pro implies we have more expensive healthcare because we spend more but use doctors and hospitals less. When one analyzes the situation though, it indicates that people in the U.S. on average are much healthier than those in countries with socialized healthcare because they don’t have to see doctors as often, nor do they have to go to hospitals as often or stay there as long. So perhaps it is more expensive for certain services but it is because they are higher quality services than in nations with national healthcare. Also, pro has agreed that in marketplaces, competition will cause quality to increase and prices to fall thus affirming my central premise for free markets. Pro agrees that, people who can afford U.S. healthcare will come. As to Americans travelling to countries with national healthcare, this is simply a way of gaming the system so that people who care a little less about the quality of their healthcare can get it for free. For those who actually live in these nations, the service is definitely not free, it comes from taxes paid by their citizens. Pro also indicated another problem with socialized healthcare, it encourages people to scam the system. If it were simply market based, then those who use the service pay and if they don’t pay, they either take on debt or don’t get served. Another problem with socialized healthcare is that there is no incentive to compete to improve operations. Also if capitalism is allowed to work unburdened, it creates wealth, employment, and low cost products which allows those who currently can't afford care, to be treated with high quality care in the future. On education, pro still ignores the fact that private education for lower income people would have become more affordable because of growing wealth and household income at the time (see comments for actual source) and because of an incentive for businesses to reach more of the growing education market. This also applies to pro’s argument regarding families who can’t afford education. Pro says that taxes are good to pay for someone in need. To answer this I point out an argument I made in the first round, public education is not cost effective and is detrimental. I would also like to quote here Ayn Rand, “Do not ever say that the desire to “do good” by force is a good motive. Neither power-lust nor stupidity are good motives.” Also, the free market doesn't distribute wealth from the bottom up. The likely reason that pro thinks this is that he assumes a zero sum game. If economics were always a zero sum game of shared scarcity, then GDP would never grow, instead, GDP can grow and shrink. Also, under free market systems, like the U.S. during the industrial revolution, incomes of the “working class” grow (see comments for figures). Also, it is a good thing for these people dependent on the government to be cut off because if they aren’t, then they will likely go on being dependent. Cutting them off gives them an incentive to find work. Regarding monopolies, pro is incorrect when he says businesses will collaborate when unregulated to produce an oligopoly. If this happened in an unregulated market and the oligopoly became abusive of its power, all it would take to topple the oligopoly would be someone who could provide the same service at a reasonable cost. Even if this person began as a small business, he/she would begin to gain more customers and the profits would grow along with business thus re-introducing competition to the market. I explained this process in the very first round. Pro agrees that government will not always answer to the public but counters by saying that my examples of oppressive government never gave people a voice. While it is true that the DPRK, Iraq, and the USSR never had democracy to give people a voice, they still helped sweep their later oppressive leaders into power in these countries as well as in the PRC. Also, Hitler was made chancellor by the Weimar Republic, and Marcos was elected. The Roman Republic also saw public representation through the Senate, Tribunes, and popular election of proconsuls yet, by Caesar’s time, the state had so much power that he was able to start a chain of events leading to emperors such as Nero, Caligula, and Caracalla. Representative democracies and republics can clearly go awry if too much power is ceded to them. Even if my pro supports socialization of food and housing only for the needy, the problem still remains that it is a disincentive to work for your own food and housing (see con premise 1 round 2). Pro also claims that free markets are unable to provide food for the poor, yet lacks any evidence or logic to support this claim and, as mentioned earlier, agrees with my central free market premise (above). On wages, pro says I have misrepresented his argument to mean that businesses will underpay employees when possible but as this quote from his second round rebuttal reveals, I have not misrepresented it at all: “In his rebuttal to my third premise, my opponent claims that competition would cause businesses to not pay their workers pennies a day.” Thus implying that businesses will pay workers pennies a day absent regulation. Also, pro uses the pre-Progressive Era as an example of underpayment of workers but still forgets that income rose during that time by 75%(see comments). Thus pro’s claim that these people need protection against their employers falls. Pro also attacked the labor value argument by trying to say that low-wage professions are not subject to the same market forces as high-wage ones. This is simply illogical, supply and demand and the value of a product govern all free markets regardless of the industry. Also, pro did not actually counter that wages were initially low because of the initially slow growth of wealth. Neither the New Deal nor the Progressive era created more wealth or wealth creating jobs, they only served to take it from hard working Americans and business owners and run it through dead weight losses to wind up with less value than earlier in the pocket of someone digging a useless ditch or of someone who was not working at all. This does not end poverty, it only spreads it by punishing success, rewarding failure and bleeding wealth creators dry. Pro now affirms that the property rights system works to punish but fails to understand that it also serves as a deterrent because of the money that would have to be spent on lawsuits. It also creates an incentive to produce more efficiently. This means that environmental regulation would be unnecessary and as per my arguments from round 2, detrimental. In the next round, I would like pro to provide specific examples of the free nations referenced in his last rebuttal on this issue so that I may provide a proper answer. That being said, the development of oppressive government doesn’t happen instantly. It takes time for this to happen but to avoid unnecessary risk, government must be limited to the three tasks from my arguments on the first premise. While the market won't always prevent trusts, it will most of the time and when a natural monopoly occurs, it either does not last long or is nothing to worry about (first round). Antitrust legislation doesn't encourage competition by protecting businesses from more successful businesses, the very idea of protecting one business from another is antithetical to competition. If a business knew that it didn’t need to improve itself because all its competitors would be cut down by legislation, then there would be no incentive to do so.	CON	77
S22d02825-Ad04c73a7	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"First, I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I will provide a rebuttal to his arguments here: a. Con: ""The ""Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting both pieces of legislation [Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, Public Law 111-148); and, following that, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which together make ""the health care reform""] will produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $143 billion over the 2010-2019 period."" It is true that the CBO provided an estimate that showed Health Care Reform reducing the Deficit, but this estimate has come under intense scrutiny. The former Director of the CBO, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, has estimated, in an New York Times OP-ED, that Health Care Reform will increase the Deficit by $562 Billion over the next decade: ""Removing the unrealistic annual Medicare savings ($463 billion) and the stolen annual revenues from Social Security and long-term care insurance ($123 billion), and adding in the annual spending that so far is not accounted for ($114 billion) quickly generates additional deficits of $562 billion in the first 10 years. And the nation would be on the hook for two more entitlement programs rapidly expanding as far as the eye can see."" Even this does not take into account everything. Government Programs are notorious for being more expensive. In 1966, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that Medicare would cost $12 Billion by 1990 (Adjusted for Inflation). In fact, it ended up costing $107 Billion in 1990, almost 9 times as expensive as projected. Another thing to add is that the Health Care Bill is funded largely by new taxes on the rich. While these taxes may raise some revenue, they will likely raise much less than expected. In response to higher tax rates, these wealthy will shelter more income, work less, and ultimately report less taxable income. How large these effects are is debatable, but there is wide agreement that they do exist. This means that the revenue projections are at least somewhat over optimistic. For these reasons, I argue there is strong reason to doubt the CBO estimate of Health Care Reform's impact on the Deficit. In fact, I suspect that Health Care Reform may even increase the Deficit by more than the $562 Billion that Holtz-Eakin estimated. b. Con: ""Actually, the health care reform does not create a government run health care program such as in Canada [2]. And Massachusetts does not have government run health care either [3]. The program that has been in Massachusetts as well as the health care reform package only serve to help everyone become insured [2, 3]. Furthermore, a waiting-line crisis does not exist in Canada [4]. That is propaganda with no substantiation. Canada has a much higher patient satisfaction rate than America [5]."" I understand that the Health Care Reform Legislation does not create a Government Run Health Care Program. However, it does significantly expand the role of government in the Health Care Sector, and it does brings us closer to the system that they have in Canada. I strongly disagree with the idea that the waiting time problem in Canada is just ""propaganda"". I do not know exactly how a ""crisis"" would be defined, but there is no doubt that waiting times are a large problem in Canada. A November 2010 Commonwealth Fund Study (and I will remind my opponent that the Commonwealth Fund is no fan of American Health Care), found that 41% of Canadians waited 2 or more months to see a specialist, while only 9% of Americans had to wait that long. It also found that 31% of Canadians had to wait 4 or more hours in the ER, only 13% of Americans had to wait that long in the ER. This study also found that 33% of Canadians had to wait 6 or more days to see a nurse or doctor when they need care, only 19% of Americans had to wait that long. Finally, the study found that 25% of Canadians had to wait 4 or more months to get non-emergency surgery, only 7% of Americans had to wait that long. Whether or not this is a waiting time crisis is debatable, but there is no doubt that Canadians have to wait substantially longer than Americans for care. As for the high patient satisfaction rate in Canada, I will concede this (although I have seen polls that show the higher patient satisfaction rate in Canada is much exaggerated). This does not, however, prove Canadian Care is better. You must remember that Americans have much higher standards than Canadians. Paul Ryan, for example, would not be very satisfied with most high quality beer when he is used to $350 wine (thought I would throw a little relevant humor in). c. Con: ""Incorrect. A study ""by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) reveals that Medicaid recipients have far greater access to doctors, live healthier lives and enjoy more financial stability than those who must go without."" [6]."" It is likely that Medicaid Recipients get better care than the uninsured, but not by as much as one would expect. The point I was making is that Medicaid Patients have far worse access to care than privately insured patients. There was a study in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" that found that 66% Children on SCHIP or Medicaid were denied an appointment when they needed care, only 11% of Children on Private Insurance had their appointments denied. This study confirms an earlier Health Tracking Survey from the Center for Studying Health System Change that found that interns were 8.5 times more likely to reject Medicaid Patients than Privately Insured Patients. More Recently, a study from the Government Accountability Office found that Doctors were far more likely to take private patients than Medicaid Patients, but also slightly more likely to take uninsured patients than they were Medicaid Patients. (I link to all of these studies at the bottom of this post) Even though it is possible that Medicaid Patients get better treatment than the uninsured, it is not convincing that the Medicaid Program is worth its high cost. Medicaid Patients have access to substantially less care than private patients and only slightly more (if any more at all) than uninsured patients. My argument is that we should not be expanding a program that already is having major problems in providing adequate care to its recipients. Given the studies I outlined earlier, it seems that Medicaid does not provide adequate care. d. Con: ""The health care reform legislation has nothing to do with a Single Payer Health Care system [2]. I would have much preferred that it did, though."" I partially agree with this. After all, the Health Care Reform Bill could not, in any way, be classified as Single Payer. However, in my original argument I was referring to how I wanted this debate to be about larger Health Care policy, not just the 2010 Legislation. Apart from that, many strong supporters of Health Care Reform are advocates of Single Payer and simply saw the final result as the best they could get. Even though the bill does not bring about Single Payer, I do believe that it brings us much closer to a Single Payer System, as it does represent a major expansion of government into the Health Care Sector.

S38f1c3c6-Add0607f2	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"I'll go ahead and address each point my opponent made one by one. Then, I will provide voting issues. Definitions and Observations My opponent notes that resource extraction is any way of obtaining a resource. I would agree with this statement completely. However, we have to realize that not all forms of resource extraction do damage to the earth. I am not restricting my opponent to any certain type of resource extraction, however, if the form of resource extraction does not come into conflict with environmental protection then it is out of the scope of the resolution. Example: So, obtaining water could be considered resource extraction, but if it doesn't cause conflict with environmental protection then it is not an issue. If it does, then obviously the process of extracting water would not be taken away. Rather, developing countries would find a way to prioritize environmental protection by finding a more green method of obtaining water. Opponent's Arguments Surplus Money I'll address each point made here. P1: Resource extraction is used to create surplus wealth. P2: Resource extraction costs money. P3: Green technology can be and almost always is more expensive than base technology. C1: Developing Nations should create surplus wealth before buying green technology. Here, my opponent is assuming that developing countries have no money to prioritize environmental protection. I'll make a few points: 1. As the resolution says, we are debating instances where environmental protection and resource extraction are in conflict. The reason they are in conflict is because the resource is giving the country money... As my opponent says, resource extraction creates surplus wealth. So if the two are in conflict, we can assume that is because money comes from resource extraction (if the resource made no money, what would be the point of extraction?) 2. This surplus wealth (whether the resource is causing environmental problems or not) is mostly going to the elite of society. The impoverished are not benefited. 3. Some of the surplus wealth SHOULD be used to prioritize environmental protection if that certain type of resource extraction is causing environmental issues. Remember, developing countries also obtain surplus money from resources that do not hurt the environment. Because of corruption, the money doesn't go where it should. Realistically, if a government is corrupt, environmental protection is probably not a priority. However, this debate is over whether developing countries SHOULD prioritize environmental protection (rather than if they will). My opponent then goes on to explain that I cannot claim environmental protection/resource extraction scenarios are too broad to answer. I would agree with this. However, this does not change the fact that every developing country has different issues. Some issues are a simple fix, while others are more complex/expensive. As I explained above, developing countries can use the surplus wealth from resources for environmental protection. If the issue is to complex for the country to resolve on it's own, then often developed countries will step in. My opponent has provided absolutely no examples of a developing country that was unable to prioritize environmental protection due to lack of money, nor has he provided a country that was negatively impacted by environmental protection. Thus, my BoP is upheld. P1: If nations had money to be green they would. P2: Nations who don't have money to be green, need to make money. C1: Developing countries should prioritize making money before trying to be green. To summarize what I've said before... An environmental protection/resource extraction conflict implies that surplus wealth is coming from the resource. Developing countries can use this money to be green. Environmentalist Rhetoric My opponent explains that making money is step one and becoming green is step two. I agree. However, developing countries do have money. It may not be a huge amount but (given that resources are being extracted) there will be some degree of surplus wealth. This should be spent on environmental protection if the resource extraction is hurting the environment. My opponent shows that trading commodities are the only available market for developing countries. We have to remember that the prioritization of environmental protection does not result in such commodities being taken away. Prioritization simply means putting something first. Also, my opponent has not showed whether or not these commodities directly hurt the environment, so many of them could be out of the scope of the resolution and a way of providing surplus wealth for the country to develop/protect the environment. The reason developing countries are so poor is that the money is going to the wrong place. Being green doesn't make developing countries money. I agree that resource extraction will make the most profit. The problem is, this money is not going to the right places. I have shown in R2 and R3 that due to the resource curse, development is not achieved through resource extraction. The money from resource extraction doesn't even help the people in the country who desperately need it. I have also shown that it is very possible to prioritize environmental protection if it does come into conflict with resource extraction. The most beneficial option is the prioritization of environmental protection because the benefits (as I have said many times) can be felt by nearly everyone. 25% of developing country's wealth comes from the environment. Obviously, it is worth something. Look to my Guatemala example in R3. They lost literally 25% of their GDP due to environmental problems. These issues not only affect people, but affect developing nations wealth as well. My opponent goes on to say this... P1: Being green supports the endeavor of making money. This debate is only over being ""green"" in relation to resource extraction. Being green supports the endeavor of making money while keeping the environment safe to get rid of the negative impacts that come from hurting the environment. P2: Being green does not actually make money itself. 1/4 of all developing nations' wealth comes from the environment. In fact, environmental protection can enable citizens to farm. This will help make the impoverished money (as I showed in the case of Albania). C1: Being green is not a priority to stimulating wealth. It is really the only way that poor citizens can benefit. My Arguments China did not alleviate poverty through resource extraction. My opponent completely misunderstood my argument. I agree that harvesting is resource extraction. However, China alleviated poverty with resource extraction methods that did not come into conflict with environmental protection. Therefore, China's growth in the past cannot be used as an example by my opponent. Resource Preservation I did not intend for this to be a major point in this debate, but I'll go ahead and address it. My opponent concedes that resources will inevitably run out. The point I am trying to make is that if developing countries are relying on the rapid extraction of nonrenewable resources, not only can this negatively impact the earth, but the country will lose the surplus wealth they once counted on when the resources run out. So, if environmental protection slightly slows down the extraction process, this is not a bad thing. The protection of the environment does give developing countries some wealth, and obviously the extraction of nonrenewable resources would not be abolished during the prioritization of resource extraction. My Conclusion 1. Resource extraction (when in conflict with environmental protection) kills. We can't afford to be ""more green later"" when lives are in question. Unclean water and air pollution (which I have shown can be a cause of resource extraction) kill thousands every year. Excessive deforestation will hurt the 1 billion that rely on forest based assets to live. The prioritization of environmental protection will ultimately strive to undo the damage done. 2. Development Social development is achieved with environmental protection. As I showed in R2, the Millennium Development goals are best achieved through the prioritization of environmental protection. Economic development is also achieved because it positively impacts developing countries GDP. My opponent goes on and on about how developing countries do not have enough money to prioritize environmental protection, however he provides absolutely no examples of a developing country with such a problem. There is not one piece of evidence that has shown a developing country being negatively impacted by the prioritization of environmental protection when in conflict with resource extraction. 3. Corruption Never once in this debate has my opponent touched on this point. The money from resource extraction is not going towards development or poverty alleviation. It is going towards the elite in society. The impact is: If the impoverished are to benefit, environmental protection should be prioritized to attempt to preserve clean water and air (which will save lives) and preserve forest based assets that people all around the world need to survive. Environmental protection is the one action that will help everyone, despite the effects of corruption. For these reasons, vote pro. Thank you to ChosenWolff for a great debate!!

S2d55d1c3-A623f71f1	Essential services should be socialized, and privatized services should be regulated.	I will begin by offering 3 main premises for my argument. 1. Most essential services that all human beings are entitled to as members of society should be socialized. Socialized, meaning owned and operated by the community as a whole, whether that means through the Government, or by general worker consensus. Essential services include healthcare, education, food/housing for the poor, roads, public transit, etc. I am now ready to hear from my opponent. 2. Other services (As in, cell phones, TV, internet, food/housing for the well-off, cars, computers, etc.) should be run in a Capitalist manner. Capitalism, meaning private individuals and businesses own the means of production, and they compete within a marketplace. 3. The Government must regulate the services described in premise #2. Regulate, as in ensure the businesses providing those services do not defraud their workers, do not harm the environment, do not form monopolies, etc.	PRO	80

S3cd3a05e-A81ac2cc	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"My contentions are: 1. Reducing poverty brings happiness, but economic equality can be achieved by poverty. I presented data showing that once basic needs are met, added wealth produced little or no increased happiness. Therefore the goal of government should be to raise people out of poverty, not to try to make them equal. For example, data I cited shows poverty rates lowest when inequality measured by the Gini Coefficient was greatest. The Depression brought equality and poverty. Post-war prosperity bought inequality and much less poverty. The fundamental premise of striving for economic equality is wrong. Prosperity vanquishes poverty, not striving for economic equality. I gave a full explanation of why economies are not zero-sum games. If they were, standards of living could not improve, and manifestly they do. 2. Free markets create prosperity. We have numerous examples that cannot be explained otherwise. The deciding factor is not overall authoritarianism or democracy, it is free markets. South Korea and Taiwan had authoritarian governments for many years, but produced prosperity that brought many people out of poverty. The lack of free markets in North Korea and China kept people in poverty, even though those regimes valued economic equality. Similarly, democratic socialism kept people in India in poverty despite despite democracy. India valued economic equality, and got poverty. Only by seeking prosperity and not economic equality were people raised out of poverty. Pro sought examples of valuing economic equality in which prosperity resulted, but could find none. Luxembourg was not made prosperous by redistributing wealth, but rather by economic advantages in banking and industry. The Netherlands brought itself out of near bankruptcy to economic prosperity by strong free market policies that stressed lower minimum wages. Now redistribution policies are running down prosperity. I cited Sweden as another example of redistribution destroying prosperity. I cited the Congressional Research Office finding nearly a hundred studies internationally over fifty years in which minimum wage increase brought unemployment rather than economic equality. Pro says that he grants that minimum wage laws have negative short term effects, but he takes it as an act of faith that the long term is positive. He provides no evidence. I listed what happens when there are high minimum wages: uneconomic businesses shut down, labor is replaced by automation, and low-skill workers are replaced by higher-skilled ore productive labor. Pro gave no reason why any of those should be temporary. A prosperous economy can afford to better take care of the poor, and that's a consequence of seeking prosperity and not a consequence of seeking economic equality. In a prosperous economy there are relatively few poor people, in the U.S. around 14%, so it's possible to take care of them. In societies that value economic equality such as Maoist China or socialist India, there are too many poor people to be cared for. There is no reason to believe that Maoist China or socialist India, or for that matter, communist North Korea, did not value economic equality. Doing so brings poverty. Pro says that the Netherlands is now prospering under it's renewed interest in redistributing wealth, but his source says ""... in Q3 and Q4 2011, the Dutch economy contracted 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively due to European Debt Crisis, while in Q4 the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0.3 percent."" Shrinking is not prospering. The corresponding growth rates in China, where they have diminished interest in redistributing wealth, were for the same periods +2.4 percent and +2.3 percent. http://www.tradingeconomics.com... Pro tries to portray Singapore as place where poverty has increased despite increases in wealth. when Singapore became independent the per capita GDP was $400. In four decades wealth grew to $26,500 per capita GDP, among the highest in the world. Pro claims that poverty increased ""massively"" as the per capita GDP rose. There are no statistics on how wealth is distributed, but it's not remotely plausible that there were fewer poor people when the per capita GDP was $400 and there was more economic equality. Singapore now has extensive social programs and low cost medical care, things that poor countries cannot afford. The report that Pro cites says that inequality may produce unrest, but if so that's a product of envy, not increased poverty. Pro's source on Hong Kong does not say that they have prospered by redistributing wealth. It says that free market principles are being eroded, but ""Hong Kong remains, by and large, a vibrant, entrepreneurial place, with government spending far below Western standards. The costs of rising intervention will take a while to appear—"" Hong Kong seems to be succumbing to the pattern observed in Sweden and The Netherlands. Prosperity leads to less interest in creating wealth and more interest in redistributing it, with the ultimate collapse of the economy the end result. I do not understand what Pro is trying to get at by citing the fact that it took 5 years for the soviet economy to collapse. The Soviets valued economic equality and never had a particularly good economy. The example of Henry Ford is even harder to parse. Ford's manufacturing techniques are an enduring success. ford attracted workers by paying considerably more than alternative jobs. I don't see the relation to Pro's case. Is the point that prosperity does not endure, but equality achieved through poverty stands the test of time? If so, it's not true. the world is in better shape now than at any time in history. Pro asserts that free markets are proved not to work, but his arguments are obscure and bizarre. It is impossible to spin any of the numerous worker's paradises as doing as well as their more free counterparts. 3. Valuing economic equality does not lead to economic equality. Valuing economic equality leads to a ruling elite necessary to control the distribution of wealth. In a free economy in which economic equality is not valued, there is a spectrum of wealth including a fraction of very rich people. Having a ruling elite is a necessary consequence of valuing the redistribution on wealth over a free economy. A government that redistributes wealth must be strong enough to take wealth from some people and give it to others, and that implies a powerful elite to accomplish that function. Pro claims that no ruling elite is required for equal access to courts, a progressive income tax, or a high minimum age. Equal access to courts is as desirable in free markets as in ones that redistribute wealth, but there are substantial costs in maintaining a legal system. A progressive income tax requires a huge bureaucracy. the American Internal revenue Service has 106,000 employees. It costs taxpayers about $500 billion to prepare the tax returns through which they pay about $2200 billion in taxes. A minimum wage law must be policed, and a government apparatus is set up to continually check, some say harass, employers. Pro overlooks what I have been saying through the debate: the decisions of who to take money from and who to give it to are many and complex. In every real case a ruling elite emerges. Investment requires accumulation of capital so there is the money to invest, and it requires a willingness to take risks in return for potential rewards. Government valuing economic equality means that government works to prevent accumulation of wealth by redistributing it. And if a risky investment pays off, government promises to redistribute that new wealth as well. But let suppose that forcing economic equality leads to prosperity. If so, that is valuing prosperity above economic equality, because equality in prosperity is preferred over equality in poverty. The resolution is negated."	CON	82
S5d12ad-A82427f83	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"Thank you for accepting. I will now demonstrate why one should support this proposition. RAPE PREVENTION 1 in 20 inmates are raped[1]. Note that these are not singular occurrences, but most often repeated rapings[2]. Not only repeated rapings, but actual sexual slavery: ""Forced to satisfy another man's sexual appetites whenever he demands, they may also be responsible for washing his clothes, cooking his food, massaging his back, cleaning his cell, and myriad other chores. They are frequently ""rented out"" for sex, sold, or even auctioned off to other inmates, replicating the financial aspects of traditional slavery. Their most basic choices, like how to dress and whom to talk to, may be controlled by the person who ""owns"" them. They may even be renamed as women.(259) Like all forms of slavery, these situations are among the most degrading and dehumanizing experiences a person can undergo.""[2] Offering prostitutes to inmates would nearly wipe out prison rape. The reason most inmates turn to rape is because of years without sex. In their desperation, inmates turn to people of the same gender, something they wouldn't ordinarily do. Understanding of this desperation and loneliness by other inmates makes gay rape much more acceptable, often being dressed up as a status type of thing. Providing these men with prostitutes of their preferred gender would alleviate their horniness without turning to homosexual rape. The analogy I like to use is this: A man has been stranded on an island without food for so long that he begins eating his shoes. He doesn't want to, but he desperately must eat something. If someone offered him cake however, he would drop the shoe in a split second and go to work on the cake. It's just an instance of people settling for the best they can do. Give them the option they wanted in the first place, and the problem here goes away. Perhaps you're thinking, 'why should I care'? You probably have an image of a child molester getting a taste of his own medicine, or some sick murderer suffering. For the people whose thoughts those are, I can't really tell you you should feel bad for those people, however there are plenty of angles you're not examining. First, consider the fact that not all of the 1 in 20 are going to be sickos who you think have it coming. It could be someone who is in jail for possessing drugs. They could've been addicted, not fully in control of themselves, and rape is their punishment? What if it was someone who stole a TV? Do you honestly see repeated rapings and possible sexual slavery as just repayment for a stolen item? There are many non-violent criminals in prison, and few people would think violent sexual assaults are proper repayment for non-violent crimes. Further, consider the threat of AIDS. Most inmates are out in a year, 90% in fact[3]. The rapists in prison are hardly concerned for the sexual health of their victims, and so many rape victims end up with AIDS. Within a year most of these men are back in their communities. We can see that a stage is quite obviously set for disaster here. Therefore, it is not only in the interests of the inmates, but also of society at large, to lessen the occurrence of prison rape, and therein reduce the spread of AIDS. Lastly, consider the fact that AIDS is a death sentence for most who get it. When we condone or turn our backs on the issue of prison rape, we condone or turn our backs on the fact that men who have been given minimal sentences, many non-violent criminals, have effectively been issued the death penalty. This is not what our justice system intended when it sentenced these people to whatever amount of time they were sentenced to, because it is an injustice. If we wanted petty thieves, drug addicts, victims of circumstance: non-violent criminals, to face death, we'd issue them the death penalty, not a year in prison. RECIDIVISM To continue answering the question, 'why should I care?', I'd like to present the fact that this proposal would reduce recidivism. For those of you who are unaware, recidivism is simply a term for how many prisoners return to jail. Studies have shown that harsher prison conditions lead to higher recidivism rates, whereas nicer conditions lead to less post-release crime[4]. Clearly, providing the luxury of prostitutes is the opposite of harsh. As mentioned above, 90% of prisoners are out within a year, and I think we can all agree that it'd be a good thing if less of them committed more crimes. INCREASED PROSTITUTE SAFETY Prostitutes have a pretty rough go of it, and I'd posit that by allowing them to legally practice it in prisons, under the protection of the Federal Government, we'd be able to help some prostitutes live more healthily and safely. As far as how rough they have things, consider: [5] We could reduce the beatings per year, unprotected sexual acts per year, contractions of AIDS per year, arrests for prostitution per year, and STD's related to prostitution significantly. Especially for those employed in this proposition, but also overall, as this program would have to be big enough to service most jails, at the very least the highest-incidence of rape jails. We could reduce beatings very easily. The pimp-prostitute relationship is an abusive one. ""Victims undergo a process of being recruited, groomed, abused, controlled, and being turned out by violent pimps. The result of this step is a """"trauma bond"" between victim and pimp or trafficker that can be equated to Stockholm Syndrome. ""Pimps crush runaways [girls] with a mix of violence and affection, degradation"" and then require absolute obedience to a rigid code: the prostitute cannot look the pimp in the eye, call him by name or keep any cash."" In this way a pimp dehumanizes his prostitute[s] by turning him or her into a commodity.""[6] If we took the abusive pimp out of the equation, beatings per year would doubtless drop. We can assume that the rest of the beatings would come from clients. I think we can all logically infer why that would not be the case with prostitutes working under my proposal. Prisoners would be very careful not to lose their privilege, and given that this prostitution would be legal, she'd be free to report any abuses to her Federal Government 'handler'. We could reduce unprotected sexual acts per year by regulating that condoms be required for these sexual acts. This would also obviously reduce the likelihood of a prostitute getting AIDS, and reduce the amount of AIDS prostitution spreads. Not only would regulated use of condoms reduce this spread, but so would frequent testing for AIDS. Frequent testing would alert Federal 'handlers' whenever a prostitute had been 'contaminated', and they could act according to the third preventative measure. The third preventative measure being a system that would prevent individuals with AIDS from engaging in sex with an individual who did not have AIDS. With condoms, frequent testing, and as I like to call it, 'AIDS-based sexual segregation', we could easily freeze the 50% stat in its place, and eventually push it back. THE GREATER GOOD There may be some who have finished all the above and think that promoting prostitution anywhere is immoral. I have a very short, simple reply for these people. Which would you rather happen, unconsensual sex, or consensual, paid sex? Thank you for reading. Sources: [1] http://www.hrw.org... [2] http://www.hrw.org... [3] http://abcnews.go.com...

S554eb968-A9ba702b0	Taxes should be raised on the rich	"First, I want to point out what I will and will NOT be arguing. I will be arguing that taxation is good for the economy, that taxes on the rich ought to be higher, and that the taxation system it's self is fine, but a few minor adjustments would really help the US start to “boom”. I will NOT argue about the morality of taxes, as this silly idea that somehow taxes are theft ignores two central points: 1) taxes are voluntary, if you do not like the stuff governments fund, you can practice tax resistance in a safe and legal manner, and 2) you get services back for those taxes that are mandatory, which is counter-intuitive to the idea that they're theft (which implies taking without the intent of giving something else to you in return like a good or service). I also wish to point out our current state of affairs with taxes right now, we have 3 types of taxes. 1) an estate tax (getting money when someone dies), 2) ordinary income (making money via an ordinary job) and 3) capital gains (returns on investments, such as stocks, bonds, etc...) bare this in mind as this is key to my argument later in this round. Furthermore, this misconception of “tax brackets” has flawed our understanding of how the tax code actually works today. Most people believe that if you make a certain amount of income, you have to stay below a certain amount otherwise all your money gets lumped into a new tax bracket. It does NOT in fact work this way. Let's say we have a tax rate of 10% (at making $0-17 thousand a year), 15% (17-70k a year), 20% (70-142), and 25% ($142+) Not withstanding tax deductions, if you make 10,000/year you only pay 10% tax. BUT if you make 50k/year, your first 17k is taxed at 10%, the remaining 33k is taxed at 15%, and so on. The current tax rate DOES NOT charge you a rate of 15% for all $50k you make/year. C1: The Fundamental Role of the State is to Implement Policies That Benefit the Community First contention is pretty straight forward. The basic philosophy is that the state may interject in the affairs of the community, only on the basis of it's policies, and if they are beneficial to the community or not. These were noted in the Supreme Court Cases of Muller v Oregon, and West Coast Hotel v Parrish, trying to justify cutting women's working hours and implementing minimum wage. The same goes for taxes. Taxes reallocate funds to the economically alienated, and are also used on behalf of the state for the best interest of the people (as our representatives). Which is why the state does have a basic reason to interject in today’s community, and dictate why people (either artificial or official) must pay taxes. While my opponent will no doubt contend that taxation hurts the economy instead of helping it, but research actually shows this is blatantly untrue. In fact, the Congressional Research Service (a non partisan division for congressional research) found that the core GOP philosophy was outright wrong, and found that in the US when taxes were higher, they spurred economic growth. [http://www.dpcc.senate.gov... ] [http://www.forbes.com...] C2: It is Unfair That Warren Buffet Pays Less Taxes Than His Secretary Based On Our System Today! Indeed, you read that right folks! Warren Buffet noted he pays less taxes than his secretary on his income taxes. This is because the rate of individual taxes varies like in the above example as a progressive taxation rate, meaning they increase progressively. Capital gains taxes are a flat tax of 15%, which means that despite all the income made, that same rate only applies to this case because the person technically made their money in stocks (for example) instead of an actual job working for someone. It seems unfair to me that Warren Buffet (a well noted billionaire) literally pays the same tax rate as the average Joe who makes a simple 50k/year. [http://www.politifact.com...] C3: History Has Shown Us That High Tax Rates Mean An Economically Powerful Country With data collected from the Tax Foundation and a little knowledge of history, I can show you that taxes are actually quite low today than compared to previous times, and furthermore, one case my opponent cannot refute: FDR. First, as the analysis showed “Today's government spending levels are indeed too high, at least relative to the average level of tax revenue the government has generated over the past 60 years. Unless Americans are willing to radically increase the amount of taxes they pay relative to GDP, government spending must eventually be cut. Today's income tax rates are strikingly low relative to the rates of the past century, especially for rich people. For most of the century, including some boom times, top-bracket income tax rates were much higher than they are today. Contrary to what Republicans would have you believe, super-high tax rates on rich people do not appear to hurt the economy or make people lazy: During the 1950s and early 1960s, the top bracket income tax rate was over 90%--and the economy, middle-class, and stock market boomed” [http://www.businessinsider.com...] It continued “Super-low tax rates on rich people also appear to be correlated with unsustainable sugar highs in the economy--brief, enjoyable booms followed by protracted busts. They also appear to be correlated with very high inequality. (For example, see the 1920s and now). Periods of very low tax rates have been followed by periods with very high tax rates, and vice-verse. So history suggests that tax rates will soon start going up.” Indeed, it seems as though taxes ought to be increased on capital gains to spur economic growth, and for fairness in today’s economy. Finally, as I had noted, FDR's presidency is the epitome of what it means to interfere in the market place, while maintaining a solid track-record for economic growth. Unemployment dropped under his leadership from 25% when he takes office to 1.4% in 1945, furthermore, the income tax rates were first applied, they made executive Order 9250 in October 1942, later to be rescinded by Congress, which raised the marginal tax rate for salaries exceeding $25,000 (after tax) to 100%, thereby limiting salaries to $25,000 (about $351,000 today). The ONLY complaint about FDR's policies was the mini-recession taking place in 1937-38, but most economists generally agree that was on behalf of the Treasury's refusal to switch to fiat money and stick to the gold standard (which was NOT FDR's policy). Either way, the New Deal is certainly proof of the economically soundness of tax rates being higher. [http://en.wikipedia.org... ] [http://www.voxeu.org... ] In conclusion: I think we can see now that taxes ought to be raised on the so-called ""rich"" due to it's benefits, and I await my opponents response! Thank you!"	PRO	84
Sda116120-A538a69d7	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	"A simpler tax code The FT is simpler as well as more transparent and fair than the current tax system. We're talking about a 135 page tax code to replace much of the current tax code, which is ridiculously long and with a lot of special interest influence. Corporations spend billions of dollars just to comply with this code, and they pass the entire cost of this onto the consumer, shareholder and employee. Instead of disguising and hiding taxes, the FT puts them right in your face, so you know how much you're paying. "" When considering the impact that FT will have on the economy, wages, inflation and prices the magnitude of that burden is shown to be far more than PRO's made it seem."" Actually I've shown those arguments to be false. 22% of imbedded taxes replaced by 23% taxes, will not cause a significant jump in prices. Inflation will continue at normal levels. Incomes won't rise, but they won't be taxed, so people will have access to more money. Just about every study that comes out shows the economy improving with the FT. It probably has something to do with bringing more money home and becoming the biggest tax haven in the world and this drawing in huge businesses. http://www.fairtax.org... ""Moreover, in positing that FT is simpler, PRO fails to account for the transition costs that necessarily follow from the status quo to the FT's implementation as much as he ignores the logistical problems of collection."" I'm sure transition costs will be offset by the billions of dollars it takes just to figure out how to comply with the current tax system. Some estimates being at 230 billion dollars and up. The fair tax reduces compliance costs by 90% which will more then overcome the transitional costs. http://www.fairtax.org... I'm not sure There is very many logistical problems to be concerned with. 80% of all retail sales go through big box stores such as Wal-Mart. These stores already have systems in place to collect taxes. http://www.fairtax.org... ""massive evasion is inevitable with [FT] because all revenue would be collected at just one point in the entire economic system... final sales."" I don't understand the point massive evasion is inevitable regardless of the tax system. It's probably a lot easier to lie about your income on a w2 than it is to buy a pack of bubblegum at Wal-Mart (big box store where 80% of sales take place) without paying the tax on it. There is this other myth my opponent keeps referring to that is obviously false. It's the statement that the FT in order to claim revenue neutrality assumes 100% of income is spent. In the previous round he changed it from that to 100% compliance. I've pointed out the absurdity of this statement before. My opponent cites a book that proves this statement by citing the President's Advisory Panel on tax reform. The problem is The President's Advisory on Tax Reform researched their own version of the FT with added in exemptions and other things not part of the bill being passed through legislation. So, really my arguments are being attacked by criticism for a national sales tax plan that in no way resembles the FT. http://www.fairtax.org... It's most certainly revenue neutral, and that fact isn't based on some fantasy that the government would be able to gain 100% compliance. More Fairness No Loopholes My opponent asserts that the FT could be abused by politicians to reward special interest groups or punish political enemies. So what he's essentially saying is that because a tax code word revert back to being used for political manipulation, that we should just accept an unfair tax code. I don't buy that. We should replace the unfair tax code with a fair one and then when that one's unfair, we should replace it. To me that's like saying ""don't wash your clothes because they're just going to get dirty again"". We should wash our clothes every time they get dirty and we should fix our tax code every time it breaks. Revenue neutral Skipping the points I've already addressed prior to this round. My opponent argues that your stereotypical Republican and Democrat wouldn't gain anything from a revenue neutral FT. They won't be able to reduce taxes and punish the super rich. I won't argue my opponent there. I think taking power away from politicians to use the tax code for their political agenda is a good thing. My opponent argues once again that the FT's revenue neutrality rests on the assumption that people spend 100% of their income. This is simply no true. I don't know what to say. It's as simple as just plainly being false. http://www.fairtax.org... Look at all the scholarly studies showing the FT to be revenue neutral. You won't see a 100% of income spent assumption and based on the fact that numbers for average savings amount investments etc. are always included, shows that no 100% income spent assumption is used. There is an assumption that a FT at the final sale would discourage people from buying. The FT would actually be included in the price and collected at the point of sale. The 22% imbedded taxes get taken out and the 23% gets added in. The price is added into the product. So when you see a dollar loaf of bread. The 23% tax is already included in it. 23% Tax Burden Let's get this out of the way. When comparing the FT to a sales tax the 30% number is used, but the 23% number is used when comparing it to an income tax. The reason is to show that if you spent all your income 23% would go towards taxes. It's not trickery or sleight of hand it's just different descriptors used to establish a fair comparison rate depending on what it's being compared to. If any of my opponents following arguments sound familiar it's because it's not the first time he made them and he's decided to repeat them instead of address my criticism. "" But even still, the impact to young adults who are in the process of establishing themselves is staggering, in that it unfairly penalizes ""those who may need to borrow and consume heavily... by buying their first cars, first homes and all the furnishings that go with them, and possibly pay for the costs of child rearing as well."" There is 2 issues with this argument. The first is that the 22% of imbedded taxes taken out and replaced with 23% taxes, doesn't show a significantly more of a burden to young adults just getting started. Another thing left out of this argument is the fact that most people just starting out would be buying used cars, homes etc. The FT has virtually no affect on these people. "" Likewise, implementing FT would effectively leverage an insidious form of double taxation on those who saved their income at a time when income was taxed."" They would have already payed the imbedded taxes in products which are being replaced by an almost equivalent amount of FT. The double taxation is a wash. If you account for the fact that they won't have to pay capital gains on investments than it's probably a win. Corporations My opponents arguments against the influx of businesses we'd have as a result of the FT are invalid. I've already shown that being the biggest corporate tax haven in the world would heavily encourage businesses to come here. There is nothing really to defend because my evidence was dismissed without a rebuttal. My argument still stands. Corporations will flock here and the economy will grow. Banking My opponent claims that, the rich would go overseas to buy luxury products. This is simply not the case. Seeing as how prices would remain the same on products the rich will have just as much incentive as they always have had to take their business elsewhere. Prebate/Welfare My opponent is concerned about a cost of living not being attract chef to the prebate. This poverty level spending rebate is better than what we have now. Right now a poor person paying 0% in income tax is still paying the 22% on everything else. In the FT system this person wouldn't pay that imbedded tax either up to poverty level spending. Asking for the prebate to take into account the difference in cost of living from area to area isn't reasonable. For one it's better than what we have now so pointing out that it could be better doesn't help con's case, but other than that the cost and abuse of adjusting the prebate to match each varying cost of living isn't necessary. Cost of living can vary from one neighborhood to the next and calculating all these different variables just isn't going to happen for any tax system. ""I didn't say that 100% of income is taxed under FT, I said that FT is revenue neutral only if 100% of income ""is consumed"" meaning 100% is spent on taxable goods and services. As I've said before, that's just not the case. "" I think you knew what I meant. 100% of income isn't assumed to be spent on taxable goods and services. This is just a complete fabrication. Every study you'll look at (some I've included) shows that it's assumed that less than 100% of income will be spent on taxable goods and services. http://www.fairtax.org...

Sdd22a6ba-Ab6a6a9ff	Gay marriage should be illegal	"I'll start with a quote, from Justice Anthony Kennedy who best phrased the case against discrimination against homosexuals: ""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were . . . [M]arriage embodies a love that may even endure past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. [We must] grant them that right."" [16] Rebuttal (1) Harm principle My mention of religion doesn't significantly impact my argument, since I clearly mentioned that ""a gay couple marrying does not affect an individual's beliefs at all."" Regardless of whether those beliefs are religious, the *same* standard applies. Just because a person doesn't like it does not mean it is actually harmful to that person. Also extend Lawrence v. Texas, which ruled that an individual's conception of morality is not sufficient to implement law. The happiness caused by same-sex marriage easily outweighs this. Note that Pro concedes the application of the harm principle as a framework in this debate, and merely holds that gay marriage causes harm. As such, the lens of the debate as a whole is to see whether the harm caused by gay marriage outweighs the benefit. Through this debate, Pro has incorrectly held that the harms of the status quo outweigh the benefits. I've shown that to be objectively wrong, and will continue to affirm the mentioned position through this round. (2) Discrimination Pro entirely misinterprets my argument regarding his source. I agreed with his source insofar as the standard to judge discrimination is based on the irrationality of the same. And I have proven time and again in this debate that it is just as irrational to discriminate based on sex as it is based on race. Pro *drops* that heteronormativity enforces gender roles. Pro then brings up new evidence of infidelity (when all he talked about previously was open relationships). Don't consider because: (a) per debate convention, new arguments or evidence cannot be presented in the final round, and (b) Pro still fails to explain how infidelity or unfaithfulness is *bad* or in any way undermines the equality of same-sex relationships. I brought up the lack of coherence of such a claim in previous rounds, and Pro *drops* it all. Pro's rebuttal to my psychological argument is nonsense. Pro picks up a quote from my source, and the quote merely says, based on its results, it supports same-sex marriage. That is not bias. ""Bias"" is holding the conclusion and then finding justification for that conclusion. The study finds premises, and gains the *conclusion* to keep same-sex marriage legal. Pro doesn't explain how my source is biased, while I've shown that it is a reliable peer-reviewed studies. Pro also doesn't explain how believing in the idea that same-sex marriage should be legal undermines the conclusion that discrimination causes psychological damage to gay couples. (3) Economics (a) Pro's response to marriage privatization is entirely *new,* so it should not be considered under any circumstances. For the purposes of fairness and by debate convention, new arguments in the final speech aren't permitted. (b) Pro straw-mans my case. I'm not advocating marriage privatization. I'm saying Pro's *own* case seems to indicate that. Furthermore, just because Congress and the candidates haven't considered it does not mean it should be considered. This is a classic is/ought fallacy. Just because it *is* not considered doesn't mean it *should* not be considered. (c) Pro drops that he is arbitrarily applying the economics standard to same-sex marriage without doing the same to opposite-sex couples. Even banning opposite-sex marriage (i.e. privatizing it) would benefit the economy, but Pro is only advocating for the ban of same sex marriage (which is basically the same as privatizing it, i.e. not acknowledging government benefits to those couples). So Pro is actually advocating for privatization of same-sex marriage *alone* without applying the same standard to anything else. Vote Pro down on this inconsistency. (d) If you see my last round, you'll know that my source *also* addresses all other forms of weighing mechanisms, including housing taxes. Let's look at the definition of the term ""marriage penalty."" ""A marriage penalty or bonus is the change in a couple's total tax bill as a result of getting married and thus filing their taxes jointly."" [17] The usage of the term by Pro's source is merely the usual understanding of it, not the universal one. I was referring to it as any tax penalty caused by filing taxes together. (e) Pro *drops* the long-term economic benefits, including benefits to businesses and reducing unemployment, which link turn Pro's case. (4) Right to marriage (a) Pro, once again, *drops* that this is defense, not offense. Extend that it doesn't provide a positive reason to vote Pro. (b) I've clearly addressed Pro's bad arguments on psychological damage. His accusations of bias in my source hold no ground. Note that the bias accusation is also a new argument, since I brought up psychological damage earlier as well. (c) Pro largely drops my point about there being no relevant differences between men and women. The existence of women-only night clubs doesn't prove anything, since it is an is/ought fallacy. A women-only night club *is* sexist. It doesn't provide a reason for denying that sexism is a form of discrimination. Pro fails to prove there is a rational basis for basing different actions depending on one's gender. (5) Morality (a) Pro basically drops this, because ""inferior love"" has nothing to do with morality. Pro argued from morality without applying a clear moral standard by which to judge how coherent a claim of right or wrong is. (b) Pro says this is irrelevant. I'm perfectly fine if Pro thinks that, because it was *him* who argued this, not me. All Pro does to defend this is to re-assert his position, which isn't sufficient because I provided a clear refutation of his source and Regnerus's study. (c) I did make this point, but that doesn't make it relevant. It is irrelevant anyhow, and shouldn't imapct Pro's victory. Pro also drops this, and, therefore, concedes this by omission. (d) Pro hasn't proven any differences. This is clearly addressed above -- Pro's argument regarding night clubs is irrelevant, and other ""proofs"" have been substantially refuted by me. (e) Pro just *asserts* that his sources are right after dropping my elaborate refutations of those sources. He hasn't proven that his studies are valid. He offers a new source, which I shall analyze. This is merely a study that shows that homosexuality is not *entirely* genetic. This doesn't mean it is a choice. Furthermore, the study presumes that identical twins are genetically identical. It is a demonstrable fact that that is false. [18] Conclusion There's no reasonable way in which Pro wins this debate. Pro has essentially dropped most of my case in this previous round, and has failed to address most of my points. Here's why I win this debate: (1) I've shown that not legalizing gay marriage promotes discrimination, both LGBT discrimination and general sexism by reinforcing the idea of gender roles. I've also shown that this causes severe psychological damage, including clinical depression. (2) Pro's economic argument is turned with both its links and impacts. It arbitrarily applies a standard to same-sex couples while not applying it to opposite-sex couples, and I've shown that the economic benefits of the status quo easily outweigh the harms to the status quo that Pro brings up. (3) I've torn down Pro's notion that marriage isn't a universally applicable right, and shown how discrimination isn't a positive at all. (4) Pro doesn't explain how same-sex love is ""inferior"" due to infidelity or open relationships, fails to establish a coherent moral framework, fails to demonstrate successfully that homosexuality is a choice, and fails to explain how homosexuals make worse parents (and even concedes my point regarding the latter). [Sidenote: per the rules of this debate, Pro must leave the last round blank except to post ""no round as agreed."" If he violates that rule, voters should not read that round of Pro's since it is in explicit violation of the rules. Even a small conclusion isn't allowed.] The economic benefits, prevention of psychological harms, and lack of discrimination in the status quo easily outweigh Pro's only standing, small impact of economic benefits which is also arbitrary and seems to argue against his own position. For those reasons, and for the reasons outlined above, Vote Con. [16] Obergefell v. Hodges, 567 U.S. ____ (2015) [17] http://taxfoundation.org... [18] http://www.livescience.com..."	CON	86

S9d5a13c2-A9d2e0eef	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	"I accept with some reservations. Firstly, I'd like to point out that Pro is upholding the status quo, while I am trying to change that. Therefore, I have BOP in this case, unless pro advocates for abolishing Minimum wage entirely. I do not think that is his case, and thus I have BOP. The only reason why I am not making a case right now is due to the rules, otherwise with standard debate conventions I would be here. Secondly, I'd like to point out that I'm on debate dot org doing this debate. I think at this point it's well noted that I'm at a distinct disadvantage to that of my opponent who is a well noted Republican HOF'er, and that this website is well noted for favoring Republican ideology. I only ask, that instead of using the bias to dictate who did and did not win, that we remove it and only go by the merits of the debate it's self rather than ones bias. Thirdly, I also ask that we consider sources. I think that it isn't unreasonable to ask that the sources be considered for the audience due to how much ""junk"" is used on the internet to justify a position. I think we can agree to dismiss heavy partisan sources as illegitimate here today. Citing fox news or MSNBC for the impacts of minimum wage shouldn't be used here due to their intense bias'. Finally, I think it's important to note that internationally, New Zeland was the first country to impliment a minimum wage in the international community. While I agree with my opponent that we should assume the context of this debate takes place in the US, I think I ought to point out that the impacts of other countries in a similar situation to the US (mostly wealthy developed countries as well) ought to be considered legitimate as a form of a ""controlled"" experiment should the debaters wish to do so. A minimum wage is the lowest hourly, daily or monthly remuneration that employers may legally pay to workers. Equivalently, it is the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labor. should - Used to indicate obligation, duty, or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions: ""he should have been careful"". Indicating a desirable or expected state: ""by now students should be able to read"". Fast food - Fast food is the term given to food that can be prepared and served very quickly, first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered to be fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. And with those notes, I accept the debate challenge I wish my opponent the best of luck within this debate. Let's get it on!"	CON	88
S3cd3a05e-A55d12b5b	Governments should value economic equality before prosperity	"I thank my opponent for his rebuttals. In this round I shall answer his contentions and defend my own. Ruling elite Assuming that the government does not print money (which makes everybody poor and is thus not very conductive to prosperity), one person having more money means that another person has less. That's the problem with my opponent on one hand saying that the accumulation of wealth is important, and that on the other hand poverty eradication is also important - one person accumulating wealth is the source of another person's poverty. If you want to eradicate poverty, you have to deal with one person or group controlling too many scarce resources, which is the inevitable result if money is concentrated into the hands of only a few ""haves"" instead of a majority of ""have nots"". The prosperous society he describes is one governed by a ruling elite - both because control of money means control of resources, allowing certain individuals to regulate who gets what, and because with wealth comes the power to lobby governments to certain ends. The excuse my opponent gave you for why poverty is OK is essentially that poor people don't invest. Companies get their money primarily through two channels: investment and consumer spending. Poor people are bad at the former, but brilliant at the latter. What you'd find if there was more equality in the world is that companies who provide food, clothing and other necessities would have a lot more wealth to help more poor people, while companies who provide luxuries like private jets are likely to have a lot less to help rich people. The point is that companies are still getting income for things like large capital projects - only from a different source, and by different means - if governments choose equality over prosperity. My opponent claims that the redistribution of wealth must be by a ruling class, using North Korea as an example. He then goes on to defeat his own example by showing that North Korea is actually a very unequal society. The existance of a ruling class is proof that a government cares for prosperity over equality, despite what that government's rhetoric may be. It is perfectly possible to institute a fair and objective system for redistributing wealth, and yet these governments refuse. An example would be progressive income tax, where earning more means you pay a higher tax rate. That's not redistributing according to elitist values, that's redistributing according to an objective measure. If the government ""redistributers"" started to become wealthy, then they would be taxed at the higher rate too. In this way they don't control the resources either. Why aim for equality? I will agree that income has diminishing returns on happiness. What this means is that my opponent's evidence shows that prosperity beyond some basic level becomes increasingly futile. By comparison, the impact that the same marginal amount of income has on a poor family is much greater. My opponent's evidence is entirely consistant with my observation that equality leads to happiness - indeed, it supports it, because it shows that happiness would not have been increased as much through more prosperity than with more equality. But happiness is only half of the picture. My other contention was that equality leads to prosperity. I gave two paragraphs of analysis on ""The Great Prosperity Experiment"", and my opponent didn't see fit to answer any of it. All he tells us is that investment and entrepreneurship (which relies on investment) leads to prosperity because the Legatum Institute said so. That's no surprise, because the ""Legatum Institute"" is actually a division of The Legatum Group (http://www.legatum.com...), a capital investment group. So basically a capital investment group is saying that their services will bring prosperity. This is spin that just shouldn't be believed. Equality does not diminish wealth I agree correlation does not prove causation. What proves causation is my paragraph of unresponded-to economic analysis on why the figures show such a strong correlation between equality and prosperity, which stated that equality provides incentives for investment and for achievement. Free markets provide no incentives for either. Con asserts rich people have reason to invest in a free market, and yet his own data shows they have relatively little happiness to gain as a result, and a lot of happiness to lose, meaning that in a free market the incentive is not to invest. In an equal market, there is consumer expenditure substituting investment (as the poor spend relatively more of their income) and incentive for international expansion, as I showed last round. To distract from this analysis, my opponent provides three counter-examples. On the United States, he explains more inequality was often correlated with less poverty. This is because he has defined poverty in terms of outputs, such as food and housing. The Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality shows that while output in GDP per worker has increased massively in the US, the median income hasn't increased a bit since 1970 (http://www.stanford.edu...). That's bad because there has been significant inflation since that time, so in terms of purchasing power, US poverty has increased massively. Poverty has not decreased, or remained the same. It has increased at more or less the rate of inflation, while inequality has certainly increased. On China and India, my opponent says that they have recently become more prosperous and open. To some extent, the size of a market determines the potential for returns in relatively equal societies (like China and India used to be), meaning that when these countries opened up to foreign investment (NOT free markets or deregulation like my opponent always asserts - in fact China has particularly non-free markets, such as their currency market), there was a lot of investment. It will take some time before issues of poverty in China mean investment slows, and we're already seeing the first signs of that. For instance, Apple's scandel when workers at the Foxconn factory at Zhengzhou suicided will inevitably mean investors will be more cautious about moving into China, and even the US government has expressed some concern (http://www.bbc.com...). In addition, what incentive do these workers have for entrepreneurship, or to increase their productivity? None. Their lack of equality has diminished their real wealth, just as it did when communists caused the famines there under a five-year plan to improve prosperity. Now let's turn to my awesome examples, which didn't include anyone in Scandinavia so I'll ignore that bit. I gave the example of the Netherlands, my opponent did not respond. I gave the example of Luxembourg, and my opponent blamed that on the attractiveness of their industries. Their efforts to redistribute wealth are in their highest-in-the-world minimum wage, which I cited and my opponent ignored. Their industries are attractive because of the significant foreign investment there. Why? Well, as your source says, it's mostly because of the positive labour relations. And why's that? One word - equality. Of course people will be happy workers if they're equal, that's what I've been proving time and time again. The great prosperity experiment is a failure. Equality should be the future."	PRO	89
Scde43845-A7d302d24	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Comparative Advantage Con quotes economist Krugman [Con's ref 1, C1] that trade reduces the wages of many in the U.S. So is Krugman opposed to free trade? Krugman says, ""So am I arguing for protectionism? No. Those who think that globalization is always and everywhere a bad thing are wrong. On the contrary, keeping world markets relatively open is crucial to the hopes of billions of people."" [C1] Krugman is arguing that dislocations should be ameliorated by government. As a leftist, he argues that welfare should be given to displaced workers; right-wingers generally argue that aid should be given in retraining. Krugman said that ""perhaps most"" workers in the U.S. might have reduced wages. That cannot be squared with over 80% of workers being in industries not subject to foreign competition. Moreover, trade effects are transient. Consider those workers sewing underwear in North Carolina. Foreign competition puts competitive pressure on the business, driving he wages of underwear sewers down. What happens is that the economy reacts to move capital from labor intensive textile manufacturing to other areas. In North Carolina, pharmaceuticals and high tech were alternatives. Government attempts to support non-competitive textiles prolong the dislocation. Con claims that there is growing consensus among economists that the theory of comparative advantage is wrong. Really? I provided data that over 90% of economists agree the theory is correct. The 9% who do not agree are not a consensus, and there is no evidence their numbers are growing. Paul Krugman agrees with Milton Friedman the theory is valid. Free trade leads to displacements. Progress of all types leads to displacements. Computer printers have destroyed the market for typewriters, displacing all the workers who made typewriters. The remedy for the displacements by progress or by free trade is the same: shift jobs to competitive industries. Germany has a positive trade balance, and much of their positive balance is from manufactured goods. The Germans manufacture things that require high levels of worker skill. U.S. Trade Deficits The reasons that the U.S. runs chronic trade deficits include: A policy of unlimited immigration of unskilled labor with tight restrictions on skilled labor A basic education system that provides high school graduates who cannot read well or do mat A higher education system with students who spend on 14 hours a week studying [10. http://www.boston.com...] and in which useful professions are downplayed in favor of liberal arts A policy of not developing oil resources; despite having three times the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia [11. http://articles.mercola.com...], we choose to import rather than export An entitlement system so pervasive that for many people work is optional Government overspending that takes capital out of productive enterprise Protectionism solves none of these policy problems. These are policies that inevitably lower wages. High tariffs make matters worse by subsidizing inefficient production. Comparative advantage is always beneficial, but to yield strong positive trade balances government policies must favor a first-world economy, and they do not. Con points to the Federal budget deficits as a looming problem and attributes the problem to free trade. Not one penny of the Federal deficit is owed as payment for goods or services bought from outside the United States. The Federal deficit is due entirely to the Federal government spending more than it takes in, not buying foreign goods. The deficit is indeed a monstrous problem, but wild deficits are run independent of free trade policies. Con complains that half of the traded government debt is owned by foreigners. (The non-traded debt is basically money the government creates.) the government could refuse to let foreigners buy Treasuries, That would dramatically raise interest rates because all the money would have to be sucked out of the U.S. economy as government competes with private industry for the available capital. Con claims I agreed that free trade caused the deficits. I did not. In what Con references I cited the size of the trade deficit to the total economy. The Federal deficit is not a part of that equation. Con sites several studies that claim that the economy would have grown much faster if there were no trade deficits. The studies only assert that having deficits is bad, which is true. However, protectionism would make the economy worse than it now is rather than better. By illustration, if we all agree that tornadoes are bad, that does not endorse buying an expensive magic amulet to ward them off. Tornadoes would remain bad and we would be out still more money. That trade deficits are bad is an argument for fixing the list of policies that make the country less competitive. The Germans do it; we choose not to. Con argues that the US exports substantial quantities of non-renewable resources. He must be referring to out vast oil exports. No wait, we are importing oil. We export lots of timber. That's renewable. So what? No one likes pollution, not even Communists. Prosperity from trade provides the money to fight it. Con argues that if the price of imports go down, the price of exported goods must go up. If so, then if we import underwear then the price of airliners, a major export, must go up. That's not true because the airliner market is competitive just like the underwear market. We are better off because we can compete more profitably in the airliner market, not because the prices rise. In fact, prices for airliners drop because a competitive market forces innovation and efficiency, while protected industries languish. that's why Hindustani Motors did not prosper and Toyota did. Counter theories Con's later references [C5. C6] work from a wrong scenario. They assume that if cheap goods are allowed in domestic manufacturers must lower wages to compete. That makes the evil manufacturers richer, because they pay lower wages, but the larger number of worker suffer from lower wages. The error is that manufacturers do not continue in non-competitive industries, they abandon them in favor of competitive industries. Textiles are discontinued in favor of pharmaceuticals, or whatever. Data supporting the erroneous theory can be mined from industries in the process of being phased out. The textile industry does not die overnight in the face of foreign competition. Typically governments try to keep them alive with various tax subsidies and public expenditures. During that time the workers will have the lower wages. manufacturers will be on an upward trend as capital is moved to more profitable domestic or overseas operations. Our government should get ahead of the changes. America's future is not in sewing underwear. Anticipating the long term outcome, policies of education and taxation should be aimed at aiding transition. Or at least government could not fight it. Trade promotes peace Free trade benefits both sides of the trading partnership. ""... in 1748, Baron de Montesquieu observed that 'Peace is the natural effect of trade. Two nations who differ with each other become reciprocally dependent; for if one has an interest in buying, the other has an interest in selling; and thus their union is founded on their mutual necessities.'"" [11. http://www.csmonitor.com...] Con offered no counter. Evidence It's easy to catalog examples of free trade working, as Friedman did. If the theory were wrong, then Hong Kong and Singapore should be failures, and China better off in Maoist trade isolation. Con avoids discussing the great and numerous examples. Academicians instead focus on the U.S. economy and try to make a case that the failures from wrong policies in education and government are somehow due to free trade."	PRO	90
Sdd22a6ba-Aa17d0a64	Gay marriage should be illegal	"== Rebuttal == R1) Harm principle A single religion cannot enforce its beliefs on non-consensual others either. Here, the religious believers are also causing harm, and the government is infringing on a liberty for appeasement. Appeasement isn't sufficient to constitute as ""harm"" for the government to ban something. Furthermore, this debate is *not* about whether schools should teach children about gay marriage -- I could even disagree with the court and still affirm the resolution. This debate is about the legality of gay marriage alone, and nothing else. A gay couple marrying doesn't affect an individual's beliefs at all. Just because a person doesn't like it does not mean it is actually harmful to that person. As long as it doesn't affect that person, vote Con. Furthermore, I'm not necessarily arguing this as hardcore offense -- I'm merely asserting that the default position in this debate is to support my side. I also fully concede that budgets are important and constitute a violation of pleasure; so the point of contention will be entirely topical to that argument. R2) Discrimination Pro's argument formatting is messed up, but I'll still take it from Pro's source. Pro's source simply says this: discrimination is only considered ""discrimination"" if there's no rational basis for the differential treatment, and that denying gay marriage has a rational basis for the denial. The former proposition is one I agree with, and one I outlined in my argument already. The second part, though, is typical con-gay marriage nonsense. There is absolutely no rational basis for denying gay marriage. The economic argument, for instance, is fully impact turned, because it suggests that marriage privatization is the best way to go, which would mean allowing gay marriage; it also seems to irrationally differentiate between gay marriage and opposite-sex marriage, failing to justify why the former should be banned but not the latter (when there are more opposite-sex marriages). There's no unique benefit to banning gay marriage. The benefits Pro presents are addressed below. The source also says something about ""redefining marriage,"" which isn't a clear harm. Pro asks how acknowledging heteronormativity enforces gender roles. Banning gay marriage is equal to saying the only true marriage is one with both a man and a woman, which is creating a social difference between them. This categorization is essentially the root of gender roles and sexism. There isn't any unique benefit to this, but all it does is make a social difference between men and women, thus treating them differently. Treating them differently and classifying them based on that (when the only differences are biological, which is no rational basis to differentiate) is essentially what sexism is. Furthermore, extend that this categorization causes psychological harm. Psychological damage is the strongest impact in this debate, because we're judging from a utilitarian standard, in which psychological damage includes things like clinical depression. Depression is among the worst forms of suffering, and being denied marriage can cause that. It has been demonstrated that allowing gay marriage reduces depression and similar psychological issues. [11] Pro then argues that ""homosexual love is not equal,"" because of greater rates of unfaithfulness -- specifically, via open relationships, by Pro's own R1 source. Open relationships means both partners accept it. Since Pro accepts my utilitarian framework, it means there is no pain and only pleasure caused by this. Which means open relationships don't render homosexual relationships ""unequal."" Pro fails to demonstrate how this forms a rational basis for inequality. R3) Economic harms (1) Pro *drops* that this is a non-unique benefit. Extend that Pro doesn't explain how same-sex marriage should be banned because of this, rather than opposite-sex marriage or generally marriage privatization. Also extend that Pro's own logic would mean marriage privatization is the best course, under which gay marriage would be legal. This turn dooms Pro's argument. (2) I accept that there would be some impact on tax money. But that would be *outweighed* by the other benefits. Pro addresses Stevenson by highlighting some tax exemptions for gay couples. But that doesn't show poor calculations by Stevenson, because the study *also* weighs marriage penalties. There are marriage bonuses and marriage penalties. Pro highlights some of the bonuses, and his source only says they *exist.* It doesn't talk about whether marriage penalties outweigh them. Stevenson's study actually *addresses* marriage bonuses and says marriage penalties *outweigh* them totally. [Note: I would like to correct my last round; I accidentally typed $20 to $40 ""billion,"" when it should be ""million.""] (3) Pro claims the other benefits are all ""short term ones."" He is wrong. The business benefit is, according to the studies, a *long term* benefit, since the marriage business will gain a lot of money, create more jobs, and allow more tax payment to the government. Revenue will significantly increase anyway. Also extend the argument from safety net programs: marriage will make people relatively financially secure (due to a working spouse, for instance) and that will mean less government spending on welfare and other safety net programs. R4) Right to marriage (1) Extend that this is a defense, not an offense. It doesn't provide a positive reason to vote Pro. Pro drops this point entirely. (2) I'm not saying it ""should apply to everyone."" I'm saying if there's a benefit being provided to a certain group of people while being denied to another group of people with no rational basis to it, *then* it should be extended to the latter group as well. There's no question that marriage is a benefit. It allows for greater psychological well-being. [11] It also allows people to balance work between each other, thus creating more financial security. If both people in a couple earn an income each, then there naturally would be a greater income. Marriage poses a significant benefit, and it is illogical to deny that benefit to same-sex couples, especially when -- with regards to their resolving issues between each other better than opposite-sex couples, and similar things -- they often reap the benefits of marriage *better* than opposite-sex couples. [12] R5) Morality (1) Pro is confusing the meaning of claiming something is immoral and establishing a moral framework. All Pro's argument did, from R1, is that it claimed gay marriage is immoral because of a certain set of reasons. It doesn't establish *why* those reasons are immoral. For example, Pro claims same-sex couples are often more unfaithful, but doesn't explain how it is *immoral* for them to be unfaithful. Also extend that Pro doesn't prove that the government should legislate based on what is moral as opposed to what is desirable. The United States currently rejects legislation based solely on moral concerns. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court ruled that it isn't just going to make something law based on moral concerns -- it has to pass through *some* form of benefit/harm review. (2) Pro's first source (source 4) regarding this is *not* a study, so it does not represent the research here. Pro says he has ""studies that show this,"" but the first link he sources isn't even a study. Pro's source 5 doesn't even deal with gay marriage. There are only four mentions of the word ""parenting,"" and they are with regards to parenting by a single parent. They have nothing to do with same-sex parents. Pro is merely source-mining. Source 6 argues that the samples made by the majority of studies are wrong -- but the article doesn't mention the studies I cited. The article also cites a study by the NFSS. That study is a bad one. The NFSS study has multiple problems. It examines children who witnessed their parents having a same-sex relationship, but it doesn't at all consider the *duration* of the relationship, and many other major factors. In fact, Mark Regnerus -- the scientist who carried out the study -- admitted under questioning that ""only two of the subjects in his study were raised from birth by committed same-sex couples and both had positive outcomes."" [13] (3) Baking a cake is irrelevant -- that is with regards to anti-discrimination laws. This debate is about same-sex marriage, not anti-discrimination laws. Furthermore, happiness matters insofar as it is weighed against the suffering/sadness caused, and I've already proven with my sources [4] and [11] that non-recognition of the sexual orientation of homosexuality itself, and similar discrimination, causes psychological damage. (4) Pro says there are enormous differences between men and women, which is why non-recognition of same-sex marriage isn't discrimination. This is nonsense. The differences between men and women only matter to society as much as the differences between people of different races. That's why sexism is considered as bad as racism. (5) Pro says homosexuality is a choice, and people who choose to be homosexual are merely making themselves victims of discrimination. But Pro's sources are bad ones. Source [7] is merely a media article of an ""admission,"" which doesn't match peer-reviewed research. Source [8] says homosexuals are not *born* homosexual, which is *not* identical to saying it isn't a choice -- environmental factors that influence homosexuality are also non-consensual. Finally, source [9] merely represents the individual views of a person, and is an appeal to authority. On the other hand, scientific consensus suggests that homosexuality isn't a choice.

Sed146d2b-A153005ef	Taxes should be Significantly Cut	"Taxes are justifiable: Taxes are justifiable and needed. First, the taxes we pay are used to pay for infrastructure, our legal system, educational resources, and economic opportunities that allow people to make a lot of wealth in the first place. Second, providing for our social programs and our safety net raises the overall standard of living in the nation, allowing for more productive employees, a larger number of active consumers, greater entrepreneurship, and a much more dynamic economy overall. Therefore, the wealthy, having done in life with help with society, they can afford to give back to society, and have a moral obligation to do so. Income Tax: Income tax cuts don't have real evidence that it stimulates the economy. The main reason is because during poor economic times, people save more than they spend, and so only deficits will increase, and job growth will be meager at best. Look at the comparisons between the Bush Tax Cuts and the Bill Clinton Income taxes. During Bill Clinton's presidency, the economy was vibrant. Even after the tech bubble popped, economic growth was still strong. [2] After the Bush Tax Cuts, job growth was meager, and made the deficits come about again. [1] [3] [4] Tax cuts are also unfair, with the rich tax cuts not helping the economy the same way as middle class tax cuts. The rich tend to invest in stocks and in financial securities, not buying products and investing in new factories. [4] Plus, the rich pay 35% of their income in taxes, which is fair, see my view on top. Plus, with capital gains taxes accounting for much of the wealthy's income, they only have to pay 15% in many cases. Concluding, tax cuts are not helpful in poor economic times, because they fail to truly strenghten the economy and increase the deficit. Social programs are also eliminated, and you hurt millions of people this way and weaken American households by eliminating the safety net. America needs a stronger future with equal entrepreunerial opportunities. Plus, the top 20% in the USA receive 61% of the total income in America. [7] National Sales Tax We argree here. I do not support a national sales tax, and if one shall exist, it should be small. Still, this is administered by the states, and I don't think the federal government should dictate the states on what their taxes on sales should be. Plus, the sales tax reduces inflation. Payroll Taxes This is an interesting topic. You are ignoring the societal consequences of eliminating Social Security. You only mentioned Social Security, so I will center my argument around this program. First, if you allow workers to withdraw from the program, nearly all of the rich will exempt out of this program because they do not yield. However, then the millions of poor and middle class suffer because of a lack of funds. Then you see the negatives of exemption. The government should help make a broad prosperity in America occur. With social security, literally 11 million people are taken out of poverty (among elderly). [8] This strongly helps the economy, and helps small businesses, who have already receieved payroll tax cuts. Consensus: A broad prosperity that makes America stronger and helps society should be maintained. Property and Estate Taxes About Property taxes, YOUR SOURCE shows support for property taxes. He says at the local level that they are efficient. The source is opposed to a state-wide property tax, saying it is inefficient. I think that a compromise, perhaps among counties would be good idea. About estate taxes, your claims are unsupported. It prevents all capital from being consolidated to a few families. More important, is that many do not pay any estate taxes at all. In 2009, 99.75% of estates payed NO estate tax. The notion that this prevents the poor from gaining wealth is ridiculous. [9] Excise Taxes If they are sold underground, it does not relate to the resolution. If they are being sold, they initially payed the excise tax. Plus, the excise taxes reduces the likelihood that people engage in dangerous/ poor behaviors. The reason this tax is Constitutional is because it the Constitution grants Congress to ""lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States."" Corporate Taxes I think that your logic is somewhat off. Currently business' profits in the USA is over $1.6 trillion dollars. [10] However, the businesses are not reacting by increasing employment and reinvestment. Compare this to the Stimulus package. It cut taxes on 95% of working families. [11] However, you don't see a boom, a rush seeing consumers spending their new funds on products. This proves my logic: tax cuts don't increase stimulate the economy in poor times. However, I still do favor a reform of Corporate taxes. I think that, since Corporate taxes are already high in the USA compared to the rest of the world, unlike taxes on the wealthy (we are low compared), I think Corporate taxes should be cut by 10%, to 25%. Then, eliminate all of the loopholes, and the tax code will be more efficient, more businesses will be willing to move to the USA, and tax revenues will continue to be stable, instead of eliminated. Gas and Carbon Taxes The goal of gas taxes is to improve transportation infrastructure. They are critical for having a flourishing economy, and with poor ways of moving goods, a nation will suffer. However, this tax is regressive - it hurts the poor more than anyone else. Perhaps a better method of improving infrastructure could come. About carbon taxes, I have no opinion, but am not for them. I support Cap and Trade as an alternative. Plus, global warming is real, I looked at your source and it was seriously biased. A decreasing majority? ONLY 97% of climate scientists belive global warming is man made. [12] I have much more reasons why global warming exists and is man made, but that is not the discussion topic. Plus, I will answer my opponent's question about taxes in the comments. --- I believe that loopholes can be mostly eliminated, and rates can slightly drop as well. The rich can pay their true fair share. Corporate taxes can be lowered by some, and all loopholes eliminated. Conclusion: Taxes should be kept the same for the most part. The USA has a revenue problem as well as a spending problem. Right now taxes collected is only 14.8% of GDP. In the 1980s, it was 18.2%. There is no evidence that tax cuts will improve the economy. The richest americans (top 400) pay less than the middle class at an average of 18.11%. all: [13] Is this fair? My opponent is saying so. America needs to have a stronger future and the government can facilitate a better, higher prosperity in this nation. Sources: [1] http://www.thefiscaltimes.com...

S5d12ad-Aab22b207	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	"On the Questions] NOTE I linked a wiki because it's common knowledge. This isn't something that I do not need factual, verifiable proof of a scientific study for. There are multiple levels of prison in accordance to the crime committed. This is how the system works and was stating it in general. I honestly didn't even need a source for that seeing as how the topic was prison-based. ""What this means? In some instances, the 90% are perfectly liable to be raped by those who have been in for a while. Therefore my contention of AIDS being spread back to society holds, though it is slightly diminished."" Well it meant that there are different prison systems for different levels of crime. Also the assumption that the 90% is innocent is baseless if you make the point of recidivism. I was just pointing out that that people who get out of prison within a couple of years will not have the tendency to rape ""due to lack of sex"". C) My opponent just wasted the best opportunity he had. There was no proof, no logic, and no link to rape being caused by lack of sex. The statement of ""I already refuted that"" is being dishonest. Here is the quote he is referring to: ""Offering prostitutes to inmates would nearly wipe out prison rape. The reason most inmates turn to rape is because of years without sex. In their desperation, inmates turn to people of the same gender, something they wouldn't ordinarily do. Understanding of this desperation and loneliness by other inmates makes gay rape much more acceptable, often being dressed up as a status type of thing"" -Pro Again, there is no logic or proof in that, just a baseless assumption that lack of sex would cause rape. I think both I and the audience will agree, that's oversimplifying a very complex subject(rape). -This eventually leads into everything else, which has it's own problems show below. [On Disagreements] A)""If you want, but we all have to recognize that a recently released prisoner with AIDS is not likely to survive."" -Pro I agree with the logic that anyone with a disease has less chance at surviving. However again, universal healthcare would be the better option here. [Note] Pro really just had to link a statistic on disease deaths from prisoners being released. That would have been hands down the easiest way to explain the point better than ""people with disease have it harder"" and appealing to the audience that most likely have their own problems in life.. [Prostitution is Illegal] Again, the hypocritical argument of another hypocrisy makes all hypocrisy ok is invalid. I don't have to argue the difference between African American and Native American compensation. It's irrelevant. The point was that both were compensated and if you wanted to make the assumption that one act of unfair compensation by comparison is ok then any hypocrisy is, you are wrong. ""I believe that as long as the government very clearly explained why this wouldn't be hypocritical, like I have, then there wouldn't be any issue. And even if some people still thought it was BS, is that enough to stop this? Is that what you say to someone who's getting raped hundreds of times a year in prison, ""Sorry we didn't want to upset people""?"" I can sum this up to naivety and the appeal to emotion fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org... It's naive to think that the American public would ever support prostitution and appealing to emotion to support an unproven system because people are being harmed in the current one. [Cost and Realistic Approach] A) Missed the point. The money could help more people spent elsewhere. D) Already refuted(I'm repeating myself here). 2. My opponent tries to make an appeal that because people are being raped his system is therefore the best one and the only one we should use. It's a fallacy. [Problem Solved] 1. My opponent has not proved why people are raped in prison and keeps making baseless assumptions, presumably influenced by his societal position. NOTE: This is the third time he has not proved why people commit rape in prison and chalks up a very complex subject to his baseless assumption that it is due to lack of sex and loneliness. Example: ""On the outside you've got those creeps that are interested in feeling more powerful than their victim, and we see the kind of numbers they rack up. But in jail, the number is much higher, and there's the difference that they spend many years alone from the opposite sex. Logically, this added factor will then play a large hand in the increase of rapes. This loneliness has led to a culture that is very comfortable with rape as a necessary thing, adding to its widespread occurrence. Prostitution would wipe out that loneliness and that necessity."" [More Flaws] 1. My opponent assumes that separating people would not prevent rape or the spread of AIDS through rape. He is wrong. 2. My opponent is right. I have nothing to back my claim up with, this was a parody that shows neither does my opponent have reasonable scenario. 3. My opponent suggest making a prostitute sign a waiver so that if the system treats her unfairly she cannot sue. 4. My opponent does not explain how prostitutes would be paid/supported through this system. 5 My opponent makes the rather naive assumption that people would care about prison rape and would implement prostitutes because of it. 6. My opponent rather naively thinks that a prostitutes job depends on how good they are at sex. This is odd because he just listed homeless statistics in part 2. 7. My opponent then confirms that the system being non-mandatory would not prevent rape to it's utmost efficiency. (IF the belief that rape was due to lack of sex was true, it is not). [Proof requested] 1. My opponent is again, naive. He thinks the reporting system works, which is utterly shocking given that rape goes on because it does NOT work. This applies to both inside and out of prison. Note: Wow. 3 My opponent has ""no clue"" how much this would all cost nor any idea of implementation. Basically his idea is admittedly to be fantasy in a fantasy world. In conclusion:*(Mirror) My opponent did not show that rape would be reduced because of this or the cause of rape to be ""lack of sex"". My opponent did not show that this would make prostitutes lives better.*(and I'd argue there would be more risk in working at a prison as a prostitute than on the streets). My opponent again makes assumptions that because A works then B C and D would, without proving A. I do not need sources. It is simply not required in this debate for the Con side with the arguments provided. I probably have been arrogant and maybe condescending, I'll admit that, however I don't think that really changes the counter's brought up in the least. ------------------------------- My conclusion: Pro did not provide proof or logic that rape in prisons was from a lack of sex. Pro did not support his claim that the prostitutes would be fine under a report system. NOTE: One that does not work for rape already, hence prison rape existing in the first place. Pro provided no realistic outlook for the system as far as economic impact was concerned. Pro did not provide a reason for the American public to accept this system of any other or to support it over another system. ---------------------- Thanks for reading, Vote who you want to vote for."

S38f1c3c6-Acc1f2f21	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"I. Defining Resource Extraction It's very important that me and my opponent get on the same page here, because it's not happening. Resource extraction can include the harvesting, mining, or obtaining of any resource. My opponent wants to restrict me solely to mining, and things like fracking, which I refuse to do. I did not accept the debate under that context, and her own resolution suggests the extraction of any resource. Whether that be water, corn, or salt. I hope my opponent understands that you cant make a resolution saying ""resource extraction"" and restrict me to one archetype of the overlying category. That is foolish, and not acceptable in a debate of this time and magnitude. Thank you, and let's proceed. II. Surplus Money I want to address this point before I continue on to the others the opposition has made. This is due to her calling me out as dropping her arguments. This is not so. Her whole BOP resides on proving that you need to make money before you can be green. Otherwise, everyone would already be green. P1: Resource extraction is used to create surplus wealth (Net profit) P2: Resource extraction costs money P3: Green Technology can be and almost always is more expensive than base technology C1: Developing Nations should create surplus wealth before buying green technology The resolution has become more along the lines of becoming green before making money. This is great, but you need money to be green. It does not work vice versa, and this is where my opponent completely drops the ball. She refuses to tell me or the audience how she plans on making a nation green, without being wealthy. Unless my opponent can provide definite reasoning that people can make a nation green without making money, then her BOP is very much negated. This is not a net-good/net-harm debate. This is a one sided burden placed on my opponent, and it should be considered to the fullest extent. She can not simply shift saying ""we don't know all forms of being green"", or ""The scenarios are to broad to answer"". This is premise dropping, anyway you cut it. P1: If nations had the money to be green, they would P2: Nations who don't have the money to be green, need to make money C1: Developing countries should prioritize making money before trying to be green If the resolution was, ""Developing nations should put more emphasis on being green"", then I would agree with her. What the opposition and audience needs to understand though, is that money fixes most problems, and few things can be accomplished without $cash$. III. Environmentalist Rhetoric I want to emphasize this point again, and take note, this is not a shot at my opponent. Rhetoric was a classical school of debate, and is still taught in some colleges. Today though, it does not hold when it has been called out. My opponent and me agree. Resource extraction can hurt a nation, and being green helps it. This is not the crux of any of my arguments though. It's about what should be the priority, and you can't sauce a pizza without rolling the dough (Sorry, bad analogy). The point is that becoming green is step 2. Making money is step 1. You can't spend money you don't have, and for developing nations, resource extraction is the number one source of wealth. Trading commodities is really the only available market for developing countries. Let's take a look at this google search. https://www.google.com... Can my opponent name one developing nation that makes wealth on trades not based in commodities? The US doesn't produce as much resources anymore, because we created so much surplus wealth, we can focus on trading other peoples commodities. This is not true for the third world. They are stuck with one way to alleviate poverty, and that is resource extraction. This should be their first priority. IV. Being green doesn't make you the ""greens"" (money) My opponent has dropped this point as well. She must concede that resource extraction is the #1 way developing nations make money, but how can she attempt to prove being green is even a close #2? She can't. Her one contention was that being green ""helps"" resource extraction go smoother. It ""helps"" make more money. She has indirectly stated this. Even if this were true, she is conceding that being green is supportive in making money, which is not prioritizing. Opponent Siphoned Contention (Not True per say) P1: Being green supports the endeavor of making money P2: Being green does not actually make money by itself C1: Being green is not a priority in stimulating wealth. This contention does not negate her whole resolution, but it sure take a hell of a chunk out of it. Rebuttals V. China did not alleviate its poverty through resource extraction Two things to restate here. Harvesting food is indeed extracting a resource. China did in fact alleviate poverty through extraction of resources. Let's look at a treemap, to see if China makes its money through commodity exporting or importing. http://www.tradingeconomics.com... Now lets take a quick look at the commodities that are being exported. Over half of their economic exports are based in resources natural to China. It's official, China is making 50% of its economic complexity on inner resource extraction, which in the 80;s (when the boom started), it was entirely based in extracting resources. They can afford to spend 100% of their money on raw materials needed to ship out of the country as a result of resource extraction. In conclusion, China's success, is very much accredited to its vast extraction of resources. VI. Environmental protection preserves resources, IE, making more money This argument (the content within it) was a sight for sore eyes. The opposition contended that preserving resources to last longer makes that resource more profitable. At least I assume, because this reasoning makes no sense. Selling resources now produces the same amount of money as if we exported them later (Commodity prices exempted). The definition of economics, as learned in any Macro 1 course, is how the world decides to use its scare resources. My opponent has attempted to make an argument that breaks this fundamental rule. All resources are scare, and if the demand for a product exceeds its supply, it is a luxury. If the supply of a product exceeds its demand, it becomes free. All resources eventually disappear. This is a fundamental truth. No resource can reproduce forever, which is why this contention really comes down to one thing. Will making money now, help make more money later? Or will being green now, make more money later? Which brings me back to my earlier point. Being green costs money, which is why resource extraction (making money) will always be of first priority. VII. Conclusion Thanks for the debate, but my opponent BOP completely bombs in several areas, and due to the nature of this site, this should be taken very seriously. Until my opponent can resolve every issue brought forward, her BOP is negated."	CON	94
S38f1c3c6-A171a596e	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"Definitions My opponent went ahead and clarified the definition of resources. Note that I clarified what resources were in my definition of resource extraction. Since my opponent and I have very similar definitions, I am okay with my opponent's definition. My opponent then explains that one example will result in my not fulfilling my BoP. This is highly abusive because the resolution is talking about developing countries in general, not developing countries in every single circumstance. Thus, my opponent should at least try to talk about more than a few developing countries. Observations My opponent misunderstood the goal of my observations. I am simply clarifying what exactly we will be arguing about. I stated the full resolution in R1 and these two observations are simply for the purpose of making sure this debate is over the resolution. ""Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction when the two are in conflict."" The first observation explains that all my arguments are where environmental conflicts with resource extraction. This is because the resolution states this debate is over instances when the two are in conflict. Logically, if the debate is over when the two are in conflict. Neither I, nor my opponent can argue for the two to be held equally. My opponent seemed to misinterpret this; this observation does not only apply to him, but to me as well. Unless my opponent can explain how these observations contradict the resolution at hand, they must be followed throughout the debate. My Arguments 1. Developing countries have unstable environments due to resource extraction. Water- Firstly, my opponent never addresses my claim over water diseases resulting from excessive resource extraction. Instead, he brings up how forced irrigation benefited the people of Ethiopia. It is important to observe that irrigation is not a form of resource extraction. It does not fit my opponent's definition because irrigation itself is not a ""source of supply, support or aid that can be drawn upon when needed"" as my opponent's definition says. Therefore, this argument is out of the scope of the resolution and cannot be taken into account. Air- My opponent completely dropped this point. 800,000 people currently die each year from air pollution which can be caused by resource extraction. Forest Based Assets- My opponent also drops this point. Excessive deforestation in developing countries is exactly why 15 out of the essential services are currently being eroded. This is negatively impacting one seventh of the population which is currently counting on forest based assets to live. 2. Ensuring environmental stability through the prioritization of environmental protection over resource extraction will benefit developing countries. My opponent also drops this argument. I showed in these examples that the prioritization of environmental protection benefits developing countries in many ways. In Albania, it enabled citizens to farm. In Nepal, ""The remarkable turnaround in forest management in Nepal is directly attributable to the benefits generated for community groups, in the form of environmental goods, services, and welfare enhancements."" I would suggest that my opponent skim through source #6. This source contains many examples where environmental protection has benefited developing countries. 3. Millennium Development Goals (Social Development) and 4. Economic Development So, these points were about development. My opponent counters this by using China as an example. He explains that China used resource extraction to decrease poverty in their country in 1981-2008. I would like to note that absolutely no evidence is provided as to HOW China decreased poverty. Take a look at this list of things China did to decrease poverty (1). The collective agricultural service, set up by the People's Commune System (chief source or rural poverty) was gradually eliminated. Due to land reform, it was possible for citizens to purchase individually owned plots. This increased farmer's productivity, therefore boosting the economy. The government increased agricultural investments. One of the things they did was begin to use chemical fertilizers. Note that this is not an example of environmental protection/resource extraction conflict as long as the plants are not over fertilized. The government boosted the price of produce from farmers. Developmental assistance was given to various parts of the country that needed a large amount of help. Laborers from the poorer regions were encouraged to migrate. Notice that none of these points have anything to do with resource extraction. The truth is, China was able to successfully decrease poverty in by focusing on something that will actually benefit the citizens: agriculture. The things on the list are all either benefit the environment of simply don't affect it. Look to my fifth point in the R2. I explained that due to the corruption in developing countries, the money from resource extraction doesn't go to the impoverished individuals in society. Rather, it goes to the government. Environmental protection is an action that benefits the citizens of the developing country. Thus, in situations where countries have to choose between environmental protection and resource extraction, environmental protection is the ultimate choice. Also, look to the fact that when affirming the resolution, resource extraction is not abolished. Countries can still extract resources unless the extraction process seriously harms the environment. I explained in R2 that 25% of developing country's wealth comes from the environment. This 25% of the GDP is the part that is being given back to the citizens. In the case of Guatemala, the GDP went down 25% due to environmental problems. Not surprisingly, 75% of all citizens are living below the poverty line (2) and there is a large amount of corruption. This is a prime example of the resource curse. IN this case, and in the case of many other developing countries, the protection of the environment is the way to go. Environmental protection allows for more farming, and as we saw in the example of China, this can seriously benefit the economy. 5. Economic development is hindered by the prioritization of resource extraction. This is probably my most important point, yet my opponent did little to attack it. Here I proved that due to the high corruption levels, resource extraction often does little for the citizens (yet, as I have shown above), environmental protection can do a lot. Resources benefit the elite; the environment benefits the impoverished. Some environmental issues hurt everyone. Furthermore, many of the resources being extracted rapidly to make money are nonrenewable. If a country continues to extract the resources at such a rate, they will inevitably become harder to find. The country (developed or not) will certainly suffer if they run out of the resource that they rely on of income. Opponent's Arguments Surplus of Money My opponent basically explains (using no sources) that resource extraction does not account for any extra money and that it is very expensive. I'll go ahead and address a couple statements. ""Green technology isn't used much because it is expensive."" Let's look at the definition of green technology... ""Technology whose use is intended to mitigate or reverse the effects of human activity on the environment (Oxford)."" Green technology is a part of environmental protection, but it is not environmental protection itself. Environmental protection can come in ways that do not involve expensive technology. I would agree that environmental protection does cost money, but its benefits are undeniable. ""...when you start weighing the cost on a macro scale, you're presented with millions of problems."" Look to the fact that my opponent has not cited one example where resource extraction has hindered a developing country from social/economic development. Also, my opponent has provided no number for this ""large cost"" of environmental protection. I have shown through my evidence that the right way to develop is environmental protection because resource extraction simply does nothing for the impoverished. As I said above, look at source #6 that I cited in R2 for a multitude of success stories. ""If nations become profitable, then we can consider fancy new solar panels, or draining wharves."" These things are not exactly the type of environmental protection that we would most likely see being prioritized in developing countries. Conclusion Here, my opponent simply asks how developing countries are supposed to obtain money for environmental protection. I cannot give one generic answer because developing countries have different environmental issues, different resources, and different incomes. It is important to remember that developing countries have an environmental protection/resource extraction conflict, they must be getting some money from resource extraction. The idea is that this money, rather than going to the elite of society should be used for protecting the environment. As I showed throughout my case, this gives the country both economic and social development in the right way. As I said earlier, my opponent give no example of a developing country that has been negatively impacted through environmental protection. This is because environmental protection has numerous benefits that far outweigh its cost. (1) http://borgenproject.org... (2) http://web.worldbank.org..."	PRO	95
S22d02825-A3cdb482	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"FINAL REBUTTAL a. Necessity of Sourcing Pro claims that not all assertions need be sourced in a debate. For this he uses the example ""a Health Care Reform Bill was passed in 2010"". I argue that this is distracting because such a claim is not equivalent to those Pro was making. The only assertions not worth sourcing are: 1. Those which depend solely on logic rather than facts. 2. Those which are an assumption in the debate to begin with. 3. Those with do not effect the debate. An example of number 2 would be Pro's example. Another example would be that we are using English to do this debate. All other assertions which are dependent on facts, non-assumed, and are relevant to the resolution, must be sourced to substantiate their legitimacy. Otherwise, the quality of the debates would simply lack. b. Increases Taxes on the Rich and Decreased Revenue. Pro claims that: 1. Increasing taxes on the rich will decrease the revenue collected from them. 2. This is nearly unanimous among economists. Pro does provide a source. This source shows that there is an economist who agrees with this position. I can do that too[1]. Except that my economist also demonstrates facts rather than just theories. They explains that the historical record does not concur with Dr. Reynolds. The highest average annual growth in gross domestic product correlates with the time period when tax rates on the rich were highest. Then I have another economist who asserts that there is a consensus among economists opposite to what Pro proposed [2]. c. Medicare Savings Pro claims the board established by the health care reform legislation to limit the spending on medicare has no actual power to change it's spending and must consult congress. This is in-fact false. The IPAB replaces MedPAC, a board which used to be limited as Pro describes. IPAB has no such limitation, it is free to cut spending as it sees fit [3]. d. New Regulations and Forms Make it Hard to Start a Business Pro made several claims of which type of regulations the bill creates that he argues will make it harder to start a business. He says that he has a source, as he ought to. Unfortunately, I'm not able to locate it. None of the three sources that appear in his post seem to have anything to do with this point. It's possible that he had text cut off when he posted, this has happened to me. Looking over the review can prevent a mistake like this. Also, numbering your sources can prevent some confusion. Also, I'd like to point out that if this were true it does not refute the benefits to small businesses that I pointed out earlier, which are quite substantial. e. Surcharges Again, Pro says he has a source and I don't see it. Something must have gone wrong. Even if these surcharges exist it is not necessarily true that the cost will be passed down to those buying insurance, indeed, it certainly will not be passed down to those who have free of cheaper insurance due to the legislation. f. Taxes on Small Business Owners Pro's attitude towards sourcing is a bit discouraging. It is not the obligation of someone viewing the debate to find out everything we're referring to. The vast majority of people are completely uninformed about politics aside from the repeated headlines. It's simply professional to be well-sourced in a debate. Not to mention that it's one of the voting factors. Now, I didn't at first realize what Pro meant. Until he clarified I thought he was referring to a tax directed at small business owners, not the tax on those with $250,000 yearly incomes, of which some may happen to be small business owners. In-fact, this is highly over stated. 98.1% percent of small-business filers have income too low to be subject to the tax [4]. g. Necessity of Medicaid Here it seems like Pro ignored my comment. I argue that even if Medicaid isn't giving as good of care as private insurers, which Pro admitted is an unclear issue, it is getting care to people who otherwise would not have it. That is something you just can't put a price tag on. h. Morality of the Bill Pro asserts that through rationing care the bill will not save lives. I have already demonstrated that the bill does not ration care and that, in-fact, it does the opposite by preventing private insurers from ever doing so. i. Ad Hominem The statement: ""It seems that my opponent believes that Health Decisions are too important for individuals to make in a private market, and should therefore be made by the government."" Firstly, it's a personal attack. Secondly, it's an irrelevant personal attack. Thirdly, it's a false, irrelevant personal attack. Obviously, my intentions are not sinister, wanting to take away people's choices and give them to the government. The bill gives people power over their own lives by being able to afford health care and increases personal choice by regulating the abusing power that insurance companies have exercised over patients, particularly through the Patient's Bill of Rights. j. Rationing Care Here Pro simply makes several completely unsubstantiated claims. k. Forcing Young Adults to Buy Insurance Pro by some stretch of the imagination finds it justified to simply reassert what I clearly just negated. Reread my explanation if you want to see me say it again. l. Insuring Those With Pre-Existing Conditions. Pro finds it hard to figure this out. Read slowly. Insurance companies would not insure those with pre-existing conditions. Pro wants to insure those with pre-existing conditions. He also doesn't want to force insurance companies to insure them. He can't have it both ways. He said give the states grants and let them decide. Just what other solution does he think they would have? These are sick people who would not have care that now have it thanks to the bill. It's black and white here, c'mon. The only other policy that would get care to all these people without forcing insurance companies to do it would be with a national health care service. Also, we're not debating what the best health care system would be. We're debating whether the health care system is better now that this legislation has been implemented. CONCLUSION I have negated all of the attacks Pro made against the bill with substantial evidence. Pro frequently made claims without proper substantiation and at times resorted to logical fallacies. Vote Con for best argument and sources. Vote Pro on conduct for me forfieting a round.

S554eb968-Ad3c50134	Taxes should be raised on the rich	"I thank my opponent for creating a great debate. Let's do this! I will make my own case first and then do refutations. My Case C1: Laffer Curve One of the most important factors in an economy is the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve, which Dr. Arthur Laffer leant his name to the curve after discussing it with some aides from the Ford administration, shows the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues. I will link a picture to show what it looks like. The important thing to understand is two scenarios in which the tax rate is either at 0% or 100%. In both cases the government is getting no money by either no taxes or a rate so high no one would possibly work because of how much money they would not be making. As the rate rises from 0% the government gets money and as it lowers from 100% more people come back to work. The important thing to understand is that at some point the government would lose revenue rather than make it with higher rates and that is why lower rates should be implented. When tax rates are high, rich people stop investing their money and find tax shelters for it, but when its lower they continue to invest and expand their businesses. [1,2] C2: History I. Harding-Coolidge Tax Cuts Under Woodrow Wilson, the top tax rate rose to a high of 77% and the country went into recession in 1921. Warren G. Harding became the next president of the United States and lowered the rate to 50% followed by Calvin Coolidge after his death, who lowered the top rate to 25%. This was followed by huge economic growth and a massive budget surplus. During this same period, Real GDP growth expanded from 2.0% before the cut to 3.4% after. The unemployment rate fell from 6.5% to 3.1%. In 1920, the share of revenue for those with over an income of $100,000 was 29.9%, but it was 62.2% by 1929. This actually got the rich to pay more in taxes than they did with a higher rate. Production increased dramatically. [1] Even more specifically with the Coolidge cuts: ""Nor is it surprising that, with increased economic activity following the shift of vast sums of unemployment rate from 1925 through 1928 ranged from a high of 4.2 percent to a low of 1.8 percent."" [4] II. Kennedy Tax Cut The tax rates did rise to a high of 90%, but more to that in my refutations later. JFK wanted to pass his own tax cut and bring the top rate down from 90% to 70%. He was killed (interesting notice: both Harding and JFK were supply-side guys and died), but LBJ passed the tax cuts anyway. The results showed modest improvements. Real GDP grew from 4.6% to 5.1% and unemployment went from 5.6% to 3.9%. The Congressional Budget Office looked into federal budget receipts and found huge increases in billions of dollars that exceeded expectations. [1,3] III. Reagan Tax Cuts We all know that Reagan passed major tax cuts during his presidency that expanded the economy dramatically. The top tax rate went from JFK's 70% in 1981 to several lower rates before finally finishing at 28% in 1988. Once again, looking at the some economic figures. Real GDP growth was at 0.9% before the tax cuts to 4.8% after and unemployment decline from 10.8% at its height down to 5.4%. As with the two previous examples, the economy grew rapidly. C3: Income Mobility When the tax rates have been lowered we have seen huge income mobility among people. In a sense, it spreads wealth around and increase income mobility better than any social program could. This means that lower taxes is better in helping the poor because businesses are able to provide more jobs and increase wages. Income mobility is in the best interest of the people. During the Harding-Coolidge years: ""The facts are plain: There were 206 people who reported annual taxable that number fell drastically, to just 21 people by 1921. Then, after a series of tax rate cuts during the 1920s, the number of individuals reporting taxable incomes of a million dollars or more rose again to 207 by 1925. Under these conditions, it should not be surprising that the government collected more tax revenue after tax rates were cut."" [4] During the Reagan years: ""The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose by 5 points from 30.9 percent to nearly 35.9 percent. During the 1980s, millions of middle-class Americans disappeared into the ranks of the affluent."" [5] During the Reagan years, there were fewer than 5,000 people who had an income of $1 million or above. When he left 35,000 people did. This shows that there was huge income mobility at the time. [5] My Case R1: Higher Taxes do not Benefit My opponent and his report claim that when taxes were higher, economic growth was greated. This is simply not true. The rate was 90% under Eisenhower and the economy grew at 2.3%. During the Kennedy/Johnson presidencies when the tax rate was 70% the economy grew at 4.9%. This is far greater than under Eisenhower. Under Reagan, the economy grew at 3.2% with his low tax rates. In fact, every president beat Eisenhower with his 90% rate in economic growth except George H.W. Bush. [6] It is clear that the economy grew strongly when the top tax rate was cut. R2: Capital Gains According to Shlaes: ""The study was published in 2010, and Sinai says he still stands by it. The results are dramatic. Right now, economists say the economy needs to create about 2.4 million jobs a year. Sinai found that eliminating the capital-gains tax alone, with no other policy change, would create 1.3 million per annum, or more than half the total sought. Real gross domestic product would increase by 0.23 percentage point a year. The jobless rate would drop by as much as 0.7 percentage point in a year. And productivity gains would increase by 0.5 percentage point a year."" [7] The capital gains tax hinders the expansion of business and entrepreneurship which is necessary for every free market capitalist economy to expand, but taxes has hindered them. George Gilder writes about the history of the tax that: ""Government tax policies have done their best to deter innovation and promote mergers, creating a capital blight in which smaller companies that were attempting to expand suffered most throughout the 1970s."" [8] R3: History I have proven through the Laffer curve that tax revenue increased dramatically from when it was under higher rates and the economy expanded much faster. Why? Because people took their money out of tax shelters and invested or saved it allowing for economic growth and more revenue. The stock market grew stronger under Coolidge and Reagan than it did under Ike. Coolidge saw over 260% of Dow Jones growth and Reagan saw over 130%. Ike saw 120% growth, but remember that no one was paying their true income in the 1950s as they tried to hide their money. [9] FDR saw larger growth than Reagan's, but this was mostly because of World War 2 growth. Unemployment fell and real GDP increased, but only because of the war. Sources 1. Laffer, Arthur.

S14e017ba-Aad23883d	The USA should establish a Single-Payer Health Care System	"Thanks Contra. == My case == Lucky for us, single-payer health insurance has been tried in a number of other countries. Let's see if it has made these countries better off. C1) Rationing of care When you make health insurance free for everyone, people feel like they no longer have to pay for medical services. When *any* service is free, people overuse it. A well-known study by the RAND Corporation found that free health insurance increased the amount of health services used by the participants, particularly in the category of ""inappropriate or unnecessary medical care""; obviously, this increased treatment did not improve health outcomes. [1] In addition, a study at Dartmouth Medical School and a study of Medicare found that ""when health care is free . . . people will exhaust [all] available resources despite whether or not it has any benefit on their health."" [2] What this means is that under single-payer health insurance, people *do* exhaust all available medical resources, creating long wait times for people who actually *need* medical treatment. For example, in England, citizens take an average of one ambulance trip per citizen per year, 91% of which are for non-emergency purposes. [9] Because they are free, the British are treating ambulances as taxis. As a result, wait times in single-payer systems are well documented. A study in Sweden concluded: ""Long waiting lists for coronary artery bypass grafting are associated with considerable mortality."" [3] More than 50% of people in Sweden have to wait longer than 3 months for surgery. [5] In England, 21% of lung cancer patients become incurable while on the wait list. [4] ""The World Health Organization has recently called [England's National Health Service] a deliverer of ‘third world cancer care.'"" [2] In Canada, ""Only half of ER patients are treated in a timely manner by national and international standards, according to a government study."" [6] That's scary given that most Emergency Room patients are in dire need of treatment. Supposedly the greatest feature of single-payer insurance is increased access for the poor and ""fairness,"" i.e. equal access for all. However, in Japan, the rich routinely bribe their way to the top of the wait list. [9] Canada's Fraser Institute finds that wait lists in Canada are ""routinely jumped by the famous and politically-connected."" [7] The rich still get better access to treatment in Canada, which is why a study published in the Forum for Health Economics & Policy concluded ""that the poor [in Canada] under socialized medicine seem to be less healthy . . . than their American counterparts."" [6] That's pretty bad considering the number of uninsured in the United States. Apparently it's better to be uninsured in the U.S. than insured by the government in Canada. A similar study in England concluded that health outcomes for the poor had not improved since implementing a single-payer system in 1948. [9] C2) Quality of American government health care To see if single-payer would be better in the US, we can look to whether our government is good at providing medical insurance by examining Medicare and Medicaid. According to the New York Times, more and more doctors are opting out of Medicare, ""The doctors' reasons: reimbursement rates are too low and paperwork too much of a hassle."" [10] USA Today reports that Congress is cutting reimbursement rates for Medicare by a further 21%; currently, the AMA reports that 17% of all doctors and 31% of primary care physicians are not accepting Medicare patients, but the number will double after the 21% reimbursement cut. [11] The numbers for Medicaid are even worse. In addition, the price controls for medicine that the government has implemented in Medicare is contributing to massive drug shortages. The Heritage Foundation reports that price controls under Medicare Part B are the #1 contributor to the shortage of 178 different generic drugs. [12] If our government ran all insurance, these shortages would become more severe. C3) Cost In France, the system costs 40% of government revenue and implements a payroll tax of 20% on citizens. [13] This amounts to a cost of $1 trillion a year in the US to the government alone. In addition, France is running a $13.5 billion shortfall per year and its health care system is on the verge of bankruptcy. [14] The US cannot afford such an expensive system when we're already struggling with our budget deficit. In addition, Americans cannot afford such an expensive system during a recession. ""It has been estimated that a Swedish-style single-payer health insurance system in America would cost the median-income household some $17,200 per year in health care taxes."" [15] C4) Physician shortages The US is already projecting shortages in the number of nurses and other health care professionals. Single-payer reimbursement rates are low, as we saw with Medicare. In France, doctors earn a third of what they do in the US. [16] In Japan, doctors must see 40 patients per day to make a decent living. [9] For this reason, in a survey, one in five US doctors said they would quit if the US implemented single-payer insurance. [17] France has a huge problem with doctor shortages. [20] C5) Drug innovation A study by the Boston Consulting Group found that price controls under single-payer systems resulted in an average ""loss of $17-22 billion annually in pharmaceutical research, resulting in the loss of 10 to 13 new drug launches"" per year per country. [18] For this reason, most countries rely on the US for drug innovations. C6) Death Panels My opponent says in his conclusion that he sets up a Health Planning board to decide which treatments to cover and which life saving treatments to NOT cover. In England, a similar death panel decided to deny a life extending drug to MS patients. [19] == Rebuttal == R1) Patient choice What my opponent has described – being able to see any doctor or specialist – exists in the private insurance market now – it's called a PPO. HMO's, which are cheaper forms of health insurance, allow you to see any specialist but your primary care physician must issue you a ""referral,"" deeming the visit medically relevant. HMO's have lower premiums precisely because they prevent patients from taking unnecessary trips to see expensive specialists. In contrast, free choice means overuse of resources, resulting in long waiting lists under single-payer systems. R2) Increased innovation My opponent provides no actual evidence that single-payer systems are more innovative, while I have a study proving that their price controls ensure they are much less innovative. In fact, due to the high medical costs of single-payer insurance, Canada spends almost NOTHING on Research & Development. [9] R3) More efficient? A study by the Heritage Foundation found that Medicare administrative costs are only lower as a percentage of total costs because Medicare spending outlays on medicine are ENORMOUS, so administrative costs look small in comparison. [21] Heritage concludes that on a *per patient* basis, Medicare administrative costs were 48.4% higher than for private insurance in 2000. [21] The NYT evidence made clear: all doctors agree that Medicare has more annoying bureaucracy and paperwork than private insurance. R4) Decrease cost? Obama's 2009 health care reform already implements many of these cost saving measures. For example, the reform requires that 80% of private insurance premiums go to medical treatment, which will make private insurers even more efficient. In addition, France's deficit proves that single-payer is not cheaper due to the overuse of free treatment. R5) Coverage of all? ""As the Canadian Supreme Court said upon ruling unconstitutional a Quebec law that banned private health care, ‘access to a waiting list is not access to health care.'"" [18] R6) Quality of care? See rationing. My opponent cites rankings based on life expectancy figures. A great article in Forbes questions how the number of car accidents in a country (which affects life expectancy) is relevant in measuring health care outcomes [22]. Forbes says we should measure how well the system performs at *the point of intervention,* meaning once you get sick. The US ranks #1 on ""5-year survival rates for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, and prostate cancer."" [22] R7) Bankruptcies Most medical bankruptcies are incurred after an insurance company denies coverage for expensive experimental or uncovered treatments. Rationing and death panels would lead to the same or worse outcomes. In Canada, people desperate for care come to the US for treatment and pay cash. [9] [1] http://tinyurl.com...

S9d5a13c2-Af88d1cea	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	"MY TURN! C1: The Resolution is a Minor Concession by my Opponent Roy is advocating to that it ought to not increase. This must mean that my opponent concedes that there are benefits of the MW in the first place. If my opponent thought that the MW was more harmful than beneficial, he would have advocated for it's complete abolishment. Otherwise, there is at least some reason to keep minimum wage (MW). C2: The Role of the Government is Not a Factor Here I would like to point out that this debate revolves around the evaluation of a policy. The question is not what the government's role ought to be. The topic of this debate must assume that the government is already involved, and the question of this debate is whether it has been economically beneficial or not. Therefore, my opponents entire 4th point concerning welfare is completely irrelevant. Besides, MW and welfare are different. To justify keeping MW the same, he must in fact show the effects of this on the whole economy. When my opponent reverts to microeconomics to try and justify his position, this is null-and-void. Turn: Without raising MW, the costs to the state is substantial: we lose tax revenue, more people go on welfare programs, some look to the “shadow economy” and begin to commit crimes, etc... So by taking the position my opponent has maintained, he is actually making those dependant on the state worse off by opposing MW, instead of saving money by increasing wages. Besides, my opponent completely forgets that if MW increases, people will be encouraged to find a job through legal means. [http://tinyurl.com..., http://tinyurl.com...] C3: MW Hasn't Been Abolished Due to it's Effectiveness Thought experiment: MW enters the US in about the 1930's under FDR's New Deal. Since then, the MW legislation has been increased in the US alone 22 times. Unless it was beneficial to the people, politicians, and businesses, then why has it not been abolished? In fact, why has it been furthered even surpassing federal levels in some states? Heck, why is it that in some parts of South Asia, Latin America, and Africa, a MW is simply customary? The answer is simple: MW legislation simply works. Well over 90% of the world has some form of a MW legislation, so there’s lots of data for us to analyze. [http://tinyurl.com...] C4: MW Improves the Gini Coefficient Pretty self-explanatory: when MW hikes happen, every single index from the Gini Coefficient to Atkinson indexes, or even standard deviation of logarithms, show great improvement for the US. Meaning when MW hikes happen, income mobility is dramatically improved, and ones ability to improve their financial situation from their parents is increased. (“the American Dream” folks?!)[http://tinyurl.com...] C5: Monopsonistic Competition Unfairly Favour Businesses Imperfect competition has resulted in a buyer being able to unfairly dictate it's terms to the seller (worker) because of the volume of sellers. When competition between sellers ensues, the marginal product of labour (MLP) drops. The seller is producing the same amount of goods, but at a reduced price. As a result when MW increases, employment and wages go up as well. When we ask how much MW should increase, we look to MLP for equilibrium. MW is a legislation that regulates a market failure, not some silly “free-lunch” handout my opponent dresses it up as. [http://tinyurl.com...] Re1: Labour Costs Are About 25-35% of Fast Food Costs If we were to have a controlled experiment between someone who does pay MW (Walmart) vs paying more (Costco) we find that Costco actually saves money due to less turnover rates in the long run. [http://tinyurl.com...] Re2: Increase Costs Actually Can Come From Revenue, in Fact My Opponent Himself Stated This in His First Paragraph (Price Increases) Senator Elizabeth Warren notes on raising MW, McDonalds would be able to raise their prices about 8 more cents per burger to off-set the increase in labour costs (assuming MW is up to $14.75/hour). Meaning that increase costs can be compensated with additional revenue, my opponent noted this himself. It doesn't make sense to claim that prices will increase, but somehow revenue is lost when prices compensate for those factors. Furthermore, this is NOT counting the fact that most people who make a yearly income of $5,000 or less (students) spend about 6.2% of their income at fast-food chains. This is also not including the fact that increasing MW, as economist Robert Reich notes, only effects industries such as fast food, hospitality chains, and retail. Far more people will actually have more money to spend, furthering productivity, and the amount of money McDonalds gets in return as a result is higher than what my opponent claims. [http://tinyurl.com..., http://tinyurl.com..., http://tinyurl.com...] Re3: My Opponent Assumes the Neoclassical Model of Supply and Demand When Claiming Half The Jobs Would Be Lost My opponent is assuming a basic supply and demand model in microeconomics. As OMGJustinBeiber points out: “To get that degree of precision would presupposing a kind of uniform rationality in regard to the consumer and producer, which obviously doesn't exist in the real world. Unfortunately, my opponent demands this exact precision – [""Raising minimum wage would costs half the jobs, jobs will be lost to technology""] -- to make his case. Short of believing this standard we must vote con.” For instance, my opponent notes a completely automated McDonalds in Tokyo, but as much as it makes complete rational sense for every single McDonalds to go this way (saves on labour costs substantially to the investor) they simply have not done it yet even after a MW hike in 2007! Rationally, this is the most illogical thinking I have ever seen if my opponents claim is correct! Meaning that some things demanded, or even supplied have absolutely no rational basis for them, and this assumption of actors always working for their own rational self-interests is nonsense. In fact, in his claim that jobs would be lost, he cites he following study: .Burkhauser, Couch et Wittenburg, “Who Minimum Wage Increases Bite: An Analysis Using Monthly Data from the SIPP and CPS”, Southern Economic Journal, 2000. Upon examining the study, it only used 3 points of data constituting a hasty conclusion. Turn: My opponent claims that if MW increases, McDonalds would have incentive to replace workers with technology, costing jobs. However, he actually made a de facto case for minimum wage, as technology is a benefit to the economy not a detriment! Furthermore, this article was made in 2003 as his citation notes. Lets not forget MW at the federal level was increased in 2007, yet this fear of a complete automated McDonalds has yet to appear in the US (to the best of my knowledge). This is an irrational position for my opponent to claim; if my opponent's claim was correct, McDonalds would have already automated everything in every store. [http://tinyurl.com...] studies show that jobs are increased or are unaffected when MW is increased. The studies done by Card and Kruger show this when comparing New Jersey to Pennsylvania. This was after New Jersey hiked their MW in 1992 by 18%. This was repeated using the data from a federal MW hike, and California hike and the findings stayed the same. When we drop the supply and demand model, and actually precisely look at the employment impacts of a MW hike, they either remain unchanging or increase. [http://tinyurl.com..., http://tinyurl.com..., http://tinyurl.com...] Re4: Role of the Government (See C2) Conclusion: My opponent displays kettle logic and agreed with me on some points: MW increases technological innovation, businesses would not lose money due to price increases. The monsopolistic society we live in would heavily benefit from a MW increase when we drop the “s/d” generalities, and observe precise impacts via Card and Kruger studies. I did not ask for special treatment! Thank You"	CON	101
S9d5a13c2-A66a69ad1	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	"Unions recently staged protests demanding that McDonald's in the U.S. should be required to pay workers a minimum of $15 per hour. An ABC News report provides some background on the issue [1. http://abcnews.go.com...]. While McDonald's was the focus of the demonstrations, a law cannot target just one fast food company. If that were legal, other chains might get most of the business, McDonald's would largely fail, and workers would be back at the current minimum wage of $7.25 working at competitors. Therefore, the resolution requires all fast food restaurants be required by law to pay $15 per hour. The Pro position is that the disadvantages of requiring $15 per hour are greater than the advantages, and Con will argue the opposite. The purpose of focusing on the fast food industry, and McDonald's in particular, is to provide an example with real numbers in the economics. The debate is about the situation in the US, as other countries are often not comparable. American ""fast food"" is considered upscale in some places.

S554eb968-A3b15acc8	Taxes should be raised on the rich	"""Those two videos were an attempt to add in more material while getting passed the character limit. They certainly do not fall under the character limit, I ask they be dismissed due to violation of the rules."" No they weren't. I added them for use of showing how President Coolidge vetoed most progressive legislation including those farm subsidy bills. I am going to assume that my opponent means I hacked debate.org by making the character limit longer in order to add videos, but I don't know how to hack anything so that was not my intention. The Great Depression video was there to explain how more economic intervention such as tax increases dramatically hurt an economy. Again it fell in 10,000 characters, so I do not understand what my opponent is citing. Perhaps he can cite the code of conduct for a better understanding in the comments or pm it to me. My Case C1: Laffer Curve Simply relying on charities and non-profit organizations in an economic recession, or in an economy in general, is a very bad idea. Businesses will always be there and they need profit. The more profit they have then the more they can expand their businesses. The same with capital gains taxes to expand ideas and entreprenuers. My opponent seems to be arguing to get rid of private businesses who seek maximum profit for charity. That does not work. My opponent did note what Arthur Laffer has said, but my opponent has not give an alternative form besides the Laffer curve to look at when discussing tax revenue and economics growth. Had he mentioned another kind of curve or idea then we might have something. Since he has not, we only have the Laffer curve to follow. I have won this argument. C2: History I. Harding-Coolidge Tax Cuts As I stated before from Shales' book and that video, most farm subisides were cancelled and did not have a huge effect in the 1920s because they did not exist for most of the era we are discussing. They only existed in the early part of the 1920s and were stopped or vetoed when Coolidge entered office in 1923. Because of the fact that the subsidies were not responsbile for the economic boom that dominated most of the 1920s, they are not a benefit. The lower tax rate under Calvin Coolidge actually got the rich to pay more in taxes. Those making over $100,000 shared 29.9% of the total payed income taxes. In 1929 when Coolidge left office they payed 62.2%. This is before Hoover's tax increases. What we can see here is that there is a huge correlation between lower tax rates making the rich pay more. Higher tax rates make the rich pay less of the percentage. [1] I showed economic variables before and after the tax cuts. What we saw was that there was more growth after the tax cuts because businesses could expand more. I will briefly refute Clinton with the 1994 midterms: “We took a special interest in 1946 and 1994 when a first- term Democratic president lost both houses of Congress to the opposing party,” Birinyi analysts Cleve Rueckert and Daniel Erdelyi wrote in the report. “In both cases the market was down in the two months prior to the election, and was up over the ensuing three months.” [2] When the Democrats lost Congress in 1994, the stock market grew at a rapid pace. In late 1993 the GDP growth rate was 2.1%. After the midterms it was 5.4%. We can clearly see that the supply-side Republicans saved the economy by simply winning Congress in 1994. [3] II. Kennedy Tax Cut My opponent looks at only some cases of abolishing the death penalty. Let's look at the specific my time my opponent was talking about instead of simply a few states at later times. According to Johansen: ""The number of executions plummeted from 47 in 1962 to 2 in 1967 to zero in 1968. The homicide rate, which had been holding steady around 50 throughout the 50's, started up in 1965, just two years after executions began their plummet. The biggest increase in one year came in 1967, the same year that the last person was executed."" [4] Here's a graph to back that up: http://www.debate.org... When the death penalty was put back in place crime fell by a wide margin. Now on the unions. Unions have been found to help their workers but hurt consumers and people searching for jobs. They block the market from hiring new people and effectively tax investors forcing businesses to pass the expenses of higher wages to consumer through higher prices. They completely cause a negative effect. [5] III. Reagan Tax Cuts My opponent looks into a depression occuring sometime around 1987 and 1988. Unemployment remained under 6% for the rest of Reagan's presidency after the recession (http://www.debate.org...). It was clear here that there was massive economic growth. Stocks boomed under Reagan as well (http://www.debate.org...). We can see here that there was clear economic growth from Reagan's tax cuts. Inflation dropped heavily under Reagan from 11.8% to 4.7% [7] I have already refuted Clinton's ""growth"" which was caused by capital gains tax cuts and the 1994 ""Republican Revolution"". C3: Income Mobility I have already refuted this point by proving that the poorest fifth of the American made more money $6,494 to $6,994 in a period from 1980 to 1989. The poor did make more money, the reason it is small is because most poor people don't work and live off government welfare systems, so obviously they would not be effected by any tax cut, but they still did better under Reagan than Carter did. [6] My Refutations R1: Taxes Benefit the Economy My opponent made this argument through the Eisenhower years, but he has not brought Ike back up so this must be dropped. He instead changed his own argument to a different period. This argument was dropped. R2: Capital Gains Taxes According to the article: ""Sinai says he favors raising taxes on one kind of capital gain, carried interest, to treat it as ordinary income. But the bigger picture is that lower taxes on capital are good for workers, a group that includes protesters and their siblings. They will have to decide whether they care more about punishing the rich or about increasing the number of jobs on offer to their friends. It’s a tough call. My guess is, as the temperature drops, the protesters will take jobs over rage."" [8] R3: New Deal Unemployment drops inevitably the recession. We want to know what makes it drop faster, higher tax rates or lower ones. In this case this case lower tax rates were needed because it was proven they could work. Instead, FDR had a huge tax hike which would lessen economic growth and weaken the recovery as proven the Ohanian study. R5: Gini Coefficent Look up because I refuted this point earlier with wages and inflation. My opponent talked about income inequality in his R7, but that is discussed higher too. Conclusion I have proven tax cuts on the rich help everyone by dramatically increasing economic growth and saving the economy. They create jobs and increase income mobility.

Sf08ced27-A5b1659f7	Smoking should be banned	"I accept this challenge. Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do choose to breathe in other people""s smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public. If enough people want to go to non-smoking bars, companies will set up non-smoking bars. If there are no non-smoking bars, this suggests that very few people want them. Some people are quite happy to work in smoky places. In any case, workers should be allowed to choose to work in dangerous conditions. This is accepted for jobs like mining, fishing and the armed forces. Individuals decide that they are better doing this work than not having a job at all. A complete ban is not necessary to protect workers anyway "" ventilation fans can remove most smoke. A ban on smoking in public places would drive many bars, pubs and clubs out of business. Smokers would not go to these places. These businesses would also earn less money from selling tobacco. In many places, pubs and Working Men""s Clubs are important social places for communities. They also provide jobs for people with few skills in places with little other work. It is therefore important that they survive. It would be impossible to police this ban in many public places. Small workplaces will often ignore the ban and are unlikely to be caught. Staff who do not smoke are unlikely to report smokers, in case their colleagues work out who told the authorities. THE FACTS : Economic Impact - It is the hospitality industry that the smoking ban seems to affect the most. People who smoke, are often major patrons of cafe, bars, and restaurants, and the number of these patrons tends to diminish when a smoking ban is imposed. - The reduction in the number of patrons would earn them lesser profits, thus leading to financial difficulties. Moreover, if these difficulties go on increasing by the day, some of the businesses might also consider permanent closure. - In such cases, the risk of more and more employees losing their jobs is elevated. Also, the job market would, in turn, generate much lesser jobs, leading to a rise in unemployment. - The government earns a lot of revenue through the sale of tobacco and cigarettes. The ban results in a major drop in this revenue. Personal Right : - It has been argued that imposing a smoking ban is against the 'freedom of choice'. Some people opine that it is okay to do anything one wants as long as he/she is not hurting the others in the process. - Some have proposed that nonsmokers, in order to avoid inhaling the smoke, may prevent themselves from going to places that allow smoking. However, this is not always possible. - Moreover, banning only smoking as a potential health hazard seems a little absurd as there are some other substances as well (drugs, alcohol, etc.), which pose similar, or rather much greater health hazards. Difficult to Implement - Though a smoking ban may seem like a brilliant idea to control the potential dangers, it is not always easy to implement at all places. - Many times, it is extremely difficult for businesses to disallow their patrons from smoking in their premises, especially if the patrons insist on the same. - Furthermore, isolated areas such as washrooms, where people might secretly smoke, cannot be monitored all the time. - Also, if it is a small or a new business, it may not afford to lose its clients because of the ban. After all, it all about survival. In such cases, the ban loses its purpose. So, pro can't only look in one side but must look in all side if government banned smoking. And pro only give us his argue without solution to solve other problem if government banned smoking. Pro must think about what will happen after that. And in the fact, if government banned smoking give more negative effects than positive effect."	CON	104
Scde43845-Aa01412a	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Trade can be restricted by several means. Tariffs can be put on imports and exports in a direct violation of free trade. However, indirect methods can be used to upset free markets. Governments can provide research or production subsidies, and the government can require purchase of local products for government use. For example, Friedman [1. http://www.thomaslfriedman.com... ] documents the bad effect of agricultural subsidies in Europe and the United States have had on Third World economies by obviating the advantage that producers would otherwise have in certain crops. 1. Free Trade Benefits Both Trading Partners A producer of certain goods has an absolute advantage if he can produce those goods more cheaply than anyone else. almost always, a country has an absolute advantage in producing some goods. Free trade maximizes efficiency, and hence prosperity, by allowing countries to produce more of the goods they are best at, and less of the goods at which they are less efficient. An economy that has no absolute advantage will nonetheless have a comparative advantage [2. http://en.wikipedia.org...] in producing some goods over others. The theory of comparative advantage then shows that the country is better off producing more of what it is better at producing, and less of other things. The theory f comparative advantage says that both trading partners will still benefit from free trade, even one has no absolute advantage in anything. We might wonder how poor countries have an advantage in anything. Agricultural products depend upon growing conditions and labor costs. No matter how well capitalized, the US does not have an advantage in growing bananas or coffee. Poor countries have cheap labor and are likely to have an advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing. Poor countries often have unique attractions that make them competitive for tourism. In most economies the majority of goods and services are not subject to foreign competition. Restaurants and local shops, schools and government, roads and airports, houses and commercial buildings, as well as all the support services that go along with these things are not subject to foreign competition. Friedman [1] calculated that only 19% of the U.S, GDP is subject to potential foreign competition. ""For 2011, exports of $2,103.1 billion and imports of $2,661.1 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $558.0 billion ..."" [3. http://www.bea.gov... ] The Gross Domestic Product was $15,094.4 billion. [4. http://www.bea.gov... ] so 17.4% of GDP was spent on imports, but all but 3.6% of that was offset by exports. Does the theory of comparative advantage work in practice? ""Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among members of the economics profession in the U.S. is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society.[26] [27] In a 2006 survey of American economists (83 responders), ""87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade"" and ""90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries.""[28] [5. http://en.wikipedia.org... ] 2. Dislocations are acute, benefits are chronic If there is nearly universal agreement among economists that free trade is beneficial, then why is it so often opposed? The reason is that the job losses are easy to identify while the job gains are spread over society. for example, the U.S. allows inexpensive manufactured goods to be imported. Jobs sewing underwear were consequently lost in North Carolina, and it's easy to point to those lost jobs. The gain is in the lowered price of underwear, a gain that benefits buyers of underwear. Money not spent on underwear is then available for other purposes. The money saved is available to purchase competitive goods. Wal-Mart calculated that the total saved from Wal-Mart pricing amounted to $2500 per family in 2006. [6. http://www.aef.com...] Wal-mart got into trouble by implying that the saving came solely from Wal-Mart, when it actually came from the general lowering of prices by Wal-marts competitors as well. The lower prices do not derive entirely from imports. Some of the savings come from the efficiency of the distribution system. The point is that the economy benefits by spending fewer resources on things that America is not competitive in producing, and greater resources on things in which it is competitive. Friedman's book [1] catalogs examples of high tariffs damaging economies around the world. South America, notably Brazil, ""protected"" local markets with high tariffs for decades, with resulting poverty. Removing tariffs were key to economic revival. In the early 50s, Hindustani Motors in India and Toyota in Japan were about equal-sized car manufacturers. Hindustani Motors was protected by high tariffs, while Toyota was subject to international competition. Predictably, competition yielded efficiency and growth. It's reasonable for government to assist in retraining and relocating workers for jobs in growth industries. It is unreasonable to suppose the country's future lies in keeping workers sewing underwear forever at the expense of consumers. Customers have a right to buy inexpensive products Government does not have a right to force consumers to pay high prices to keep outdated industries alive. If consumers choose to buy more expensive products for whatever reasons, that the consumer's business. Government doesn't have the right to make the decision that a consumer will pay more for products A, B, and C because the government favors those industries. It is an unjustified intrusion upon the individual's right to make consumer choices. There is inherent corruption in government choosing which outdated industry is to receive the benefits of protection and by how much. Once a general promise of protection is made, then when an industry starts to fall behind foreign competition their remedy is seek protection from competition rather than reform and become more efficient. Government must decide how much above market price an inefficient producer will be paid. That determination is subject to political influence. Around 1990, the world price of sugar was four cents a pound. Price supports kept the domestic U.S. price at 22 cents. Now, price supports keep the domestic price at two or three times the world market price. Consumers end up paying the subsidy, but also production of candy is shifted out of the United States and the candy is imported instead of the sugar. [7. http://news.medill.northwestern.edu...] that costs manufacturing jobs. Trade promotes peace Free trade benefits both sides of the trading partnership. The theory agrees with a common sense understanding a deal depends upon both sides benefiting. Both the trade process and the results favor peace. ""Quantitative studies provide a great deal of evidence for a causal chain running from free trade via prosperity and democracy to the avoidance of military conflict, as well as for another causal relationship between trade or economic openness and conflict avoidance."" [8. http://www.independent.org...] Critics have argued that while conflict reduces trade, trade does not reduce conflict. A recent study [9. http://www.yale.edu...] refutes that analysis. ""Previous studies that address the endogeneity of trade ... have not overstated the benefit of interdependence. Commerce promotes peace because violence has substantial costs, whether these are paid prospectively or contemporaneously."" The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	105
S9d5a13c2-Afa124b13	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	Labor is now 25% to 35% of fast food costs Con did not contest my specific evidence that labor costs are 25% to 35% of costs in the fast food industry, that a $15 minimum would increase costs by 17% to 20%, Con cites Sen Warren's figure that doubling the minimum at McDonald's would only increase the price of a burger by eight cents. That's unsupported nonsense and probably part of the early mistakes confusing McDonald's Corporation with the franchises. I provided a thoroughly referenced derivation of a minimum of 17% increase in costs. The average McDonald's Big Mac Meal costs $6.74, so a straight increase would be $1.14. In practice, prices would rise less than that with employees being replaced by machines. 2. Increased costs cannot come out of profits Con concedes this point. Prices would rise. 3. A $15 minimum would eliminate about half the jobs Con showed no error in my source. Con referenced the Card and Kreuger (CK) paper (1994) claiming that employment actually increased in fast food restaurants when the minimum wage was raised in New Jersey. A later study by Neumark and Wascher (NW) (1995) [15. http://www.nber.org...] contradicted the result, showing a decrease in employment. NW discovered that CK had relied upon telephone survey data, whereas payroll data showed a different result. The two papers were considered by Roppenen [16. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...] Roppenen found that employment decreased in the large fast food chain restaurants, but increased in small independent fast food restaurants. Fast food restaurants outside of large chains have almost disappeared since 1994. I suspect that growth in independent restaurants has something to do with the economic recovery being different in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the too states compared. NW also pointed out that data variances were very large so the CK results were subject to statistical error. Con referenced the CK paper again with a second link. Con's reference after that is a bogus link. Con then sites a Forbes article that says, “Fifteen dollars an hour is a huge jump from $7.25. It’s outside the range of experience. If you’re an empiricist, you have to say you don’t know what the outcome will be. But it will create some problems with McDonald’s business model.” This is like saying “We have no experience with a large chemical weapons attack on a US city, so we have no empirical data on what would happen.” Nonetheless, we have good reasons to believe it would be bad. There have been many studies of the overall effect of raising the minimum wage. The Congressional Joint Economic Commission surveyed the literature published in the fifty years after World War II. They found only three studies out of 102 cited where a minimum wage increase had no negative effect. In all the others there was a negative effect. The Commission said, “These studies were exhaustively surveyed by the Minimum Wage Study Commission, which concluded that a 10% increase in the minimum wage reduced teenage employment by 1% to 3%.” [17. http://tinyurl.com...] We would expect a few more studies before 2009 to show no significant effect, because the minimum wage has fallen further below the prevailing wage. It's as if we had a minimum wage of $20 per hour for neurosurgeons and raised it to $25. There would be no significant effect because so few neurosurgeons work at such low wage. Before the 2009 recession, only about 2.5% of the population was working at the minimum wage. A study done in those years may show little effect. Most of the state minimum wage hikes were in states with high prevailing wages, making it even less likely for an impact to be observed. Con argued that in general wages are not subject to supply and demand and that any minimum wage increase would therefore have no effect. About a hundred studies contradict that. [Con's falsely generalizes small increases in the minimum to any increase in the minimum. In 1967 the minimum wage was 50% of average wages, now it is 39%. The minimum is now $7.25 and the average wage is $20.08. [18. http://tinyurl.com... ] That is why if raised to $9. countrywide it would have modest effect. At McDonald's workers are generally paid $9, so raising the wage to $15 is a different story. That's an increase from 80% of average to 166% of average. Even though she used the bogus McDonald's numbers, Sen. Warren's hearing was about a small increase, not the $15 proposed for McDonald's, The testimony was that a small raise in the minimum wage would have little effect on the economy as a whole. The studies cited of no impact were from years when only 2.5% worked at the minimum wage. Now 4.7% of workers are at the minimum wage, and most of those part time. [19. http://www.bls.gov...] Even if that group is hurt badly, it is too small a part of the whole economy to have a devastating effect on the nation as whole. Con argues that since full automation did not occur after the 2007 minimum wage increase, none will occur in the future. In fact, automation is incremental. After the comparatively modest 2007 wage increase, McDonald's installed automatic-shutoff drink machines and eliminated one job in twelve. Additional increments of automation are fully-automated drink dispensing, automatic burger flippers, touchscreen order taking, and factory preparation of menu items. Deliberately causing mass inefficiency with artificial increases in labor costs is a net loss of efficiency even there is remediation of part of it with automation. I didn't cite a McDonald's in Tokyo. I cited a competitor that is more easily automated. In Prof. Reich's video he is talking about a raise from $7.25 to $9, not close to what we are debating. He says jobs won't be lost because personal service jobs cannot be automated. In the specific case of fast food I have shown exactly how the jobs can be automated. The only issue is capital costs versus labor costs. If Con argues that supply and demand do not operate on labor. About a hundred studies contradict that. [17] He made the generic argument that the minimum wage has no effect on employment, regardless of the amount. I challenge Con to explain why, under his theory, we should not raise the minimum to $200 per hour. If Con agrees that the amount matters, then he needs to reference the actual numbers for McDonald's. A rise in the minimum cannot be stimulus, because it merely transfers wealth. Con argues that reducing turnover will compensate for increased wages. That depends on the industry, and no one knows more about the McDonald's tradeoffs than McDonald's. Costco is a warehouse store, that's not McDonald's. 4. Welfare should be done by government insofar as it's done at all Con supposes that if the government sets any minimum and if I don't oppose abolishing the minimum entirely, then I've accepted the principle that government is free to set any minimum. If something is bad, it's still valid to discuss an acute case of making it worse. If the minimum is set well below the prevailing wage, it has little effect and isn't worth debating. Con says questioning the role of government is irrelevant. No, the challenge only says that we are weighing advantages versus disadvantages. It is a disadvantage of the $15 per hour minimum that it transfers wealth away from lower and middle income groups to fast food workers, rather than transferring it from the wealthy. The Gini Coefficient is a measure of income equality. Total equality is achieved when all incomes are zero. It is a measure, but not a goal. I showed that fast food is not a monopoly industry. I never said or implied a minimum wage was a free lunch. I said it puts workers out of their jobs. Debate issues Con has the link to the Costco reference used erroneously three times. The CK link is duplicated. I need the real links. Con references Reich's arguments without making the arguments himself. They should be ignored.	PRO	106
Sda116120-A19c67ab6	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	"Many thanks to Wylted for this debate, and participation in this series. I'm going to use this round to talk about some of the problems with the Fair Tax, and I'll rebut PRO in the following round. Now, I'm only going to talk about why the Fair Tax -referred to hereafter as FT- is bad policy. Here's why: Impact to Individuals: If implemented, the FT would replace all federal taxes, and instead impose 23% national sales tax on all retail goods and services to allow workers to ""keep"" all of their earnings. That figure is misleading, but for the sake of argument, let's proceed as if it were the case. On the day of FT's coming to effect, federal withholding will stop. Assuming workers paid 23% of their income in taxes before, and they spent all of their income annually, they are no better or worse off financially under the present tax system or under FT. Under FT, on April 15, a worker subject to FT has the additional benefit of not having to file taxes. But, if a worker spends all of his annual income and pays more than 23% of his income in taxes under the present scheme, then he is better off just as sure as a worker who pays less than 23% is worse off. The overwhelming majority of American's now pay less than 23% of their annual income in taxes. (1) Indeed, only those who make more than $207,000.00 pay more than 23% of their income in taxes, now. To solve this problem, FT scheme proposes to send out monthly ""prebates"" to everyone based on 23% of poverty rate income, to be paid out in monthly installments of about $196.00/month to cover ""the necessities of life."" (1) But, that payment is not distributed on the basis of need -but on the basis of existence. As Bartlett (2007) observes, ""There is no income or consumption test for the rebate. It would go equally to those with zero income and those who buy nothing in the course of a month, as well as to billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates."" By implication, the ""prebate"" proposed to correct for FT's inherent regressiveness amounts to the creation of a ""national welfare program"" in which ""there is essentially no relationship between the rebate and the cost of living or raising children."" (1) Even still, FT's revenue neutrality rests on the erroneous assumption that ""no matter how large a family's income, 100% of it is consumed every year,"" which is not the case. In reality, the percentage of a person's income being consumed by expenses falls as income rates rise. Low income families may even spend far more than their annual income -especially retirees who supplement income with savings accumulated over a lifetime. (1) By implication, were FT was implemented, however, retirees who supplement their income with savings accumulated during a time when personal income was taxed would in effect be subject to double taxation on that income on ""everything they buy"" ranging from groceries to health care. (1) Moreover, the FT's implementation would disproportionally harm young workers in the process of establishing their livelihoods as they purchase first cars, homes and pay for childcare. (1) It is inconceivable that the prebate's $196.00 month payment could offset those disproportionate impacts. Likewise, given that not all families -especially wealthy families- consume the totality of their annual income, the result of FT's implementation would be ""an enormous shift in the tax burden from the wealthy to those with lower and middle incomes."" (1) The FT's Faulty Economic Logic: FT's advocates have an annoying tendency to talk out of both sides of their mouth: on the one hand, they hypothesize that ""after tax incomes will rise by enough to pay the higher prices for goods and services once the 23 percent is added to the prices people pay today"" but on the other, they contend that ""prices will fall once income taxes currently embedded in prices are removed."" (1) Sounds good, right? Especially considering that rebate -which would be unnecessary if either were the case. The reality is that you can't have both gains in post-tax income and depreciating prices once embedded taxes are vacated, because the two are mutually exclusive. (1) Bartlett (2007) observed that ""it is unclear whether [FT] supporters are genuinely ignorant of this fact or dishonestly implying that both will happen so that they can build support for their plan."" (1) But, even that's wishful thinking. FT proponents assume thatwage-transition in response to FT's implementation could be facilitated as rapidly as tax policy could be changed. In practice, Carlton (1986) demonstrates that wages and prices are far more static than FT advocates believe, because consumer prices are far more strictly contingent upon monetary policy and inflation levels than tax rates (1, 2). So, in that it would be unreasonable to expect prices to quickly adjust to the FT unless the Fed drastically increased the money supply, which would result in unstable inflation at levels that would equally drastically destabilize the value of the dollar while not increasing real earnings at all. The FT's impact on wages is similarly predictable: Bartlett (2007) continues, for prices will instantaneously fall once status quo federal taxation is abolished ""wages must fall"" because ""if wages don't fall, there is no way to get a reduction in prices."" (1) But because workers are hostile to nominal wage cuts (whether their income tax is withheld or not), to avoid the market destabilization that would nationally follow such a drastic change in tax policy it's probable that ""the federal reserve will increase the money supply enough to allow the price level to rise by 23% so workers won't have to cut their nominal wages."" (1) The tax burden, then, would just be passed off to consumers in the form of higher prices. (1) but if prices rise proportionally to avoid wage cuts, once more NO ONE IS BETTER OFF. But when calculating revenues, FT's advocates assume that price levels are going to remain constant even though when calculating the FT's impact on individual's disposable income rates, they assume that prices will rise by the FT's percentage itself. Both can't be the case, but each are options and they are contingent upon what the Fed decides to do in response. Either the Fed can adopt an accommodative monetary policy, or it can not. If the former, then ""the money supply would be increased enough so that nominal wages would not have to fall and prices would rise by the amount of the tax"" which would result in a real wage cut. Sure, prices would be higher but incomes would be too and aggregate standards of living would remain unchanged. (1) If the later, pre-tax prices would fall relative to the FT's percentage but nominal wages would also take a commensurate dive that would have an overwhelmingly negative economic impact. (1) Given those options, it would be inconceivable that the Fed wouldn't adopt an accommodative monetary policy -but that means that prices also aren't going to fall and ""workers are going to lose whatever they think they might gain from the elimination of income taxation."" (1) In effect, there is no reason whatsoever to adopt the FT because at best it's a wash, and at worst it's incredibly economically dangerous. But why might it be dangerous? Let's find out. The FT is Dangerous: FT's allies generally find themselves in support of it because they detest the IRS. Neal Boortz and John Linders's 2005 book ""The Fair Tax Book"" clams that the IRS, which he describes as one of the US's ""most hated institutions"" will be sent to ""the government guano heap of history."" (3) That's... colorful but even more, it's duplicitous because as Lawrence Vance (2005) decried, ""calling the IRS by another name doesn't mean that its functions will be eliminated. Just as the income tax will be replaced by the FairTax, so the IRS will be replaced by some other federal bureaucracy to oversee the collection of the fair tax."" (4) Moreover, the FairTax creates an entirely new method of collecting taxes without precluding those already in existence while likewise creating entirely new kinds of taxes and entirely new varieties of tax collectors. (4) Where previously the federal government had no means to collect taxes on all sold goods and services, the FT would create an apparatus to do so -and it would create that apparatus without repealing the 16th Amendment. So, Vance (2005) asks, ""what is there to prevent a [federal] income tax from being from being imposed after a national sales tax has been enacted?"" Nothing. (4) Similarly, due to the increased transactional costs the FT would impose on state and local government, it is entirely foreseeable that the FT would actually necessitate states increasing their income tax rates just to achieve revenue neutrality. (1, 4) The FT would therefore not only make it easier for the federal government to raise taxes, but it would also increase the mechanisms at their disposal to tax -while at the same time not eliminating all federal taxes by any measure. We can know this because the FairTax Act makes no mention of repealing the federal excise tax on gasoline nor the federal taxes imposed on numerous other things like airline tickets. (4) With that, there is absolutely no reason to adopt the FairTax. Its proponents have either intentionally or unintentionally misrepresented or overstated its benefits, overlooked numerous potential harms and all to the end of achieving something that may not even be revenue neutral. I'll talk more about that in later rounds. Sources (1) ""Why the FairTax Won't Work."" Bruce Bartlett. Tax Analysts Special Report. TAX NOTES. December 24, 2007. (2) ""The Rigidity of Prices.""

Scde43845-A5e0eda55	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Pro argues that a survey of ""83 responders"" in 2006 is evidence that free trade is agreed to by the majority. But Pro's sample is unrepresentative and outdated. In March 2012, Harvard economist Dani Rodrik writes that, in ""real surveys with representative samples,"" ""respondents favor trade restrictions by a two-to-one margin."" [7] Pro sometimes argues against particular protections. But to the few arguments I made for protections, Pro offers no counter. Pro does not even mention my argument for balancing trade via Buffet's ""import certificates."" Peace and Human Rights War is waged regardless of trade policy, usually on ideological grounds. Britain has fought more wars than any other nation, sometimes openly with the aim of imposing free trade on reluctant nations (that's how Hong Kong became British). Post-WWII Japan has been blatantly protectionist, but has had a more peaceful foreign policy than free trading America. The U.S. is also the biggest terrorist target, regardless of its free trade policy. In The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein exposes free trade and its relation to human rights violation. Besides some obvious examples like South Africa and China, she provides the US-backed Pinochet regime in Chile: by the early 80s, the Milton Friedman-prescribed policies had led to a huge “crisis of corruption,” “rapid de-industrialization, a tendfold increase in unemployment and an explosion of distinctly unstable shantytowns.” The only way to keep free trade going was human rights abuse. Comparative Advantage Pro claims that ""progress of all types leads to displacements,"" and that ""lost jobs"" from free trade are simply the displacement of ""jobs to competitive industries."" Pro's reasoning is dubious. Pro assumes workers can move easily between industries. If they can't, imports won't push a nation's economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage. Instead, imports will just kill off existing industries and leave nothing in its place. There are workers without the right skills or who don't live in the right place to move between industries -- those will be left unemployed. The problem is compounded because of relatively low minimum wage and hire-and-fire labor laws in the United States. As a result, we often see a decline not only in the quantity of jobs but in the quality of jobs. We see $28 an hour ex-autoworkers making $8 at a video rental store. Economist Robert Skidelsky argues that this is what happened in Russia: ""about one million scientists have moved into non-intellectual occupations since 1991."" [8] In Moscow, there were physics PhD's who were driving taxis. The human cost is obvious, but there is an economic one as well: when skills that cost money to acquire (for example, physics) are never used again, the economy negates large investments in human capital. These losses put the whole economy at risk. As Yale economist and Nobel Laureate James Tobin famously put it, ""it takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap."" A Harberger triangle is the area in a supply and demand diagram that measures the loss of taxation (plainly, these are the benefits of free trade). An Okun gap is the loss in output and employment when the economy falls below potential. Tobin's point is that the benefits of free trade are small compared to the huge cost of not running our economy at full capacity due to imports and lost jobs. Trade Deficits Pro admits that trade deficits are bad. Pro also concedes the results of studies proving the possibility of a better U.S. economy if we end deficit trading. Pro insists trade deficits are not related to free trade, and completely ignores the fact that free trade allows deficit trading to happen in the first place. Let me go through the logic step-by-step: 1) Nations engage in trade 2) One cannot get goods for free 3) When the value of imports is not covered by the value of exports, nations must make up the difference by sellling their assets or assuming debt. 4) Free trade allows trade deficits. The correct trade policy is to end free trade by pragmatically balancing trade. If the United States adopts a policy of free trade, then government allows deficit trading. Pro agrees the consequences of deficit trading are unacceptable. Pro understands that, when a nation exhausts its ability to sell assets and assume debt, it ends up poorer than it would have been if it had not had free trade to begin with. The U.S. prefers short-term consumption as opposed to long-term variety. Americans consume more than they produce, maximizing imports by assuming debt and selling assets. The evidence is not subtle, including a staggering net foreign ownership of $3.5 trillion in American assets and an ever-increasing debt. Pro claims the federal deficit is independent of trade deficit. No. When trade deficits produce debt, the U.S. pays interest on that debt, which is calculated as part of the federal deficit. Pro argues that our trade deficit is a savings problem in disguise. Pro misunderstands the hard economics, and assumes that the arithmetic relationship between trade deficits and saving rates is a causal one. In national income accounting, our savings are the excess of our production over our consumption. Trade deficits are the exact opposite, occurring when we consume more than we produce. We can see clearly that saving rates and trade deficits are exactly the same thing expressed in a different way. There is no causal relation between the two. The decision to eat a cookie does not cause the decision to not save the cookie -- it is the same decision. Externalities Free trade cannot account for negative and positive externalities. Because environmental damage is not factored into equations, free trade encourages pollution when it offers a cost advantage. There are other externalities like technological spillover. Pro offers no response. Competition Pro claims that non-competitive industries will be discontinued in favor of ""high-tech"" competitive industries. It turns out that airlines, which are Pro's single well-chosen example, is the only ""high-tech"" good the U.S. is a net exporter of. [9] The U.S. is a net importer of every other high-tech good, including spacecraft. This raises the question of where the jobs have gone? Pro does not give any evidence of new jobs or increased income from free trade. How can the U.S. cover the cost of imports? There are three options: increasing the price of exports, selling assets, or borrowing on credit. The first dramatically raises the price of domestic goods; the other two produce a trade deficit. Either way, consumers and workers lose. Income Inequality Pro misunderstands the Stolper-Samuelson theorem and its results. It says that, as a result of free trade, people who draw most of their income from returns on capital (the rich) gain, while people who get most of their income from labor (the rest of us) lose. Because the U.S. has more capital per person, and fewer workers per dollar capital than the rest of the world, free trade tends to hurt American workers. For skilled jobs, foreign labor is just as expensive as American labor, so there is no impact on American wages. The occupations that suffer are those whose products are easily produced by cheap labor abroad. This includes most blue-collar jobs, which accounts for the majority of U.S. workers. This means that even if free trade performs in other respects (it doesn't), it would still leave most Americans with lower incomes. And even if it increased our economy overall (it doesn't), it would still unfairly increase poverty and income inequality. Evidence Pro claims I have no evidence. Besides other examples like Chile, take Pro's example of Brazil: from 1987 to 2005, it was found that trade liberalization contributed to poverty and inequality in urban areas where the rich now live side-by-side with Third World squalor.

S554eb968-Afc039778	Taxes should be raised on the rich	"My Case C1: Laffer Curve ""Thus, logically in the economy today, we would find only businesses that seek to make a profit if this were true, but it isn't. Non-profit organizations/volunteers have absolutely NO profit motive, that is, they make 0 dollars, and they have no income taxes to pay as a result."" Were only talking about individuals that do work, specifically the rich who act as businessmen in the economy. The main purpose of business is to maximize profits as much as possible after providing a good or service. We are not talking about a corporate or business tax, but mainly the income and capital gains tax. [1] Income tax and capital gains taxes are used mainly on the people for money. Liberals advocate higher taxes on the rich through income and capital gains. Corporate taxes is strictly different to take profits from a company, so my opponent is now confusing me. C2: History I. Harding-Coolidge Tax Cuts My opponent cites the Wikipedia article of Warren G. Harding as his source for this. I believe Wikipedia is an alright source to use, but simply citing the president who did not even serve for the dominance of the 1920s or instituted the most major of the tax cuts is a bad example of a source. Coolidge was a huge veto president who stopped all farm subsidies proposed by Congress and repealed Harding's farm subsidies. The government was reduced by over 20 percent and the debt went from $28 billion to $17.65 billion. My opponent is wrong here that th debt was entirely payed off. Finally, it was not the farming industry that was the big boom of the Roaring Twenties. According to Shlaes: ""In July 1921, there had been 5.7 million Americans out of work; now that figure was 1.8 million. Manufacturing output was up by a third since that time. Iron and steel production had doubled. They might not complete many more tax cuts, but the revenue acts of 1921, 1924, 1926, and 1928 represented a strong record."" [2] What we can see here is that the huge economic boom was not from agriculture, but from industry. Unemployed Americans went into factories not farms and the expansion of these industries shows. If we look at the percentages of Americans owning specific goods: Cars: 26% to 60% Radios: 0% to 46% Electric Lighting: 35% to 68% Washing Machines: 8% to 24% Vacuum Cleaners: 9% to 30% Flush Toilers: 20% to 51% [3] For more on Coolidge see the video. II. Kennedy Tax Cuts My numbers for the Kennedy tax cuts are specific to the benefits created by them and they found that the unions and death penalty had little effect. The death penalty has actually been found to create deterrence to crime and create less violence which means more economic growth. One of the key factors in investments for new projects was that the capital gains taxes was much lower back then and the Kennedy tax cut fueled investment. On the death penalty: ""The early empirical research on the subject by Issac Ehrlich has demonstrated strong deterrent effects by the death penalty, and has responded to most criticism of his work. Meanwhile, other studies have come out to prove the deterrent hypothesis. Some economists noted how the models used in the studies were not robust, but the authors of the studies in question have refuted these analysis’s and noted they actually tried to reduce the deterrent effect by various tests but have found these results simply don’t go away. They are robust and correct."" [4] III. Reagan Tax Cuts Once again, my data looks at Reagan's specific tax cuts and how they affected the economy specifically. The income tax on the rich went down from 70% to 28%, so we do know he cut taxes on the rich. The capital gains taxes remained the same until an increase in 1986 which lost revenue. Keep in mind, that by then it took time for any change is Reagan's tax policy to take effect. In 1981 he signed his first cut, but it had little effect until a year later when unemployment had peaked to nearly 11%. When it went into full effect, it went down to nearly 7%. This proof of the effect it had. [6] C3: Income Mobility I have proven subisidies of agriculture did not work, most were either vetoed or eliminated under Coolidge, so this point is easily refuted. In the 1980s, the middle class dropped by 5 points from 53.9% to 49.2%. The income of this 5% was found to specifically move up because they now had more money. Like I said, those owning more than $50,000 received a 5% increase in their group. [5] My Refutations R1: Higher Taxes do not Benefit Dropped. R2: Capital Gains It said in my source that if the capital gains tax is cut or completely eliminated, we would receive a huge amount of jobs. Thus the source favors me. He really never refuted my Gilder point. R3: History It has been proven that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression from several studies. I will post a video for those who are interested, but we were only discussing taxes and not the New Deal. During the Great Depression, Hoover and FDR both raised taxes from 25% to over 90%. It was a disaster if you look at the unemployment among jobless non-farm workers. Unemployment was over 20% during the Great Depression and my opponent has admitted it backfired through the second Great Depression in 1938. We then get a Greater Depression from the New Deal and the government in World War 2. Thus, the Great Depression did not end until 1948. The Cole-Ohanian study proved that the New Deal did not work. Instead they should have done a more free market approach: ""Our results suggest that New Deal policies are an important contributing factor tothe persistence of the Great Depression. The key depressing element behind these policies firms to collude with paying high wages. Our model indicates that these policies reduced consumption, and investment about 14 percent relative to their competitive balanced growth path levels. Thus, the model accounts for about half of the continuation of the Great Depression between 1934 and 1939."" [7] In fact, FDR's attempts at taxation were so awful that he most notably: ""FDR raised taxes higher than Hoover did with the Wealth Tax Act (or Revenue Act of 1935) which raised the top rate to a staggering 79%. If anything, it held more politics than it did revenue because only John D. Rockefeller (the richest man in the country at the time) could pay at such a high bracket."" [8] R4: Economically Alienated Under Reagan, the average income of the poorest fifth of the population increased from $6,494 in 1980 to $6,994 in 1989. The poor did quite well under Reagan. This is also not the only case in which the rich payed more of the tax burden than the poor.

Sda116120-A53e3c38f	Classic Robert Gauntlet Tournament: The current tax system should be replaced by the fair tax.	Introduction The I.R.S. Sux. Most people agree with thishttp://www.gallup.com... . Pretty much everyone wants to see tax reform. Whether that comes from closing loopholes or reducing the burden on the middle class. It's just confusing as to how to solve a ton of the problems caused by the current tax system. The Fairtax is the best known available solution to the current system. It's bipartisan and provides just as much if not more revenue for the federal government http://people.bu.edu... . Politicians don't like the fairtax because they can't reward friends and punish enemies using the tax code, but that's one of the reasons why it's so great. It should be noted that 61% of people wan a more fair tax system http://www.rasmussenreports.com... and most people once they understand what the fairtax is become staunch supporters of it. (minute 8:30 in Youtube video http://www.youtube.com...). Revenue Neutral This tax code is revenue neutral. Whatever amount you were expecting from the current tax code would match what this new tax system brings in. http://people.bu.edu... . So all the benefits I bring up about the fairtax don't come at a cost to the government's revenue stream. Tax Burden The Fairtax is a progressive tax system. The tax in essence untaxes the poor. The prebate ensures that the Fairtax is progressive. A family spending at the poverty level would spend 0% on taxes. Somebody spending at twice the poverty level would pay a 12% tax. Millionaires would pay a 23% tax. How is it Revenue Neutral Well let's remember the current tax code only taxes 100 million people. The new tax code would pull from a pool of 300 million people, plus tourists. We'd also tax a lot of the wealth we've had no access to before, some of that wealth may be from drug dealers, or tax dodgers or new higher paying jobs provided by the massive amounts of corporations flooding into America after the corporate tax is abolished. It's estimated that the GDP would rise by 10.5 % in the first year http://patriotstatesman.com... . Corporations There's this myth that corporations are taxed. They aren't. They either pass on these tax costs to investors, employees or customers. When they feel like passing on these costs to the customer will hurt business too much, they up and leave the United States. Like Google did and shifted 80% of their pretax income to Bermuda http://www.huffingtonpost.com... . There are a ton of corporations leaving the U.S. and flocking to low tax/no tax countries like Switzerland or Ireland http://www.informationclearinghouse.info... . This is money that could be staying in America, not to mention money that would come to the United states from other corporations flocking to the United States to avoid taxation. It's been estimated by economists that corporations pass on this tax at the cost of 22% of every dollar you spend on their merchandise. http://www.fairtaxblog.com... . Once the fair tax is implemented the total cost of products would likely remain unchanged. So what we're talking about here is eliminating all federal taxes, implementing the fairtax and still barely affecting the total cost of products while increasing or keeping tax revenue the same. Once you eliminate the corporate tax. Corporations will flock to the United States providing tons of new jobs and also new pools of income to be taxed. Boortz, Neal; Linder, John (2006). The Fair Tax Book (Paperback ed.). Regan Books. ISBN 0-06-087549-6. Bill Archer a former head of The House Ways and means committee headed a survey of 500 European and Asian countries. When surveyed 400 said they would build their next plant in the United States. 100 said that They would move their headquarters here. http://www.actionamerica.org... Besides bringing all these jobs and corporations home, we'll also have American companies that are way more competitive overseas. They are no longer passing on the costs of taxation to foreigners. Because of taxes American businesses are already at a 17% disadvantage when competing overseas. Enacting the fairtax would immediately eliminate this disadvantage and help American companies immensely. http://en.wikipedia.org... Banking It's nonsense that Americans have billions of dollars in offshore accounts making Swiss bankers rich, when this money can be in America making American bankers rich and providing more tax revenue. It's estimated that 11 trillion dollars is in offshore accounts. This number is increasing by 800 billion dollars a year. http://www.taxjustice.net... Alan Greenspan has estimated that a large portion of this money would be repatriated boosting the economy instead of the economy of tax haven countries and it would increase the pool of taxable money. Boortz, Neal; Linder, John (2006). The Fair Tax Book (Paperback ed.). Regan Books. ISBN 0-06-087549-6. Conclusion The fairtax plan boosts the economy as estimated by as stated by over 80 economists including Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith, in a letter to the president. http://www.fairtax.org... . It's revenue neutral http://people.bu.edu... . The Fair tax is progressive due to the tax prebate. The Fairtax decreases most people's tax burdens. the Fairtax is just over 130 pages long as opposed to the 15,000 plus pages, which are changed daily in the current tax code. This is a more honest and clearly better way to collect taxes. There is no reason not to replace the current tax system with the fairtax.	PRO	110

S9d5a13c2-Ae8a1341a	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	Summary We know McDonald’s current cost structure. Raising the minimum wage at McDonald's would raise costs by 17% to 20%. That's $1.14 on a typical meal. Customers, mainly the poor and middle class, would pay more and they would tend to eat out less often. The fast food business would shrink, losing jobs. Higher labor costs makes more automation cost effective, so McDonald’s would install more equipment and further reduce the numbers of jobs. We know what McDonald’s can do for automation, like automatic drink machines and touchscreen order entry. They would reduce the number of entry-level jobs. By forcing the prices higher than required, the economy suffers from lowered efficiency. Taxpayers will end up paying unemployment benefits and welfare to the low-skilled workers who lose jobs. Prices will rise 17% to 20% and half the employees will be laid off We agree prices will rise, a strong disadvantage, with the amount in dispute. Con's entire price and unemployment case is built upon a single study (CK) that compared what happened in 1994 when New Jersey raised its minimum wage but Pennsylvania did not. If the study were valid, one case is inadequate to establish that the minimum wage has no effect on employment no matter what the industry, the prevailing wage, and the state of automation technology. 99 of 102 studies on raising the minimum wage showed bad effects, and that's not overcome by one study that shows the contrary. We don't know if there were other differences affecting general economic growth in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Saying that one example amounts to a law of nature is the fallacy of hasty generalization. However, the CK study was bogus, relying on a telephone survey that produced numbers with a very large spread. The study was contradicted by in 1995 by Neumark, who followed up by checking payroll data. Con says that a 2005 study attempted to resurrect the one case establishing minimum wage having no effect on employment, but he didn't provide a link to that study. However, the most recent study by Roppenen [16] in 2011 showed that CK was in error, and that employment dropped in the large fast food chains. Con explains that Sen Warren's claim of the price of rising eight cents came from the CK study, which claimed an 8% rise in prices. Con says “Both the [CK] study and the increase we're debating about increased wages about 18% found the same numbers.” Actually, we are debating an increase for $7.25 to $15. That is 107%, is 5.93 times 18%. If an 18% rise in wages produces an 8% rise in prices, then a 107% increase should product something closer to 45%. I'm claiming less than half that. To get to an eight cent rise in the price of a hamburger, the Senator must have used the promotional one dollar hamburger, and pretended that was what a McDonald's customer would typically purchase just one of those and nothing else. The Senator's calculation is fraudulent. The current minimum wage rise is much larger, the current economics of McDonald's applies – not 1994, and the average customer does not purchase a single one dollar burger. The analysis showed that costs would rise 17% to 20%. Applying that to the Big Mac Meal, more typical than a single $1 burger, produces a rise of $1.14 for a typical transaction. Con quotes a completely general Wikipedia article that says the classic supply and demand model does not always work because sometimes the assumptions are not met. Con did not make any of the arguments in the article himself, nor did he show how it applies to McDonald's. Wikipedia is not, in any case a valid source for opinions. Con needs to show that people will buy McDonald's hamburgers at the same rate regardless of price, and that McDonald's won't automate to lower costs despite the clear ways they can proceed to do so. I quoted a survey of published papers that showed the trend in job loses with minimum wage increases. Half the fast food jobs will go. I challenged Con to show that McDonald's jobs were so skilled that employee retention would save as much as it was claimed to at Costco. Costco is mainly a logistics company, finding many thousands of products, negotiating prices, arranging supply routes, and stocking warehouse stores. Those are high skill jobs were retaining employees saves training and recruitment. Not so McDonald's, who has no problem finding and training applicants. Con made preposterous unjustified assumptions of replacement costs. Con says, “My opponent drops that MW has been around for years due to it's effectiveness, ...” Debate fans will recognize the ad populum fallacy: that because something has been around for a long time, it must be a good thing. Smoking was around for centuries, and it wasn't a good thing. I did not accept that the minimum wage has been around for years due to its effectiveness. It's around because foolish politicians think they are doing good, and because it gets them votes. I said whether it is a good thing or not, we can debate the effects of doubling it in the fast food industry. I presented a survey showing that in 99 of 102 studies, the minimum wage increases had bad effects. Con did not respond with counter evidence. I challenged Con to explain why the minimum wage should not be raised to $200, given his argument that supply and demand did not apply to labor. He did not respond. Con says, “My opponent drops my monopsonistic argument favouring businesses unfairly.” I did not drop it. I responded that McDonald's had many competitors for labor. A monopsony is when there is one buyer. Not only are there many companies buying labor, but anyone can start their own company. If Con is correct that supply and demand do not operate on burgers, he or anyone can start a hamburger stand, charge $100 a burger and pay employees $200 an hour. The argument is nonsense. Supply and demand are operative, and there is plenty of active competition for both burgers and labor. Con says, “My opponent drops that MW may cause tech improvements, and his contradicting claims in RD2(prices).” I treated this at length. I said that raising the minimum wage causes price increases, and that some of the increase is absorbed by replacing jobs by automation. Con seems to believe that automation necessarily lowers costs and improves efficiency. That's not true, and I said so. If it were more efficient to increase automation at present wage levels, McDonald's would have already done so. Capital costs compete with labor costs. Raising labor costs artificially allows automation to be increased to save some money, but costs will still be higher than if labor costs were not increased. Higher wages won't attract more labor into the market because we already have large surpluses at low skill levels. Gini Coefficient I correctly said that having all wages zero produces a 0 Gini coefficient. The studies Con cites assume that per capita income is equal. That says that if the average income is the same, it's better to have fewer poor people. The Gini coefficient for the United States is 0.38, whereas about the best in Europe is Greece, at 0.33. [20. http://en.wikipedia.org...] So should we strive to be more like Greece? The problem is that achieving a lower coefficient by forced redistribution of wealth also necessary lowers the total wealth, because it allocates capital inefficiently. Con argued that transferring wealth from McDonald’s customers to McDonald’s employees will produce stimulus. Con produced no evidence that McDonald's customers were so wealthy as to be less likely to spend the money more readily than McDonald's employees. It's fundamentally unfair to transfer wealth from customers. -------------- Con had few sources relevant to current McDonald's economics, he declined to fix broken and bogus links, and he relied almost entirely on one doubtful study. Con repeatedly claims that I have dropped arguments when I did not. Thanks to Con for a debate that thoroughly covered the subject.	PRO	112
S5d12ad-A8090b5d0	US Prisoners Should Have Access To Prostitutes	Resolution: The Federal Government shall establish and regulate a system of prostitution in America's prisons and jails. Debate Structure: R1 Acceptance R2 Opening arguments R3 Rebuttals to round 2 arguments R4 Rebuttals to round 3 arguments and conclusion Deviation from the structure should result in a full loss of points for the offender.To give people an idea of what I'm proposing before they consider accepting this debate, I'll lay it out a bit now. Prisoners have accounts with money in them. The state/feds give(s) them a minimum amount monthly, and they can earn more from good behavior and doing extra work. This money is spent on food and extra luxuries, like a second pillow or something of that nature. Under the system I propose, the Federal Government would have the prostitutes priced in a way that allows them to be attainable for prisoners without some extreme amount of saving up (like a year, they wouldn't have to save for that long). This would not be for profit, it would be paid for by whatever the prisoners can throw in, and then taxpayer dollars. As far as prostitute safety goes, they will be under whatever surveillance seems necessary to offer them protection. My opponent is free to argue that the prostitutes would be abused with this system, but if they were part of the Federal Government, and had, for lack of a better word, 'handlers' who they could report their abuses to, abuses would be a small problem. If there are any further questions about my proposition please ask before accepting.	PRO	113
S38f1c3c6-Af3e9828d	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"I. Observation/Resolutions This argument relies heavily on my opponents understanding that this debate is only over instances in where resource extraction is directly conflicting with environmental protection. This is not the resolution, which explicitly states that ""Developing Countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction"". This is outrageous, and a double fallacy. Has the opponent considered that there are other ways to protect the environment over than extracting resources? Which leaves this contention broken. If this were to be true, then the resolution would be advocating that all forms of environmental protection not correlating with resource extraction should also be prioritized. My opponent was not firmly clear on this, or said anything about it at all. None the less, my points still stand. This debate also involves instances where environmental protection don't correlate with resource extraction, and vice versa. If the resolution followed this observation, it would say ""In times where environmental protection and resource extraction come in conflict, resource extraction should come first. II. OP's understanding of direct conflict I am trying very hard to make my opponent understand, that all forms of resource extraction harm the environment. She seems to keep ignoring this, and engaging in guerrilla straw man in other places about this. Is there one form of resource extraction that doesn't harm the environment? Irrigation hurts the ground and roots, farming tires soil (farms eventually produce less over time), with modern day farming killing 10000's of bugs per farm that are integral in the ecosystem. Have people seen certain fungicides these days? Farming is one of the biggest causes of pollution. My opponent cannot continue to deny that there are two categories of resource extraction. Every resource hurts the environment, so even if my opponent were correct on her direct conflict rule, then she would be conceding several points she accused earlier. Michigan is the resource drain, and my opponent will have trouble naming even one collected resource that doesn't harm the environment. I really want to know if she can, and since she hasn't, all of the points made on this subject should be disregarded. Even innocent things like fishing cause water pollution and hurt the ecosystem (By Darwin's theory, animals live in a connected food chain). III. C1: Developing nations should create surplus wealth before buying green technology My opponents one rebuttal is that the people will never see this money, as the elite hold it. This is unrelated and off topic. Her straw man covered up the fact that she conceded that the surplus wealth should be used on green technology. What she didn't answer, is how green technology can be bought without surplus wealth? She responded to the contention, sure, but she dropped the point. Green technology is more expensive than base technology, so you need to make money before it can be bought. This is simple economics. Since this point is dropped, the bop is not filled, and my opponent should lose the debate from this alone. I do not write contentions just to see them straw manned and dropped. I have better things to do than engage in a debate with such silly argumentation. Which is why I recommend the audience to seriously consider the dropped point here when casting their votes. IV. Corruption I have been ignoring this argument due to a lack of gravity and weight, but since my opponent is insisting on bringing it up time after time, I will be forced to refute this. The point here is weak, and unrelated to the debate. Even if it held any weight at all, there is evidence more surplus is created than siphoned into slush accounts. Take Kenya for example They have the richest oil in the world, and the fourth largest reserves in the planet. It is also the most corrupt resource rich nation. http://www.transparency.org... Even though Kenya is the most corrupt nation with resource rich land, only 41% of value (forex) is being funneled through corrupt networks, which means 59% is still being created as surplus. My opponents case is debunk, by me proving worst case scenarios still work. Also, this argument has nothing to do with the resolution. Qatar and South Korea are examples of nations who've controlled corruption while still having resources. Corruption is a government policy issue that doesn't relate very well to the debate, and is also to big a problem to generalize. V. C2: Concession (yay) on process and understanding of surplus There are two things which pretty much seal this debate. One, is that the opposition outright conceded that you need to make money before you can protect the environment. This greatly damages her case. Then she moves on to claim that nations already have surplus. THIS IS FALSE!!!!. Developing nations almost never have surplus wealth. That is why they have budgets, and the government is trying to slowly grow them so they can just break even on new buys. The little money in stock they have, would be thrown into environmental protection, instead of the new harbor the citizens of Lwore have been waiting 8 years to see built. There are a couple common factors among third world nations.... 1. Extreme Poverty 2. High Unemployment 3. Corruption/Infighting The last of their concerns being environmental protection. The citizens don't need new solar panels. They want more jobs, social programs, and a lot more security. Ask a starving child what he wants most, and he'll say food, not a windmill. Its not developing nations that hurt the environment the most. It's industrialized ones. By having nations spend all their spare money on technology they can't afford, you are holding back their standard of living and development as a whole. These nations need to save every cents they have just to create the wealth they need to afford luxuries such as environmental protection. VI. Another Concession (Yay) and restatements on where wealth is going I would like to state once again, my opponent has conceded this contention. Before bringing up another concern. She says, once again, in a repetitive and rhetorical manner, that the people never see the wealth anyways. I would ask her, who is working the mines? Who's making these people rich? Even in societies where the money flows to the top, there is still a great deal of wealth going to the bottom. Not enough I grant you, but enough to justify this contention. Slowly overtime, nations standards of living are increasing, and more people are being lifted from poverty. So my opponent is wrong. Not all money hits the top. Maybe once we have 23% less people living under 1.25$ a day, then we can talk, but my contention is not only true, but as you can see, it has already been tested. We can banter about how the elites take all are money as much as we want, but only a foolish economist would deny that we're seeing at least some of it being spread around. Which is where the BOP fails. VII. Scarcity in resources For the record, I can't concede an argument you didn't make. She straw manned her own argument. Also, this rebuttal, is actually just her restating the very argument I just refuted. Or in layman's terms, dropped my points again. I want a definite answer. If resources eventually run out, then will we make more money extracting them in lump sums, or slowly over time. In to which I argued that having money in circulation can create wealth without commodities, to which I got no response. Anyone macro economics would tell you the same things. Having 2 billion dollars now, could create 10 billion later. Without commodities even being a factor. VIII. Conclusion My opponent has not upheld her BOP. She put some strong points forward, but there were to many conceded contentions, dropped premises, logical fallacies , straw mans, among other things which make this a definite one sided win. The burden of proof is a serious thing, and should be considered to its fullest extent. My opponent conceded all three of my contentions, with her only defense being weak ""buts...."" which relied on X factors not involved in the debate. A conceded point is a failed BOP. Much less having three concessions. Vote Con! Sources http://bauscharddebate.com... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov..."	CON	114
S554eb968-Ac9fc3214	Taxes should be raised on the rich	"Those two videos were an attempt to add in more material while getting passed the character limit. They certainly do not fall under the character limit, I ask they be dismissed due to violation of the rules. Re1: The Laffer Curve I was arguing the fact that because of volunteering initiatives and non-profit organizations, we can see that your Laffer curve should be rejected. It fails to take into account all actors of the economy, and in this case my opponent dropped the fact that even Laffer himself later noted it should not be the only basis for justifying raising or lowering taxes. I did note volunteering on an individual basis in my previous arguments. Re2: The Harding-Coolidge Tax Cuts Didn't Cause the “Roaring Twenties” First of all, I stated that paying off some of the debt is good economically. Secondly, Coolidge himself forced the top 2% of income earners during his time to pay any income taxes at all, which also furthers my point as we're disguising increasing taxes on the wealthy, and thirdly, my opponent misunderstood my argument, I was speaking about Harding's subsidies, and his investments in technology which paid off, same as Coolidge which caused the roaring twenties in the first place, not tax cuts. Finally, when cutting taxes, the depression kicked in at the end of the 20's, my article notes that the sugar high was met with the crash of Wall street and the world enters the depression. Coolidge in fact had such a lack of regulation on the economy, it was almost invincible. As the following article shows, there is absolutely no economic correlation between tax cuts and spurred economic activities: http://www.forbes.com... In fact, it shows that under the Clinton administration the tech boom also took place. The difference is that we got into a recession (not nearly as bad as a depression, especially with higher tax rates Clinton pushed), and no tech investments or economic activities ceased or slowed because of taxes as per my other articles I noted as well. Re3: Unions and CP Abolishes Do Have Good Economic Consequences Under JFK, Not Tax Cuts CP (Capital punishment) does not in fact have a deterrence as agreed upon by a majority of criminologists http://www.amnesty.org... . California got rid of their CP same as New Jersey and New York, and all saved huge sums of money. Shortage of lawyers, and appeals costs more otherwise the rule of law is sacrificed, and reallocating it would have saved the feds tons of money: http://articles.chicagotribune.com... Furthermore, as the World Bank notes, Unions are excellent for economic growth as opposed to non-union countries. http://web.worldbank.org... they also cause more productivity, especially when they have lesser turnover-rates, causing economic activities to increase. Under JFK, unions increased dramatically, and under Coolidge, they plummeted. It is more likely that the money and economic activities as a result of these two consequences (and JFK's heavy investments in tech to land us on the moon) that furthered his economic activities. Re4: Reagan Tax Cuts Indeed Gave a “Sugar High” But When Compared to Clinton's Tax Raise on the Rich, Reagan's Policies Fail in Comparison My opponent completely dropped the fact that Reagan was notorious throughout the 1980's for hiking taxes instead of dropping them. He dropped taxes for the wealthy overall, but hiked taxes several times, and still has the highest single-handed tax hike of all time. Finally, what follows with tax cuts on the wealthy again? Depressions. Again in 1987-88 another depression hit, going into the early 1990's. http://en.wikipedia.org... Compare this to the fact that Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy, and the fact that he led us into the longest economic “boom” in US history, we see that taxes do work, and this is the worst possible case for my opponent to try and defend. http://en.wikipedia.org... Even if we grant that Reagan's policies “took time to work” as my opponent maintains, that 7% surely increased when depressions hit, showing his policies didn't work, along with inflation increasing to 5%. Re5: the “Middle Class” May Have Started Making More Money ....But... The policies I was referring too were the Harding subsidies which would have artificially inflated wages, not Coolidge's. Furthermore,Your argument is that if there is any lower rung people move to a higher rung, then upward mobility is not an issue. But that's not income mobility. Income mobility is the measure of how much your parent's economic status predicts your economic status. The facts actually show that upward mobility in the US is less than other nations. Alan Kruger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers showed that in 1985 when Reagan's policies can be fully felt, his “Great Gatsby Curve” showed that US inequality skyrocketed. It was harder under those tax cuts to increase your income based on your parent's already social-economic status. Why is this important? Because giving a tax cut to a rich man has a minimal impact, he's already made his money, but do the same to a poor man, and we have whole other consequences (the likes of which are being debated by Republicans and Democrats.) http://joewo.com... My opponent falsely claims I dropped his argument that tax cuts harm the economy. I rebuttal-ed with two more contentions, that they help the economically alienated, and are needed for income mobility in the previous rounds via the Gini coefficient, which is good economics. My opponent claims his source advocated for lower taxes. But this is untrue, it just mentioned that Hong Kong uses a 0% income tax rate, but the economist in question advocated for capital gains taxes to be on par with ordinary income, which is what my argument rests on with the Warren Buffet argument, to which he completely dropped. I never dropped his Gilder point either, if economic activity increases it stands to reason more businesses are opening up and people are spending money (which is required for economic activity in the first place) Finally, FDR's policies were removed shortly after WW2, so the long term impacts cannot be measured. One thing we do universally agree upon: it did cause unemployment to drop, with exception to the 1937-38 mini-rescession, which as I had shown was the result of the Treasuries actions, not FDR's. Even if it was bad policy, my opponent cannot deny the Treasuries acts were to blame, not FDR's policies. Re6: (see above gini coefficent argument, a lack of income mobility shows those policies failed the poor, and the result of increasing wages were due to inflation which was 5%.) Re7: One can advocate for more income mobility and not be a socialist. This is an uncalled for ad hominem. I want less income inequality, I stated nothing about heavily redistrubuting funds. My opponent dropped my Warren Buffet arguments, and the arguments of Clinton's policies resulting in better economics as a result of higher taxes. He plagurized, and committed causational fallacies and an ad hominem. He dropped my gini coefficent arguments as well! I have met my BOP, and refuted all of my opponents arguments. Tax increases of the rich to the same as ordinary income ought to be enacted for better economic policies and consequences, and income mobility. My opponent fails to understand correlation is not causation, and that the investments in farming, tech, and unions caused better economics along with higher taxes, not the other way around which caused ""sugar-highs"" and massive crashes.

S554eb968-Ae3c90221	Taxes should be raised on the rich	We have a problem. I ask that the audience consider giving me a conduct point. My opponent actually plagiarized himself, by simply copying and pasting half of his argument from a previous one he made. Thank you. http://www.debate.org... Rebuttals: My opponent submits the Laffer Curve as proof of an “optimizing” tax rate. However, it is far too simplistic, to the point that any economists, much less anyone with a little understanding of the economy would reject this, and because of it's simplicity it cannot account for complex variables in the economy and their impacts. Under the Laffer Curve, my opponent shows that under 0% tax rates, and 100% tax rates government would make no money, either because taxes are too high or too low. This cannot be true, because if we tax at 100% we take away the so-called “profit motive” from the economy. Thus, logically in the economy today, we would find only businesses that seek to make a profit if this were true, but it isn't. Non-profit organizations/volunteers have absolutely NO profit motive, that is, they make 0 dollars, and they have no income taxes to pay as a result. Not only do they do this work essentially for free, but interestingly enough, they help grow the economy! In 2007, Laffer himself said that the curve should not be the sole basis for raising or lowering taxes. My opponent begins to cherry-pick select cases in history for tax cuts, but never seems to tell the whole story. They kept spending the same, paid off debt, implemented heavy farm subsidies to further agriculture production, and furthered free-trade dramatically. Generally speaking economists agree that spending money to reduce debt, and free-trade is desirable, no question about it, but my opponent cannot show that the correlation he espouses is causation in this situation. Also, agriculture employed about 40% of the workforce at the time, and when they subsidize that, it would appear as growth, NOT the tax cuts. Harding also heavily invested in technology, which would be good economically, not tax cuts as well. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] He notes the JFK tax cuts, but the increase in unions (U.S Steel) and the abolishment of the death penalty in the federal government were more likely. The federal government under JFK reallocated all capital punishment sentences to life without parole. This sounds economically insignificant, until you consider the fact that states with CP have the most appeals for their cases than every other state, which on judges payments alone would have saved the feds a huge sum of money, never mind the jury payments, lawyers, etc... And for that matter what about technology? Under JFK we had huge investments in tech, which caused us to launch several projects for space exploration. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Finally, he cites the worst possible example he could cite: the Reagan tax cuts. The Great Communicator increased taxes throughout the 1980's. He actually proved my own point rather than proving his own. In fact, he created several taxes in TEFRA,Social Security, and DEFRA, and TEFRA is the biggest tax hike ever in American history alone, not withstanding the other hikes he made. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Finally, my opponent claims it's necessary for income mobility. But this fundamentally ignores how taxes work (reallocation of resources as generally agreed upon, things like social security for instance) which are designed for income mobility. While Reagan might have had more millionaires in the US at the time, it was because other countries agreed with the US on free-trade agreements. Yet to make up for the lost income at the time, slap on sales and duty taxes to make up for the revenue loss. None-the-less, the Reagan years were not given income mobility due to tax cuts, they were off-set by other countries millionaires coming in, and the income gaps furthered under Reagan dramatically, not the other way around. [http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org...] The same follows for the Harding-Coolidge tax cuts. Income mobility was caused by the farm subsidies they implemented, not by tax cuts. As agriculture was a major industry at the time. In short, I can rebuttal my opponent simply with correlation is not causation. He cannot tell if tax cuts were what caused economic activities, or the programs that interfered with the market were what lead to this. He claims that FDR's policies only worked that way due to WW2, but the problem with this, is simply that war is an economic drain on the economy, thus showing the new deal's success still. Leading up to the war, he ignores the fact that unemployment under FDR's new deal plummeted, while taxes were incredibly high, and production was up along with higher GNP's and GDP's than Hoover's terms. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] My opponent completely dropped the argument about the role in the state in the economy, and why it is justified to interfere in the market place. Meaning now for me to meet my BOP if I find any tax that benefits anyone, I have now filled my BOP. I have; name any social security program you'd like, it's funded by tax dollars and it is beneficial for the fundamental “social floor” below which no one shall fall below. My opponent completely dropped my argument that it is indeed unfair that Warren Buffet pays less taxes than his secretary based on our system today. Finally, my opponent cites Shlaes, which is advocating the exact same thing I am advocating as noted earlier; that Warren Buffet pays less tax as his secretary, and that ought to change. As his own source notes “Sinai says he favours raising taxes on one kind of capital gain, carried interest, to treat it as ordinary income“. - http://www.bloomberg.com... I had noted this in round two at the beginning! C4: Taxes Stimulate the Economy, By Moving Money to the Economically Alienated As economist Robert Reich notes, Clinton had higher tax rates than Reagan, and also had higher rates of economical growth. In fact, Clinton has the record for keeping us in one of the longest economic booms of all time. This is proof that taxes are wonderful for the economy. [http://www.marketplace.org...] C5: If Lower Taxation Rates Actually Worked the US Would Rank Far Higher on the Gini Coefficient. The US holds a rating in the mid 2000's of about 0.48 before taxes and transfers on the Gini Coefficient (which measures income inequality, and economic inequality by countries), after taxes it is 0.37, a decrease meaning the money is far more equitable, and blows a huge hole in my opponents case about income mobility. If you want income mobility, you need to tax. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] The Gini is used to measure income inequality, and in the developed world, the US is one of the worst offenders, while only bringing in a tax rate of about 21% of GDP, the lowest in the developed world. Indeed, tax cuts actually result in poor quality of life, and if they worked like my opponent maintains, they would have the opposite effect, the US would be number 1. But they're not, and by deduction the opposite has to be true. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... Clearly, we need higher taxation rates in the US, and the Rich ought to pay for it. It increases economic activity, prevents inequality, and my opponent's case for the Laffer curve coupled with his examples (which again correlation is not causation), my opponents case is weak, and I have met my BOP, and refuted all his examples.

S9d5a13c2-Aa778921e	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	"Summary My opponents case rest on the notion of correlation being causation. For me to meet by BOP here, I must either show that with a MW hike, jobs either remain the same, or increase, while my opponent must show they will decrease. I have shown that they have correlated with increase, but have other benefits as well. (Such as less paid on welfare, or a de facto stimulus effect as well). The Card and Kreuger Studies Are Sound While my opponent might claim that I based my case on one study, this is false. I noted that the C&K studies not only went state to state, but tested it at the federal level as well, and also with the state of California, they were then verified in 2005 by T.D Stanley, and meta-analysis also shows that my opponents study ignored variables, were designed with publication bias, and failed to show that MW harms jobs. This is not a hasty conclusion, this is an economic reality. Meta-analysis takes all the studies done on MW and tries to show a general trend in those studies, those trends showed a correlation with job increases, or no impact on jobs confirming the soundness of C&K studies. Furthermore, as with the fact that 90% of the world has some form of MW legislation, and the meta-analysis showing overwhelming evidence of error for those studies against MW, showed that again my opponents study was designed to fail (no moving t-score means junk science, as more data you get the t-score MUST change otherwise your ignoring variables). That's great that he cites a study that showed MW costed jobs, but again correlation is not causation, and furthermore as my previous link noted on the meta-analysis states: “Hristos Doucouliagos and T.D. Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on dis-employment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger's initial claim of publication bias is still correct. Moreover, they concluded, ""Once this publication selection is corrected, no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains."" My opponent simply claims this is bogus, and dismisses my evidence asking for more, this is the moving the goal-post fallacy. I provided evidence, and my link was fine. Here it is: http://en.wikipedia.org... I Did Not Make an Ad Populum Fallacy My opponent is factually wrong, I noted that in some places (Latin America, Africa, etc...) MW is simply customary, which is an exception for the Ad Populum fallacy. Furthermore, appeal to popularity is valid only when the questions are whether the belief is widespread and to what degree. I had noted that MW was in over 90% of the world, that was it. Therefore, this does not qualify for the Ad populum fallacy, as it's impacts are debated, however, factually it is used internationally, and thus ample data exists. http://en.wikipedia.org... McDonald's Has Been Around Since the 1940's And Has Seen MW Increase. Their Tech Went the Opposite Way My opponent continues to claim that automation would steal jobs, but this does not make sense for several reasons as I noted earlier: 1) McDonalds has gone the opposite way, from a self-serve resturaunt to a more “factory” like one (as noted in their history) and 2) They've been around for years and seen MW hike about 15 times, yet they still have not completely automated like my opponent claims. What makes now so different? Even then, technology innovation is excellent for the economy, and as I pointed out earlier is a case for MW increases, not against it! (Due to time constraints, this is the last of my argument) Thank you Roy, I accepted this to assist me in an essay for Minimum wage Legislation! I'm happy we had this debate and hope to battle it out again another time!"	CON	119
S38f1c3c6-A7de95771	Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction.	"This is a Lincoln Douglass topic, but since my opponent will not be arguing in the typical LD format, neither will I. Definitions and Observations Developing Country- a poor agricultural country that is seeking to become more advanced economically and socially (New Oxford American Dictionary) Developing Country- countries with a GNI of US $11,905 and less are defined as developing (World Bank 2012) I used two definitions. The first one describes what a developing country is aiming to do, and the second one explains what results in a developing country technically being considered ""developing."" Environmental Protection- environmental guardianship based on policies and procedures (Black’s Law Dictionary) 1. the conserving of natural resources 2. the preserving of the existing natural environment 3. where possible, repairing damage and reversing trends Resource Extraction- the action of taking out a country’s collective means of supporting itself of becoming wealthier, as represented by its reserves of minerals, land, and other assets esp. using effort of force (New Oxford American Dictionary) Conflict- A serious disagreement or argument, typically a protracted one 1. This debate is over only instances where environmental protection is in direct conflict with resource extraction. All the examples I provide are instances where resource extraction has substantially hindered environmental protection. 2. My opponent cannot argue for holding both environmental protection and resource extraction equally since this debate is only over instances where the two cannot coexist. Arguments Points 1 and 2 talk about how protecting the environment helps citizens of developing countries (as well as citizens outside developing countries) because environmental degradation in one country can obviously affect countries around it. Points 3, 4, and 5 talk about how protecting the environment will ultimately help the nation develop both economically and socially. 1. Developing countries have unstable environments due to resource extraction. Unclean water is responsible for approximately 3.1% of all deaths worldwide. 99% of these deaths are in developing countries (1). Highly toxic chemicals are used to separate metals from the ore, and at the end of operation, the resulting waste may threaten to poison the nearby soil, waterways, and wildlife (2).” So essentially, mining can result in unclean water. Farming (which fits my definition of resource extraction) can contribute to this problem if done incorrectly. The over fertilization of plants can result in unusable groundwater in poor countries (3). Another major issue is outdoor air pollution which results in around 800,000 deaths each year. “Resource extraction and processing industries, which are common in developing countries, emit dust or hazardous fumes at the worksite (4).” One billion people, worldwide, rely on forest based assets to live. This is about 1/7 of our population. Even though taking good care of our ecosystems is important, 15 out of the 24 essential services from ecosystems are currently being eroded (1). Look at this chart: Here we can see that security, basic materials, and health benefits come from ecosystem services. Excessive resource extraction interferes with all these things. 2. Ensuring environmental stability through the prioritization of environmental protection over resource extraction will benefit developing countries. Achieving environmental stability has had many benefits for developing countries, as shown in the case of Albania. In 2005, Albania began to prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction due to all the damages done by excessive deforestation. According to the Global Environment Facility, when Albania prioritized environmental protection, within three years (by 2008), a large governmental staff in charge of forest extension was developed, natural forest habitats and scrub forest coverage were improved and increased, and 400,000 tons of erosion had been reduced, enabling citizens to farm. The country also began to work on stricter law enforcement (5). Another example would be Nepal. In 2001, Nepal began the process of reforestation. The forest coverage increased by 1.35 percent from 2001 to 2005. This may seem like a small amount, but there were a large amount of benefits. UNEP states, ""The remarkable turnaround in forest management in Nepal is directly attributable to the benefits generated for community groups, in the form of environmental goods, services, and welfare enhancements (6)."" 3. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) are best achieved through environmental protection. I will be as brief as possible with this point, but I aim to explain that the MDG’s are best achieved through environmental protection. I only covered the goals that I feel have direct environmental linkages (1). 1. Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. I’d like to go back to my point on the destruction of ecosystems. 15 out of the 24 essential services for life are being eroded. Also, impoverished individuals in developing countries often have to look to farming in order to obtain food. In cases such as Lesotho, resource extraction has rendered only 10 percent of their soil usable (7). 2. Reduce child mortality: Most of the people who die from water diseases are under the age of five. Reference my point about water pollution above. 3. Combat diseases: My OECD card notes that U33; of all diseases in developing countries is associated with environmental risk factors. Protecting the environment helps prevent such diseases. Obviously, prevention is more effective than treatment when it comes to combating diseases. 4. Ensure environmental sustainability: 1 billion people currently rely on forest based assets to live. “Current trends in environmental degradation that are caused by resource extraction must be reversed to sustain the health and productivity of the world’s ecosystems.” 4. Economic development is achieved by the prioritization environmental protection. According to the International Journal for Rural Development, 4-12% of Africa’s GDP is lost due to environmental degradation (8). OECD states that environmental wealth counts for 25% of the total wealth within low-income countries (1). If developing countries prioritize environmental protection they will increase their environmental wealth and obtain a higher GDP. So, in the end, money spent on environmental degradation will go towards achieving development while keeping the environment stable. 5. Economic development is hindered by the prioritization of resource extraction The resource curse takes place when countries begin to extract a large amount of nonrenewable resources. The resource curse, defined by the Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics from Ohio State University, says the natural resource curse refers to the paradox that countries and regions with an abundance of natural resources, like minerals and fuels, tend to have less economic growth and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources (9). Developing countries with low amounts of economic growth are often the ones with an abundance of natural resources. In addition to this, an article from The Atlantic emphasizes that the money provided from resource extraction goes only to the elite of society, and poverty is in no way being decreased (10). A study from MIT tech notes that in developing countries, corruption is much more prevalent, thus the resource curse and misuse of money from resources is a very large of problem (11).

Scde43845-A98809042	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Many thanks to Roy for proposing we debate this ""controversial"" topic, it has been a pleasure. In closing, I will offer a brief summary of the debate, followed by some responses to Pro's claims in the final round. Pro's case At this point, I assume drops are concessions. Pro concedes the following points: 1. Results showing the U.S. economy would be at least 13% larger without trade deficits 2. The problem of externalities, including pollution and technological spillover (See R2) 3. Evidence that free trade leads to human rights violations 4. Evidence that free trade has been a catalyst for war/violence (by desire to impose free trade on other nations) 5. Free trade is a win-lose policy (Pro admits to ""free trade producing winners and losers"") 6. The general populace favors trade restrictions 7. Free trade increases income inequality and thus poverty 8. Factors of production do not move easily between industries 9. The whole economy is at risk when investments in human capital are negated by free trade 10. Short-term consumption at expense of long-term prosperity Recall Pro accepts the BoP. What, then, is left of Pro's argument that could possibly outweigh the negative effects of free trade and thus satisfy the BoP? According to Pro: 11. Comparative advantage is sound (after Pro's concessions, is this not free-trade fundamentalism?) 12. Lower prices from competition 13. Historical record supports free trade Each of these is dubious. At the outset, it is already questionable whether (11) and (12) outweigh the negative economic effects, lost jobs, income inequality, trade deficits, etc. Any time an economic change creates both winners and losers, as Pro admits free trade does, the judgment of whether the change is good or bad for the group as a whole is problematic. It becomes a matter of moral philosophy, not number crunching. Economists, as a result of their training, have no more claim to know what is good for the country than any other citizen. Pro's outdated surveys (from 2006) of economists won't help us here. Free trade makes a minority of the country better off, but hurts the majority. Even if the total gains to the few winners are sufficiently large (they aren't) that they could hypothetically compensate the losers, why would it be obvious that Americans as a group are net winners? In R2, I stated: ""no theorem in economics guarantees the gains of consumers outweighs the loss of workers."" Pro never contests this statement, Pro does not even provide evidence that savings from lower prices outweigh the economic and human loss from lost jobs and lower wages. Hence, Pro has not met the BoP. By way of response, in R2 and R3, I also challenged (11) and (12) with the counterargument that comparative advantage depends on the assumption that factors of production move easily between industries. Pro argued in R3 that the resources employed in one industry will be employed in a more competitive industry with higher returns. I argued that the reality is different. The economic investment in human capital (the skills workers pay money to acquire) is totally lost. Physical resources of production (for example, blast furnaces in a bankrupt steel mill) are also lost. As a result, you see physics PhDs as taxi-drivers. Pro dropped these arguments, effectively conceding that comparative advantage is false. Yet Pro continues to support (without any counterargument) the theory of comparative advantage. Pro writes, ""The theory of comparative advantage is so well established that it isn't necessary to refute each and every type of trade restriction."" Considering the large number of esteemed economists that question comparative advantage (most famously, Dani Rodrik), Pro's statement is clearly false. If a pragmatic trade restriction is discovered that solves all the problems with free trade without posing new problems, it would be necessary even for the free-trade fundamentalist to refute it if free trade were to continue. Pro argues import competition leads to lower prices on imports. Pro fails to realize that imports are fundamentally paid for by exports, the price of which must rise to generate the increased sales. Higher prices on domestic goods are certainly bad for domestic consumers who spend a greater proportion of their income on domestic products, such as drugs and food. Against the hard economic facts, Pro insists prices for domestic products will not go up. How does Pro propose we pay for increasing value of imports? Pro offers no answer. The only answer is deficit trading. When we import a greater value of goods than we export, it produces a trade deficit. Pro admits deficit trading is bad for the economy overall. Pro ignores the double bind here, and instead continues to claim (by ignoring my arguments) that lowered prices from imports are worth the cost of lost jobs, trade deficits, higher prices on domestic goods, and dramatically increased inequality. But Pro has not proven that competitively priced imports are worth the human, moral, and economic costs. Brief responses to the rest of R4 The evidence: Japan is blatantly protectionist. In Chile human rights violations were required to keep domestic demand high and free trade going. Both China and India keep their manufacturing tariffs above 30% (protections). Hong Kong does not count, it was British (not an independent state). In protectionist Latin America, per capita income in the 60s and 70s was growing at 3.1% per year. After the continent embraced free trade in the 80s, per capita income dropped to 1.7%. [11] Likewise, in Africa living standards fell dramatically after free trade policies were introduced. The evidence favors trade restrictions. Pro claims he did not say anything about savings, but half his argument is about savings. Savings from lowered prices. Government overspending. In economic theory, both of these are known as savings problems. For example, Pro states, ""the Federal government pays interest on the debt it has accumulated from overspending."" In R3, I explained why overspending (savings rates) and trade deficits are the same thing. Pro drops my argument, and claims no argument about savings was made, even though Pro explicitly refers to ""overspending"" throughout the debate. Pro dismisses Buffet's plan by stating that particularities of protections are irrelevant. I disagree. As stated earlier, if a particular protection is economically sound, it should not be dismissed without consideration. According to Warren Buffet, the trade deficit is the most urgent economic problem our nation faces. His solution: ""We would achieve this balance by issuing what I will call Import Certificates (ICs) to all U.S. exporters in an amount equal to the dollar value of their exports. Each exporter would, in turn, sell the ICs to parties--either exporters abroad or importers here--wanting to get goods into the U.S. To import $1 million of goods, for example, an importer would need ICs that were the byproduct of $1 million of exports. The inevitable result: trade balance."" [12] Trade is balanced through free-market forces. If Exxon had nothing to export, it would acquire ICs from other exporters, allowing Exxon to legally import oil. Exxon itself has no need to export anything, but to keep the quantity of other exports in mind so that trade is ultimately balanced. Pro misunderstands Buffet's plan. Buffet's plan solves a great deal of problems with free trade (deficit trading) while retaining everything Pro argues is beneficial: competition and free-market economics. Hence, Pro practically concedes the debate by dismissing Buffet's plan in R3 and R4. It is a relatively simple solution to the problems of free trade that merits serious consideration. It is a better trade policy than free trade. As my summary has shown, Pro has not met the BoP. The resolution is negated. [11] http://tinyurl.com... [12] http://tinyurl.com..."	CON	122

S22d02825-A36c8976a	The 2010 Health Care Reform Should be Repealed	"REBUTTAL 2 a. A Case for the Reliability of the CBO It it is a apparent that the majority of Con's arguments are centered around the discrediting of the CBO. I'd like to set the record straight on that. In 1999 the CBO launched an internal investigation to review how it's forecasts have matched up with reality. The results show that since 1976 they have never been off by more than 6% and is usually never off by more than 2% [1]. Secondly, the CBO's prediction on the health care reform legislation is backed up by other non-partisan sources. Including, but not limited to, The Joint Committee on Taxation [2,3] and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [4]. Pro's source used for his claims against the CBO is a single person, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, someone who works close with Republican politicians [5]. I'd like to see where Holtz-Eakin pulls out the idea that the Medicare savings are unrealistic. By what standard? The laws are in the legislation to save the money. Why exactly won't they work? You have the burden of proof here. I'll be dropping the arguments on government run healthcare since they are irrelevant to the subject of this debate. I would be happy to debate Pro on it in another debate if he wishes. ARGUMENTS Even though it is unnecessary for my burden in this debate, I like to be thorough. Here are some arguments of my own. a. Beneficial for Small Businesses According to the Council of Economic Advisers [6]: ""The U.S. health care system imposes a heavy ""tax"" on small businesses and their employees. Due to high broker fees, fixed administrative costs, and adverse selection, small businesses pay up to 18 percent more per worker than large firms for the same health insurance policy. Some of these higher costs are passed on to small firm employees in the form of lower wages, and some eat into the profits of small businesses that could otherwise be used for research and development and for much-needed investments. This implicit tax disadvantages small firms in both the market for the best workers and the market for their products. Because of their higher health care costs, small businesses are far less likely to provide health insurance for their workers than larger businesses. Only 49 percent of firms with 3 to 9 workers and 78 percent of firms with 10 to 24 workers offered any type of health insurance to their employees in 2008. In contrast, 99 percent of firms with more than 200 workers offered health insurance. Consistent with this pattern, 29 percent of non-elderly adult workers at firms with fewer than 25 employees were uninsured in 2007. In that same year, just 10 percent of workers in firms with 500 or more employees were uninsured. Workers at small firms that do offer health insurance also tend to have less generous plans than workers at large firms. The fraction of small firms offering health insurance has been declining in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the fraction of firms with 3 to 9 employees offering health insurance to their workers declined from 58 to 49 percent."" and ""Small businesses that meet certain criteria would be able to purchase health insurance through an ""insurance exchange"" – allowing them to choose among a multitude of plans that would provide better coverage at lower costs than they could find in the current small group market. Many small businesses that provide health insurance for their employees would receive a small business tax credit to alleviate their disproportionately higher costs and encourage coverage. The tax credit would be targeted to those firms with employees whose average wages fall below a certain threshold. The current reform options include financial incentives for medium- and large-sized firms to provide health insurance coverage through so-called ""pay-or-play"" provisions. Firms with payrolls or employment levels below a certain threshold, which would include the vast majority of small businesses, would be exempt from the pay-or-play provisions. The creation of an insurance exchange would also provide better and lower-cost options for workers in small businesses that do not offer health insurance. Low-income individuals and families would receive sliding scale subsidies to help them purchase insurance. Additionally, health insurers would not be allowed to screen potential enrollees for pre-existing conditions. The proposed reforms could help spur entrepreneurial activity by increasing the incentives for talented Americans to launch their own companies, and could increase the pool of workers willing to work at small firms. Further, successful reform would reduce the phenomenon of ""job lock,"" in which workers are reluctant to leave a job with employer-sponsored health insurance out of fear that they will not be able to find affordable coverage. Small firms that are unable to provide health insurance for their employees bear the greatest cost of this phenomenon. Reductions in absenteeism and improvements in worker productivity resulting from better health outcomes because of expanded coverage would particularly benefit small businesses."" b. Lives Will Be Saved The primary goal of the legislation is to insure as many people as possible. Studies show that about 45,000 people die every year in the United States due to being uninsured [7]. So, let us assume for a second that Pro is correct about the economics of the plan. We still must ask ourselves what price we would put on a human life, or thousands of them. It is a hard task to set such a price and argue for it's justifiably. c. The Patient's Bill of Rights The health care includes a measure known as the patient's bill of rights, something which will greatly increase patient satisfaction. Some rights that it establishes are[8]: .Stop insurance companies from limiting the care you need. .Remove insurance company barriers between you and your doctor. .Reviewing Insurers’ Premium Increases. .Getting the Most from Your Premium Dollars. .Keeping Young Adults Covered. .Providing Affordable Coverage to Americans without Insurance due to Pre-existing Conditions For an explanation of all these please visit the source.

S9d5a13c2-A97b010	The minimum wage should not be raised to $15/hr for fast food workers	"Re1: Labour Costs is Indeed 25-30% However, Pro Commits a Straw man Here Con claims I didn't contest his assertion that labour costs are 25-30%. I agree, I did not. Because objectively it is true, but what I did refute what that labour costs would increase as a result of an increase in MW. And if we have two similar companies (such as Walmart and Costco) and compare the two, we see that Costco saves a substantial amount of money due to a lack of turnover caused by paying more for labour. “Turnover is unusually low, at 17% overall and just 6% after one year’s employment. In contrast, turnover at Wal-Mart is 44% a year, close to the industry average...let’s assume that the total cost of replacing an hourly employee at Costco or Sam’s Club is only 60% of his or her annual salary. If a Costco employee quits, the cost of replacing him or her is therefore $21,216. If a Sam’s Club employee leaves, the cost is $12,617. At first glance, it may seem that the low-wage approach at Sam’s Club would result in lower turnover costs...total annual cost to Costco of employee churn is $244 million, whereas the total annual cost to Sam’s Club is $612 million” Thus, when MW increases, we notice turnover dropping and costs saved. Which means in the short run it might be more expensive, however in the long run these firms do save money as a result, which means MW decreases labour costs, not increase them. That was my whole point, to which my opponent obviously missed. [http://hbr.org...] The committee lead by Warren noted only an 8 cent increase was supported by the Card and Kruger studies which noted prices did increase but only cents at a time (about 5). Both the study and the increase we're debating about increased wages about 18% found the same numbers. They have been consistent even with my opponents own numbers (20% is reasonable as he stated) so claiming it's more like $1.25 is outrageous and unsupported. That's only if his math is correct, but it again does not account for all variables (such as staff workers buying into McDonald’s themselves when they have more disposable income due to MW increases) I agree prices will rise, I disagree with how much they will rise. [http://davidcard.berkeley.edu...] Re2: MW Increases Do Not Eliminate Jobs No error in his source because the model in which he examines MW call for what we would generally predict in the economy, which again is not what we precisely see. This is only using the supply and demand model, which generalizes the economy, it does not precisely predict what happens. Just because there is no error in his source does not mean the methodology isn't flawed, and indeed as I showed it was made to find that MW would cost jobs. When we drop this model and go strictly on the basis of observation, we find this is simply untrue. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] In fact, my opponent cites the Newmark papers, which are heavily flawed. Originally, my opponents study actually agreed with the results of Card and Kruger before contradicting them. Card and Krugers (C&K) later studies were not only verified by T.D Stanley in 2005, but Meta-analysis of MW studies also verify C&K's studies as showing more employment increases with studies on increases of MW, and that the studies my opponent cite had heavy publication bias, and failed to meet the statistical reliability needed to justify their model and results (to be reliable studies have to have a 0.05 rating in the T-stat, opponents of MW had a score of 2, meaning they're junk science). [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Finally, one thing my opponent completely dropped was that when MW increases, more people will look for a job. Let's not forget to be considered unemployed you must meet the following conditions: 1) you must be actively looking for a job and 2) you must not have a job. So someone like a stay-at-home mother is not considered “unemployed” because she is not actively looking. Whereas someone fired and looking for work is considered. So, if labour force participation increases with increases in MW, then it's entirely possible under my opponents model to show increases of unemployed, yet MW increases still create more jobs; it's just that more people are encouraged to actively look for a job as a result, which is why his studies using supply and demand do not work, they cannot tell if it's more people entering the labour force or if firms are no longer hiring. [http://www.oecd.org...] Finally, my opponent claims that MW increase cannot stimulate the economy, this is nonsense, the poorest people in this country spend their money the most, if they have more disposable income and continue to spend they way they do, then increases of MW will in fact act like a stimulus for the economy. [http://www.ksl.com...] And no McDonald's will not automate everything even though MW increases because in the short run, those investments in tech are too costly, whereas people have the distinct advantage of having more skill in more than one area of work (promotions for example, or cooking more than one good, etc...) Besides, McDonald's when they were first founded were already automated to a certain degree, if MW increases have already happened and automation hasn't taken over completely, then this is an absurd argument by appealing to fear. They've been around since the 1940's and have seen numerous MW hikes, and yet they went from a self-serving type fast-food chain to an “assembly line” as my source notes. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Finally, my opponent states “no one knows more about the McDonald's trade offs than McDonald's” which is true, but we have to look at this policy from the economy as a whole and evaluate it, we're not debating if it ought to be implemented, thus we have to go by economists, and the C&K studies, not McDonald's, last time I checked, they're not experts on Macroeconomics, economists are. Also, I cited the Costco vs Walmart for a “controlled experiment” on the impacts of wage hikes. Which is why Roy doesn't want that to be considered; it shows without question the superiority of MW increases. Re3: MW is NOT Welfare My opponent concedes that MW is here to stay for at least some positive reason, he just doesn't want it to get “worse”, besides I already showed through MPL in a monopsonistic competition that wages are below, thus my opponent concedes here. My opponent then goes on to say we have to talk about advantages versus disadvantages, which is true, but it's been around since the 1800's internationally, and is still in 90% of the world. If we want to weight in the +/- consequences of this policy, then to empirically test it's soundness we must see what it's impacts are, and assume the government is involved with MW and violating the right to contract, otherwise his whole case around the empirical of MW losing jobs has to be tossed out as irrelevant, because he simply has no data to show, and concedes that his model is a bunch of generalities, not preciseness. The Gini coefficient is important, when inequality is reduced, crime decrease, social cohesion improves, quality of life improves, and economic incentives develop, all this by increasing MW, to which my opponent didn't contest and just claimed “it's a measure” yet the two are correlated, and show the ""spin-off"" effect of increases. [http://en.wikipedia.org...] Drops: My opponent drops that MW has been around for years due to it's effectiveness, and it has been internationally accepted in other parts of the world. In fact, some parts it's socially employed not legally My opponent drops my monopsonistic argument favouring businesses unfairly My opponent drops that MW may cause tech improvements, and his contradicting claims in RD2(prices) Thank You"	CON	140

Scde43845-Ad967cc	The United States should have a general policy of free trade.	"Free trade is riddled with huge problems, most of which are generally acknowledged even by free traders. As Paul Krugman, winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics, writes: ""it's hard to avoid the conclusion that growing U.S. trade with third world countries reduces the real wages of many and perhaps most workers in this country. And that reality makes the politics of trade very difficult."" [1] I argue that free trade is not overall beneficial, and that its problems can be solved with pragmatic restrictions. Comparative advantage Free trade is fundamentally predicated on the false theory of comparative advantage: it is beneficial for the US to import some goods (including services) in order to free up our workforce to produce more-valuable goods instead. The logic seems intuitive, which explains its support by many. But I assure readers, there is a growing consensus among economists that comparative advantage and free trade is deeply flawed. I will attempt to explain why. Sustainability A free trade policy falsely assumes that trade is sustainable. When the US buys goods from foreigners, it must give them something in return. There are only three things we can give in return: goods we produce today, yesterday, or tomorrow. When we end up using the 2nd and 3rd option, goods we produced yesterday and tomorrow, we produce a trade deficit. Even Pro admits free trade causes the trade deficit. See Pro’s [3] and [4]. As a result, foreigners now own 50% of all publicly traded Treasury securities, 25% of American corporate bonds, and roughly 12% of American corporate stock. Net foreign ownership of American assets is $3.5 trillion. The Economic Strategy Institute estimated in 2001 that the trade deficit was shaving at least one percent per year off our economic growth. Following in their footsteps, economist William Bahr has estimated that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [2] That’s a hole in our economy bigger than the entire economy of Canada. Other economists have reached similar conclusions. 6.5% of our federal budget goes to interest on this debt. According to the World Bank, if free trade continues, “the U.S. net international investment position – which compares the value of foreign-owned U.S. assets with the value of U.S.-owned foreign assets – will hit a staggering minus-69 percent of annual gross domestic product by 2025.” [3] In plain English, free trade is unsustainable. Deficit trade also destroys jobs right now. It is estimated that every billion dollars of trade deficit costs Americans 9000 jobs. For example, the trade deficit with China from 2001 to 2008 cost the US 2.8 million jobs. [4] Keep in mind that, because Americans consume more than they produce, the debt will have to be paid for in the future. Foreigners already gave us their goods, which we bought on credit; they won’t owe us anything later. In the future we will be required, in effect, to work without being paid. The trade deficit occurs because free trade makes no distinction between short-term or long-term efficiency. It treats short-term and long-term as completely arbitrary factors. Hence, free trade maximizes short-term living standard, but it comes at the expense of long-term prosperity. Again, free trade is simply unsustainable. The flip side of financial debt from imports is unsustainable exports. The U.S. exports a significant quantity of nonrenewable resources. Depleting nonrenewable resources, along with pollution and environmental damage, are factors that free trade completely ignores. This makes completely unregulated exports unsustainable as well. We conclude that free trade is unsustainable. This is a serious problem that is easily fixable. We achieve financial sustainability by controlling trade and fixing the exchange rate. The solution to unsustainable exports is to tax or otherwise restrict trade that depletes nonrenewable resources or emits pollution. Externalities An externality is the economic term for when a product’s price does not reflect its true economic value. A classic negative externality is environmental damage, which reduces the economic value of natural resources without raising the price of the product that harmed them. The classic positive externality is technological spillover, where one company’s inventing a product enables others to copy or build it, generating wealth that the original company does not capture. Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, it will recommend bad policies. China’s economy, for example, has grown less than it seems when one takes into account the massive pollution and destruction of its soil and air. Free trade not only permits pollution but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage. The issue of externalities is a well-known problem, even to honest free traders. The solution is to end free trade, tax imports produced in a harmful way, and subsidize research and development of new technologies. Lower Prices? This is where we really see the problem of comparative advantage. Anyone who understands comparative advantage knows that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level. When a country opens to free trade, it is the relative price of imports that comes down; by necessity, the relative prices of its exports must go up. Pro's examples of lowered prices (like the Wal-Mart effect) have to be qualified to take into account the fact that the relative price of the goods the U.S. exports is higher than it would have been absent free trade. This means the prices of domestic goods will go up! Stolper-Samuelson Theorem and Income Inequality The Stolper-Samuelson theorem [5] is the underlying mechanism of free-market economics. It says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant factor of production and lowers returns to the scarce one. In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Free trade thus hurts American workers. The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily tradeable and can be produced through cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who will either lose their job or be paid less. So while free trade may expand our economy overall, it destroys a huge number of American jobs as well as increasing the wage gap between blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Keep in mind, the majority of US workers are blue-collar workers. In the US, free trade literally redistributes wealth by making the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is unfair. In fact, in 2006 it was estimated that freer trade cost the average household earning the median income more than $2000. [6] For many households, that is more than their entire federal tax bill! Anyone against higher taxes and big government should bear that in mind when evaluating free trade. An Alternative to Free Trade I particularly like one proposed by Warren Buffet: the idea that exporters be given $1 certificates for every dollar of their exports, and that importers would then have to buy a certificate from them for every dollar of goods they imported. This would, of course, force America's trade into balance immediately, solving a major problem with free trade. Concluding Remarks Free trade creates win-lose situations. When imports replace goods produced in the US, consumers enjoy lower prices on impored goods -- but workers don't like the lost jobs. Given that consumers and workers are ultimately the same people, this means they lose more as workers than they gain as consumers. There is no theorem in economics that guarantees the gains of consumers outweighs the loss of workers. There are fatal flaws to free trade that are fixable. Many more problems exist that, because of space limitations, I will try to cover in future Rounds. [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...

The Fair Tax is a consumption tax at the point of sale for 23% of every dollar spent. It's effectively a 30% sales tax. For the first year. 2. The tax will replace income tax, social security, corporate taxes, capital gains tax, Medicare tax, payroll tax, gift taxes and estate tax. 3. The tax would be on all new goods and services. Purchases from thrift shops, used book stores, used car dealers etc. wouldn't be taxed. Things owned before the fair tax took effect would not be taxed. 4. After the first year the tax rate would be adjusted automatically using a formula that uses the previous fiscal year's federal receipts. 5. A tax rebate will be sent out monthly for the amount a family of that size would spend at the poverty level. This tax rebate is referred to as a prebate.
