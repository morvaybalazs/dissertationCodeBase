S826727db-A162dcb36	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"In this round, I will state my arguments. First off, Felons already have voting rights when they get out of prison. For example, in California [1] California – Voting rights are restored after parole is completed and no longer incarcerated. Anyways, I will argue why Felons shouldn't have the right to vote. Contention 1; Dishonesty and Poor Character. [2] ""We don't let children vote, for instance, or noncitizens, or the mentally incompetent. Why? Because we don't trust them and their judgment... So the question is, do criminals belong in that category? And I think the answer is clearly yes. People who commit serious crimes have shown that they are not trustworthy."" People who are felons have committed crimes and have taken other rights of people. Such as committing murder and taking away an innocent life. As my opponent has stated above ""“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” When a felon takes can take a life, and the happiness of that person, and the happiness of that family. What gives that felon to have rights that every American bestows? ""Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. When someone commits a felon, they should have some rights taken away. Voting privileges should be taken away as well. [3] "" Children, non-citizens and the mentally incompetent can't vote because of standards involving trustworthiness and responsibility. The same requirements should apply to felons"" Contention 2; [2] Congressional Authority over Voting ""Most prominently, the 14th Amendment makes felon voting a state prerogative, not a federal one..."" According to section 2 of the 14th Amendment, it's okay to take away a felons right to vote [4] ""Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants states the authority to deny voting rights to anyone with a criminal conviction, and it is up to the states to determine their own restoration process if they choose to enact one."" The 1st Amendment doesn't state ""Every U.S citizen no matter what the background, has the right to vote."" The 1st Amendment doesn't give that right to everybody, instead they give the states the choice. This is to show, Felons don't have the right to vote, it's not a right. By the 14th Amendment, Felons don't have the right to vote depending on the States choice. This Amendment clearly shows, it's not taking away a right. What should happen. [5] "" Your July 16 editorial “Disenfranchised Felons” asserts that the only reason not to let felons vote is “to stigmatize them or to continue punishing them.” To the contrary, the fundamental reason we do not let felons vote is that we have certain minimum, objective standards of responsibility, trustworthiness and loyalty to our laws that must be met before someone can participate in the sacred enterprise of self-government. So we don’t let children vote or the mentally incompetent or noncitizens — or those who have committed serious crimes against other people. The right to vote can be restored to felons, but it should be done carefully and case by case, to ensure that the person has really turned over a new leaf. To put it another way: If you are not willing to follow the law, you cannot demand the right to elect those who make the law."" Felons should be able to vote once they have turned over a new leaf and have shown over a span of time that they are capable to vote in a trustworthy matter. They need to have consequences, if they don't, what have they learned? Sources: [1] https://exoffenders.net... [2] http://felonvoting.procon.org... [3] http://www.newsmax.com...

S826727db-A79a54ba4	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"Rebuttals: Con states that “First off, Felons already have voting rights when they get out of prison.” I noted this in round one. There are some cases where voting rights are restored after the sentence is served, but not always. This is also off-point as I am arguing that felons should not have to regain their right, I am asserting they should retain/ never have lost the right to vote. Contention 1; Dishonesty and Poor Character. Con states ""We don't let children vote, for instance, or noncitizens, or the mentally incompetent. Why? Because we don't trust them and their judgment... “ We don’t let children vote, it’s true. I disagree that it is due to us not trusting their judgement. Rather it is their inability to reason. This is due to the Pre-frontal cortex of the brain not being fully developed. (1)(2) Non-citizens don’t vote it is true, not because we don’t trust them, but rather because voting is part of the social contract of which non-citizens are not a part of. Con than asks “do criminals belong in that category?” I am assuming the category being children, noncitizens, or mentally incompetent. Clearly felons should not. Felons are not children, are citizens, and if mentally incompetent would have made the insanity plea. Thus Felons do not fit in this category. We see contention one is negated. Contention 2; Congressional Authority over Voting Much of this contention merely states the status quo, not support for it. I have shown in my argument why the status ought to be changed. Merely stating the status quo does not negate or support Con’s Argument. Con argues that “the fundamental reason we do not let felons vote is that we have certain minimum, objective standards of responsibility, trustworthiness and loyalty to our laws that must be met before someone can participate in the sacred enterprise of self-government.” This is in contrast to America’s fundamental principles of Government. “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed” Con has added a multitude of criteria to vote that is un-necessary. The only legitimate government gets its consent from the governed. If felons can’t vote, they can’t give consent. Thus, making the government that takes away the right to vote illegitimate. We ought not have an illegitimate government. Thus Felons should retain the right to vote. Overview: Con has argued against the resolution essentially as follows…. 1: Felons fit into a category with the mentally underdeveloped, handicapped, or non-citizens and thus should not have voting rights. 2: Felons under the status quo do not have the right to vote and thus should not have the right to vote. 3: To have voting rights you must meet the specific criteria she lists. Number one is entirely untrue and dismissed. Number two is just a statement of the status quo not support for it. Number 3 is arbitrary and thus not strong support to negate.

S8fdf3c42-Af142dbb	In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"NEGATIVE I negate: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote For the sake of clarity, I would like to define some key terms: (1) Democracy: a government by the people in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by their elected officials (2) Felon: a person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year I offer the following observations of the resolution: (1) Because America is a democracy, a society, and should not allow felons the privilege of voting, the United States complies with all restrictions in the resolution, thus implied by the resolution (2) The resolution clearly states ""felons"" versus ""ex-felons"". The United Nations defines an ex-felon as somebody who has completed their sentence, and a felon, as stated in the resolution, as somebody currently serving their sentence. Therefore, my opponent must prove how letting felons vote in prison is upholding a just democracy Value: Justice Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness The Negative values justice. Justice is implied by the resolution because it deals with the punishment of felons. In order for a society to be democratic, all punishment must be fair and just. If punishment is not fair and just, a democracy cannot prosper. In this debate, I will show why this punishment is perfectly just. I will show my value of justice through the maximization of fairness. Democracy is a majority rule. Currently, the United States is comprised of over 98% of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens, versus the less than 2% of society that are murders and rapists. 98 to 2, who should get the rights? To prove my point, I make the following arguments (1) Retribution. Retribution is giving punishment that is deserved, or punishment that fits the crime. When somebody commits a felony, say rape, they treat their victim as a moral non-entity. An entity is a human being, so treating somebody as a non-entity is treating somebody less than human. So, the government has an obligation to punish this criminal. Does the government then in turn rape the felon? Of course not. This would be treating the felon as a moral non-entity, just as he did to his victim. This is cruel and unusual punishment that would make the government no better than the felon. But, the government still has to punish the felon. What is the government to do? The government must treat the felon as a political non-entity, in order to punish the criminal, yet not be cruel and unusual. Treating a felon as a political non-entity includes revoking the privilege of voting. 2) Legal Consistency. When felons are incarcerated, they are essentially removed from society – both for the punishment of the criminal and for the safety of the rest of society. In their removal from society, they lose certain rights that they would normally possess; they lose their social rights and the freedom of activity, occupational rights and the freedom to engage in the workforce, parental rights and the freedom to raise children, etc. Why, then, should criminals be allowed to maintain their political rights and the freedom to vote? There are many rights which are more basic taken away from the individual during his imprisonment; if we are to uphold some level of legal consistence and be uniform and fair in the level of punishment afforded to prisoners, then there is no reason why we should afford felons the privilege of voting and every reason not to. 3) Double Standard. By affirming the resolution, you are essentially condoning violent acts, which, as a democratic society, we are morally obliged not to do. By affirming the resolution, you are giving felons superior rights. You are not only treating felons as equal, but you are giving them rights that make them superior to normal, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens. You make the law-breakers into the law-makers. By affirming the resolution, you are saying that people who brake the law in the most brazen way, by committing a felony, would be better than a law-abiding citizen because they broke the law and still have the same amount of rights. As you can see, this is simply wrong. Thank you, and it is for those reasons that I negate the resolution"	CON	6
S7da97fb8-Abb8960bc	R: Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"Look forward to a great confrontation in round 3! BOP Now, my opponent's case is that felons should be able to vote; logically, this means we should restore voting rights for all felons, and that future felons would not be penalized by removing their right. My opponent bears sole BOP, which means he is responsible to prove that felons should be able to vote. If he fails to do so, or I demonstrate any situation where a felon should not be allowed to vote, I would win. Contention 1 - Government is just, and its powers derive from society Thomas Jefferson says it best in the Declaration of Independence, ""All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"". The idea of God-given rights form the cornernstone of American justice and a key part of traditional American values. Jefferson continues: "" That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"". That is, government exists to protect rights. Its powers, when derived from and held by the people, are just. This includes, by nature, the power to punish those who violate rights. Contention 2 - Punishment consists of revoking of rights What does punishment entail? In general, the idea in common law is that punishment should fit the crime - that is, the more severe the crime, the more severe the punishment. The most common methods of securing punishment - those society has, throughout our history, deemed most just - are through fines, community service, and imprisonment. Outside of a governmental context, these all would be crimes. If I were to forcibly take money from you, require you to work without pay, or lock you in a small room and make it impossible for you to leave, I would be arrested. But, for governments, this is fine. Why? Because when you violate the law, you forfeit rights. Essentially, by refusing to respect the rights of others, you lose some of yours. Loss of voting privileges is just another way to punish people. It's serious nature connotes the seriousness of the crime. Roger Clegg of the Center for Equal opportunity says ""It makes sense that felons should lose their right to vote. You don’t have a right to make the laws if you aren’t willing to follow them yourself. To participate in self-government, you must be willing to accept the rule of law. We don’t let everyone vote – not children, not noncitizens, not the mentally incompetent. There are certain minimum and objective standards of trustworthiness, responsibility, and commitment to our laws that we require before people are entrusted with a role in the solemn enterprise of self-government. Those who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens don’t meet those standards.""[1] Contention 3 - Voting rights should only be revoked for violent criminals. One area of common ground might be that there are many people who are felons that do no deserve that connotation. Felonies should be limited to the most serious crimes - things like arson, sex crimes (rape, child rape, incest), murder, and treason. In the past and presents, states have been too loose in regards to drug crimes. People can become felons for what should be minor drug crimes, if they should even be crimes at all. The definition of 'felon' should be reduced to violent or treasonous crimes - the most despicable and terrible of actions. It is on firm ground to say a convincted child rapist, murderer, or rapist has forfeited his right to decide laws for others through his actions. These violent criminals have rejected society and its laws, and society is well within its rights to reject them. Contention 4 - Rights could be restored through an arbitration committee After a felon has served their time, it might be reasonable to consider returning their right to vote. This would not be automatic - it might be handled in a similar way to how we handle parole - there might be a voting board, which would thoroughly vet the person to determine if they are truly sorry for what they have done and are committed to living by the laws of society. This would provide incentive for felons to reform - they will be accepted back into society if they are willing to accept the laws that the government of the people has made. Conclusion In short, there is nothing wrong with restricting voting rights for felons. It works with the American legal tradition, and is a reasonable way to punish those who have decided to reject the laws of society. While the definition of 'felon' might need to be smaller, and a system to allow restoration of rights might be reasonable, there is no reason a pedophile or murderer should be allowed to decide the laws of a society he plainly rejected.

S826727bc-A2483b077	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"In response to me asking how taking a felon’s right to vote protects other’s freedom con responds “Because voting is a civic duty necessary for a healthy society and criminals are anti-social with little care for civility.” Voting is a civic duty. Some criminals may have little care for civility, though to assume that for all is foolish. Likewise, a so called “felon” who has been in prison for 20 years may have an entirely different world view then when the crime was committed. Either way, as mentioned previously, felons would make up about 2% of the vote, and that is only if they all voted. Clearly there would be no harm done in allowing “felons” to retain the freedom to vote. ""I may not agree with what you have to say but I will fight to the death for your right to say it"" I maintain that this quote supports the principle behind this debate. Despite my opponent foolishly declaring that “criminals are anti-social with little care for civility” they are still part of society however removed they appear. They are still governed by the system. Again as the Declaration of Independence states “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed” Felons, without the right to vote cannot give consent to be governed and are therefore victims of tyranny. This is a violation of the founding principles of this nation. Con then says “You complain that minorities are disproportionately affected. I agree that is a problem but the problem is for another debate. That debate is about the failed war on drugs and the failed war on poverty.” I never made such an argument. Though it appears that con feels that minorities are disproportionately affected. This is a welcome endorsement in favor of the resolution. Conduct: Con has repeatedly ridiculed me in this debate. Saying things like “I can hardly believe anyone would make the argument…” and “Mind your own business.” These Ad Hominem statements have no place in debate. Con has also repeatedly committed the straw man fallacy saying “You also seem to think that Felons in America only lose their right to vote. They lose other rights also.” I never expressed such a view. “Your proposal here is to have a centralized government make a law to force states to act against our own will.” I never made such a proposal. I merely argued that Felons should retain the right to vote. Not once have I mentioned how this ought to be accomplished. Lastly and perhaps the least offensive “You complain that minorities are disproportionately affected.” I never made such a complaint. Though, it is a reasonable argument to make. I leave it to the voters to determine if the Straw man fallacy and Ad Hominem attacks are valid. Closing Statement: As con conceded, minorities are disproportionately affected. Allowing Felons to retain the right to vote poses no harm. As such, taking such a right away is tyrannical and against the principles this nation is founded on. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed”( Declaration of Independence) If the right to vote is taken away, our entire system of government cannot live up to its primary purpose. In the interest of our government filling its purpose, or in other words, securing the unalienable rights afforded to all men, it is only reasonable to conclude that Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S."	PRO	8
S826727bc-A49a83235	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"Rebuttal: Con says “I can hardly believe anyone would make the argument that they would want violent psychopaths and organized crime members to be casting votes from inside of the penitentiary.” It is not that I want or desire that psychopaths to vote, that would be irrelevant. The fact is that they should retain that right, otherwise they are victims of tyranny. Such would be a violation of the founding principles of this nation. Con says “I can accept what you and your peers want. I can not accept you meddling in my community and forcing us to bend to your totalitarian will. Mind your own business. Not every community will have the same wants as yours.” Again, this is not about what I want, rather about what is right. Taking away someone’s ability to have a say in how they are governed is the totalitarian path. You may not want to have felons vote, I accept that is your view but, as you said it…. perhaps you should mind your own business and not force others to bend to your totalitarian will. Con says “The Declaration of Independence is not a carefully thought out law but a cry for freedom from an oppressive centralized government.” While I agree that the Declaration of Independence is not a law, it was very well thought out. It was a cry for freedom from an oppressive government. Much of the grievance was a lack of representation in that oppressive government. Is this not a synonymous example for those who have their right to vote tyrannically taken from them. Con says “The Declaration of Independence is not a carefully thought out law but a cry for freedom from an oppressive centralized government. Your proposal here is to have a centralized government make a law to force states to act against our own will. Laws are violent things.” My opponent seems intent at straw manning my position. Rather, my position is that such a law that retained felon’s right to vote would curtail rule of the mob, or tyranny of the majority. Thus preserving freedom is on the side of voting rights, and totalitarian side is restricting such a vote. Con says “We designate an act a crime because it is injurious to public welfare. If you look at all such crimes you will find that someone is a victim and that victim has been deprived of their Human Rights. Their right to pursue life liberty and happiness. I see no problem in denying these offensive criminal their rights.” Again, my opponent’s arguments miss the mark. I certainly believe that when a crime is committed that action should be taken to preserve the liberty of others, often resulting in imprisonment and other actions. My issue is not in punishing crime, it rests solely on the right to vote. Con says “We deny inside traders access to the markets. Child molesters are denied privacy. Computer criminals are denied the use of the Internet. All are denied the use of weapons for self-defense. These decisions, as clearly prescribed in The Constitution of the United States of America, are left to the states.” Each are great example of how freedom is preserved by the action taken. How does taking a Felon’s right to vote protect other’s freedom. In the U.S. there are 5.58 Million Felons who are limited in voting rights. (1) There are 207.5 Million eligible voters. Giving felons the right to vote would hardly create a problem as it is would amount to 2% of the voter pool. Add that fact to con's view that we have ""Zero Representation because cause a ratio of representative to constituent is a million to one. That ridiculous ratio does not make a ""Representative Democracy"".” As Con seems to think voting abilities negligible due to numbers, as well as numbers show the minority that is felons in this nation, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no danger or freedom to be lost by allowing felons to vote. The only loss of freedom would result in taking away the right to vote from the felons themselves. Extended arguments: If the right to vote is taken away, our entire system of government cannot live up to its primary purpose. In the interest of our government filling its purpose, or in other words, securing the unalienable rights afforded to all men, it is only reasonable to conclude that Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S. I noticed on con’s profile that he has the following quote… ""I may not agree with what you have to say but i will fight to the death for your right to say it"" This nicely demonstrates the underlying principle. Regardless of our personal feelings of felon’s views, there is no loss in freedom or danger in allowing them to vote. Therefore it is their right that they should vote, and such a right should be protected from the tyranny of the majority. (1)http://sentencingproject.org..."	PRO	9
S8fa3a9aa-A4c1f4f43	In a Democratic Society, Felons Ought to Retain the Right to Vote	"Though my opponent's profile says he lives in India, this debate is about felons and the right to vote in a democratic society. I am unfamiliar with Indian laws and societal expectations, as well as their standards for democracy, and under the assumption that most debat.com members are from the US I will address this issue from an American standpoint, unless my opponent can show me a reason to do otherwise. Also, standards for felonies are no longer applied in other common law countries as they have been replaced with ""summary offences"" and ""indictable offences"". In modern democracies, a felon is someone convicted of a felony. Felonies under the US Criminal Code are generally offenses that mandate a prison term of one year or more. Anything less is generally a misdemeanor or civil offense. (http://www4.law.cornell.edu...) Because of the different gravity of different crimes which may be considered felonies, it is impossible to lay out a blanket ban on voting by convicted felons. Punishment for crimes in the US and other democracies is generally considered ""correction"" or rehabilitation, and the goal is to re-integrate rehabilitated criminals into society. The deprivation of life, liberty, and/or property is generally considered appropriate punishment for various felonies, and an assigned timeframe is allotted that is generally considered befitting the crime. The basic use of punishment and reward is the basis of all criminal theory. Ordinary crime is not a threat to the social order, and society needs criminal behavior and the legal responses to it to function properly. (http://www.criminology.fsu.edu...) Putting aside the fact that all 50 states allow felons to vote to some degree(http://www.ncsl.org...), I personally believe that to fully integrate a rehabilitated criminal into society he/she must first believe he/she will be allowed that opportunity. Indeed, living in a democratic society, the right to vote is an essential part of full integration into a democratic society. So unless felons are executed or jailed for life, the right to vote should be an incentive of completing rehabilitation when rehabilitation is an option. Now on to my opponent's contentions... My opponent's first contention is based on retribution to prevent chaos and despair. I point to the US where, again, all 50 states and DC allow felons to vote to some degree- some states only through a pardon, and the US has not devolved into chaos and despair. The US has stiff penalties for crimes such as murder, espionage, treason, and other felonies for which a criminal's voting rights may never be restored, and it has lesser penalties for, say, possession of more than one ounce of marijuana which is a felony in most states, and constitutes an average of 1 year in prison(www.norml.org). I assure you this crime is not grievous enough for society to devolve into chaos should it continue, and a person convicted of this crime is not necessarily too ""untrustworthy"" to be involved in electoral politics. My opponent's second contention, unfortunately, does not make much sense to me. I cannot imagine a democratic society NOT made up of people. In a democratic society of a few or millions of people, it would be up to those people to decide how felons should be treated. The former Assistant State Attorney General for the State Elections Division of Alabama says: ""Under the longstanding system, a felon may apply to regain his right to vote after serving his sentence and paying all fines and restitution that may be due. This is a sound practice. It ensures that only those criminals who have met their obligations to their victims and who have enough civic pride to apply for renewed voting rights can play a role in selecting our community, state and national leaders."" (http://www.al.com...). I don't contend that felons ""should have the right to vote in every circumstance and situation"", and it is both unreasonable and unrealistic to take an absolute position on an issue that will have varying degrees of circumstance, ie. a murderer vs. an old lady who assists inmates with legal issues without realizing she was breaking the law (http://www.ahrc.com...). My opponent's third contention only addresses murder. Even with murder there are several degrees. My opponent affirms that one right violation allows another rights violation to exist, but in the same paragraph he states that individuals in a society may not violate others' rights in a society. This is a contradiction, but I will nonetheless address the issue. The deprivation of rights for violation of rights is part of the criminal theory. It is necessary for the proper function of society, but the deprivation of rights should (in most cases) be employed as rehabilitation. Once all faults are corrected, fines paid, and punishment completed it should be recognized as such. The continued disenfranchisement of a convicted felon who has put effort into reintegration is unjust, and goes against the fundamentals of both the correctional system and democracy itself. My opponent's fourth contention is based on semantics, but he wrote the resolution, not me. In recognition of this clever trap, let's define ""ought"" in the context of the resolution and the debate: ought: —used to express obligation , advisability , natural expectation , or logical consequence All points can be argued for pro successfully, but please choose one so as not to turn this into a wasted debate about semantics. Should society be ""obligated""? No. My personal opinion is that a society attempting to be just will at least to some degree allow felons to vote based on established law, which would imply obligation to do so. Because it is my personal opinion, I would use my vote to ""advise"" society to allow felons to vote to some degree. It is a ""natural expectation"" of many criminologists as cited in my previous sources. It is also the ""logical consequence"" of laws already in place in the US. Thank you."	PRO	10
S826727db-A5ce54003	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"I will now begin by rebutting Pro's case from R2. Pro argues over Unalienable rights. Voting is not a right. As I have argued, in the 14th amendment it states that it isn't a given right to vote. It is up to the state in which they decide to let felons vote, or not vote. Pro arguing that voting for everyone is a right, is false. The 2nd part of the 14 Amendment can back this up. Pro then goes on to say ""We live in a society that requires of its government the protection and security of such rights."" Yet the 14th Amendment, it's not a validate right. The state can choose whether or not to enforce this so called ""Right"". Let's take freedom of speech for example. the Government can't tell the state whether or not the state can enforce this right, it's a given right. Voting, isn't. Pro argues the ""The Power of the People"" I am not entirely sure what he is arguing here. He gives us 2 quotes, and 1 sentence that doesn't say much nor explain what he is trying to argue here. Are you trying to say that if the government takes away a right, the people will rebell? That is what I'm getting at here. Pro's next argument: D: The whole picture We live in a society that accepts… 1: All people born equal with rights (Equal rights, yes. But these rights are temporarily taken away when the person has acted in poor misconduct.) 2: Government’s function is to secure unalienable rights (Not according the 2nd part of the 14th Amendment which states the States can decide whether or not a felon can vote.) 3: Government receives power through the consent of the governed via voting ( This doesn't mean that Felons should still enjoy freedom because they have murdered somebody. Consequences need to be bestowed so these people can learn from their mistakes. Doing so will also protect your city.)"	CON	11
S9762761d-A7a996a17	In a democractic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"NEGATIVE I negate: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote [Definitions] (1) Democracy: a government by the people in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by their elected officials (2) Felon: a person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year (3) Retain: to keep in possession or use [Observations] (1) Because America is a democracy, a society, and should not allow felons the privilege of voting, the United States complies with all restrictions in the resolution, thus implied by the resolution (2) The resolution clearly states ""felons"" versus ""ex-felons"". An ex-felon is somebody who has completed their sentence, and a felon, as stated in the resolution, is somebody currently serving their sentence. Therefore, my opponent must prove how letting felons vote in prison is upholding a just democracy [Value/Value Criterion] Value: Justice Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness The Negative values justice. Justice is implied by the resolution because it deals with the punishment of felons. In order for a society to be democratic, all punishment must be fair and just. If punishment is not fair and just, a democracy cannot prosper. In this debate, I will show why this punishment is perfectly just. I will show my value of justice through the maximization of fairness. Democracy is a majority rule. Currently, the United States is comprised of over 98% of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens, versus the less than 2% of society that are murders and rapists. 98 to 2, who should get the rights? To prove my point, I make the following arguments (1) Retribution. Retribution is giving punishment that is deserved, or punishment that fits the crime. When somebody commits a felony, say rape, they treat their victim as a moral non-entity. An entity is a human being, so treating somebody as a non-entity is treating somebody less than human. So, the government has an obligation to punish this criminal. Does the government then in turn rape the felon? Of course not. This would be treating the felon as a moral non-entity, just as he did to his victim. This is cruel and unusual punishment that would make the government no better than the felon. But, the government still has to punish the felon. What is the government to do? The government must treat the felon as a political non-entity, in order to punish the criminal, yet not be cruel and unusual. Treating a felon as a political non-entity includes revoking the privilege of voting. 2) Legal Consistency. When felons are incarcerated, they are essentially removed from society – both for the punishment of the criminal and for the safety of the rest of society. In their removal from society, they lose certain rights that they would normally possess; they lose their social rights and the freedom of activity, occupational rights and the freedom to engage in the workforce, parental rights and the freedom to raise children, etc. Why, then, should criminals be allowed to maintain their political rights and the freedom to vote? There are many rights which are more basic taken away from the individual during his imprisonment; if we are to uphold some level of legal consistence and be uniform and fair in the level of punishment afforded to prisoners, then there is no reason why we should afford felons the privilege of voting and every reason not to. 3) Double Standard. By affirming the resolution, you are essentially condoning violent acts, which, as a democratic society, we are morally obliged not to do. By affirming the resolution, you are giving felons superior rights. You are not only treating felons as equal, but you are giving them rights that make them superior to normal, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens. You make the law-breakers into the law-makers. By affirming the resolution, you are saying that people who brake the law in the most brazen way, by committing a felony, would be better than a law-abiding citizen because they broke the law and still have the same amount of rights. As you can see, this is simply wrong. Thank you, and it is for those reasons that I negate the resolution [Rebuttal] Value: Equality I have 3 responses --> equality (of rights) is impossible during incarceration. If felons were to be equal (in rights), then there would be no punishment. For example, the government puts you in jail. Right there, the government automatically takes away your right to liberty, pursuit of hapiness, and countless other rights -->My opponent is dejustifying all forms of punishment. If incarceration is unjust in and of itself, than there is no way for society to punish criminals --> This creates a 'double standard' (3rd contention) VC: Democracy I have 2 responses --> Democracy, as a form of government, must exhibit the ability to protect society. My opponent then must prove how dejustifying all punishment would help protect society --> Maximization of Fairness better upholds justice. For a government to be just, it must exhibit fairness to its consitituents. However, a democracy is not always just, and a just government is not always a democracy [Contentions] (1) Enfranchising felons is directly proportional to the increase of democracy My opponent is saying that letting these parasites of society vote will have more democracy I have two responses --> you cannot have 'more democracy' --> you can have more people participate in democracy, say children, but this would not uphold my value and value criteria (1a) Felon Disenfranchisement hurts democratic values and rights I have 2 responses --> democratic values include protecting society by way of just punishment. I have already proven how I have met that burden. Let's also not forget how they became a felon: by committing a felony. A felony inherently hurts society, and therefore government --> he brings in race towards the end. This is not resolutional. Because the court of law deals with punishment, you are essentially saying that the court is racist and corrupt. Because the court is racist and corrupt, then any punishment given by the court is corrupt, thus dejustifying all forms of punishment (1b) Restoration of the right to vote enables rehabilitation and reintegration into (a) democratic society I have two responses --> If you agree with my opponents logic, then the opposite (disenfranchising) felons automatically destroys the opportunity to rehabilitate them. Yet, this is false. Many people can become a member of society without having the right to vote. Look no further than Ted Stevens, the Alaskan senator who was found guilty of a felony, yet he serves the best nation in the world --> Once a felon re-enters society, they are considered an ex-felon by society, therefore, anything dealing with an ex-felon is not resolutional (In a democratic society, FELONS....) Cont 2: Allowing felons to vote, once released, is consistent with the return of other rights --> not necessarily. For example, the government revokes the right to bear arms, the right to serve on a jury, the right to privacy, ect. --> Once again, when a felon re-enters society, they are considered an ex-felon by said society, therefore not resolutional and or pertaining to the resolution Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and that is why I negate the resolution"	CON	12
S826727db-A4b3a15e3	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	Thank you to Lee001 for a great debate, it is always fun to debate you. Overview of my case: We live in a society that accepts… 1: All people born equal with rights 2: Government’s function is to secure unalienable rights 3: Government receives power through the consent of the governed via voting Con has claimed voting to not be a right. This misses the mark, as while I do argue that voting is a right my main argument is that the governments function is to protect and ensure rights and that the government can only do so legitimately through the consent of the governed. Voting is how that consent is given. Thus the impact of taking the vote away from felons is 1: Government cannot receive legitimate power through consent of the governed if the governed cannot vote. 2: Without consent or power the government cannot secure unalienable rights Con asks what I intended by my Power of the People segment stating “ Are you trying to say that if the government takes away a right, the people will rebel?” This is not at all what that portion of my argument is stating. Rather, I am stating that our society accepts that the people give power to the government through consent. Without consent people cannot give the government consent. Overview of Con’s case: Con has argued against the resolution essentially as follows…. 1: Felons fit into a category with the mentally underdeveloped, handicapped, or non-citizens and thus should not have voting rights. 2: Felons under the status quo do not have the right to vote and thus should not have the right to vote. 3: To have voting rights you must meet the specific criteria she lists. Number one is entirely untrue and dismissed. Number two is just a statement of the status quo not support for it. Number 3 is arbitrary and thus not strong support to negate. Conclusion: It becomes clear that If the right to vote is taken away, our entire system of government cannot live up to its primary purpose. In the interest of our government filling its purpose, or in other words, securing the unalienable rights afforded to all men, it is only reasonable to conclude that Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	PRO	13
S8fdf3c42-A72fea786	In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"I will begin with defending my case, and then move on to my opponents -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NC-------------------------------- Observation 1) --> my opponent did not attack this argument, thus you can extend this through the round. America can be used Observation 2) --> The UN does in fact define a felon in its database, accessible through their website, as ""a person who has been tried and found guilty of a serious criminal offense through a fair legal court and is currently serving their incarceration."" The United Nations also goes on to clarify what makes an ex-felon different from a felon. An ex-felon is ""one who has successfully completed their sentence and re-enters society."" The negative makes no argument against ex-felons, for ex-felons are not implied or stated in the resolution. The negative argues why felons, as stated in the resolution, ought not retain the right to vote --> Not one definition online or any dictionary I have found defines the word 'retain' in the future tense. For example, merriam webster defines retain as ""to keep in possession or use"", therefore implying not only the present tense but the constanst keeping of a right. This, along with the wording of the resolution and my first argument with the UN, points to the conclusion of an incarcerated felon Value: Justice --> His only argument to my value is that it is 'not inherent to the resolution'. Therefore, as long as I prove that it is implied by the resolution, then my value is extended through the round. The resolution deals with how we should deal with punishment and what rights are maintained or denyed in incarceration. (Turn)--> You can actually turn this against my opponents inferior value of a democratic society, because the resolution specifically deals with the punishment of prisoners, and for a society to be truly democratic, all punishment must be fair and JUST (justice) Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> As I already have stated, the resolution states a felon. I have already proven why it deals with incarcerated felons, just look to my defending of my second observation. Just as the affirmative made no attempt of arguing incarcerated felons, the negative makes no attempt in arguing an ex-felon because it is not inherent to the resolution. Contentions: 1) Retribution: --> a) Because a felon, by definition, is one who is serving their incarceration, once they re-enter society and thus the contract, they are no longer a felon, thus not inherent to the resolution --> b) Taking away the right to vote and influence government is perfectly proportionate, for when one commits a felony they physically, mentally, or financially take or restrict someone else's rights, and thus inherently hurts the government. A felon hurts society, which is why society (as part of the jury) sentences a felon to imprisonment. Because a felon also hurts the government, the government has a right to restrict or take away a felon's rights, such as political rights and the freedom to vote --> c) this is simply wrong and furthermore proves my opponent's poor logical reasoning. Let's take kidnap, for example, because my opponent brought it up. The Free Dictionary defines kidnap as 'to seize and detain unlawfully'. Because the government's incentive is not to cause pain (as a kidnapers is) but rather to protect society, as well as the fact that the government is not breaking any laws ('unlawfully'), this argument is dropped. Once again, the government does not rape rapists or steal millions from people who commit fraud, because the government cannot treat a felon as a moral non-entity, and thus must treat the felon as a political non-entity (because the government still has an obligation to punish the felon) 2) Legal Consistency -->a) He says that we do not have legal consistency because of the length of incarceration, but I do not argue that. Let's take parental rights, for instance, because I argue them as an example. You do not lose your parental rights while incarcerated in Texas and retain them in New York. I am arguing that for a government to be fair and just, it must uphold legal consistency via rights during incaraceration. Because 48/50 states, or 96%, disenfranchise during imprisonment, the government should be able to disenfranchise in all states (the remaining 4%) --> b) Once again, when a felon re-enters society, they are now considered an ex-felon by society, because the payment to society (imprisonment) is over and repaid. However, because a felony inherently hurts the government, the government now has an obligation to punish the felon. The government then takes away the felons say in said government. 3) Double Standard --> a) This is nothing new. The government also restricts rights of ex-felons through the violation of the right to bear arms, violation of the right to serve on a jury...(etc) Still, however, this deals with ex-felons, versus felons. My opponent essentially agrees with the negative when he says that I am ""undoing the balance incarceration achieves."" My opponent then in turn agrees that disenfranshisement is justified while incarcerated, and because felons are CURRENTLY serving their sentence, he agrees with the negative ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AC---------------------------------- Value: Democratic Society --> As I have proven, justice is the 'higher standard'. Both are implied by the resolution, but for a society to be democratic it must uphold justice through punishment VC: Maximizing Participation --> Not inherent to the resolution. My criteria is better to uphold justice because the negative argues how a nation with less participation can be equally, if not, superior on a justice scale to a nation with more 'participation'. --> Also, letting children (who are citizens) vote would increase participation. As you can see, however, this would not increase justice or lead to a strong democracy Observations: 1) Felons and ex-felons --> a) when a felon commits a felony, the government, because the felon has not fully repaid his debt to the government (he repaid his debt to society during imprisonment) aknowledges the felon as a felon. However, the resolution implies how society should punish this criminal, and upon re-entry of society, society essentially views the felon as an ex-felon, thus anything pertaining to an ex-felon is not resolutional. -->b) All felonies are committed in the 'past tense'. For example, you would not be on trial for ""is killing"", but rather ""have murdered"". My opponent is saying that you cannot punish a felon for a past occurrence. But, because all felonies are committed in the past tense, my opponents logical reasoning is to dejustify all punishment, because all felonies have already been committed. (Turn)--> My opponent is dejustifying all punishment, and for a democratic society (his value) to exist, there must be punishment to insure the protection of said democratic society Contentions 1) Society uses disenfranshisement in order to prevent contestation of existing values --> My opponent is essentially saying that we cannot force felons to be second class citizens. This is wrong for 3 reasons: 1) Becoming a second-class citizen means losing some rights. If felons did not lose any rights in jail, then punishment could not exist. Once again, my opponent is saying that all punishment is unjust, which goes against his value 2) Felons have brought this on themselves. By comitting a felony, they treat their victim as a second class citizen. 3) (Turn) This goes against my opponents observation of felons being felons for life. If we are to not make them second class citizens upon re-entry, then we would not be treating them as felons for life"	CON	14

When looking at the basis of the resolution, we read in the first prepositional phrase ""in a democratic society,"" therefore the resolution assumes that felon disenfranchisement is taking place in a democratic framework. Even if some people would view those preferences as ""bad"" society, a procedural view of democracy would hold that there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected and equality of all is the implied value. To define key terms: Felons - A person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. Democracy (root of democratic) - Of, characterized by, or advocating democracy, Of or for the people in general; popular, Believing in or practicing social equality The value for this round will be equality, and my criterion will be democracy. This means that whoever allows for the equality by the ways of democracy, will win this round. This is a fair value and criterion because the resolution is talking about what is best for a democratic society, ergo my criterion; and equality is essential to a democracy, ergo my value. Moreso, a democracy is defined as in having or practicing social equality and inversely, without equality, a full democracy cannot be established. CONTENTION ONE: ENFRANCHISING FELONS IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE INCREASE OF DEMOCRACY A. FELON DISENFRANCHISEMENT HURTS DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND RIGHTS Mauer, Marc, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, ""Felon Disenfranchisement: A Policy Whose Time Has Passed?"" American Bar Association, http://www.abanet.org..., accessed September 9, 2008 Regarding individuals who complete their sentence, it is difficult to develop a compelling argument for the denial of voting rights. Americans long have professed that once you ""pay your debt to society,"" you are free to rejoin the community. But a felony conviction may continues to deny these rights of citizenship decades after a sentence has been completed, even for a one-time, nonviolent offense. (Regrettably, policymakers in recent years enacted a series of collateral consequences of conviction, many tied specifically to drug offenses, that also extend after sentence. These include bans on receiving welfare assistance, living in public housing, and obtaining financial aid for higher education.) But serious questions can be raised as well regarding the loss of fundamental rights for people currently serving a felony sentence, whether in prison or on probation or parole. Our legal system generally makes a distinction between punishment-the loss of liberty whether in prison or on probation-and the loss of rights. The only exceptions generally conceded by law and policy are those exercises of speech that might conflict with public safety concerns. If we think of voting more broadly, as a fundamental expression of speech, then disenfranchisement becomes an even greater challenge for a democratic society. Suppose, for example, a legislator proposed a bill to make it unlawful for a probationer to write a letter to the editor or to participate in a protest rally. Surely few policymakers or citizens would find this an appropriate consequence of a conviction. Yet in the twenty-nine states that currently prohibit probationers from voting, such restrictions on political expression are firmly in place. The traditional goals of sentencing also leave little justification for disenfranchisement and most other collateral consequences of conviction. Other than serving a retributive function, disenfranchisement certainly does not meet the goals of incapacitation or deterrence. Individuals who are not already deterred from crime by the threat of incarceration are unlikely to be swayed by the prospect of losing their right to vote. Placing a character test on voting eligibility also is reminiscent of past practices that run counter to modern notions of democratic procedure. Once we begin to impose character requirements, voting slips back from being a right for all Americans to a privilege granted by the powerful. The racial impact of disenfranchisement policies is sometimes justified as an inevitable if unfortunate aspect of a race-neutral criminal justice system: if members of a particular racial or ethnic group are more involved in crime, the consequent disproportionate loss of voting rights is merely a result of their activity. Such an argument, though, ignores the compelling evidence of discriminatory racial dynamics in the criminal justice system-racial profiling by law enforcement agencies, the racially disparate prosecution of the war on drugs, and glaring inequities in adequacy of counsel as a function of both race and class. Affirming the resolution allows for reenfranchisement, which changes how felons function in the electoral system. B. RESTORATION OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE ENABLES REHABILITATION AND REINTEGRATION INTO DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY Mauer, Marc, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, ""Felon Disenfranchisement: A Policy Whose Time Has Passed?"" American Bar Association, http://www.abanet.org..., accessed September 9, 2008 In a more positive vein, the restoration of voting rights can be seen as being in harmony with the rehabilitative goal of sentencing. If an objective of sentencing is to encourage offenders to become less antisocial, then it is in society's interest to engage offenders in productive relationships with the community. Voting is clearly one means of doing so. Such a rationale is employed by the many nations (and the states of Maine and Vermont) that do not relate voting rights to criminal punishment and permit even prisoners to vote. By the standards of most democratic nations, American disenfranchisement policies are extreme, as is our excessive use of imprisonment. No other democratic nation disenfranchises former offenders for life; some countries deny voting rights to citizens after they have completed a prison sentence, but this generally is for a limited period of time and for specific offenses. During the past decade, constitutional courts in Canada, Israel, and South Africa have affirmed the fundamental right of all citizens, including prisoners, to be part of the electorate. The Israeli case is particularly intriguing because it resulted from a challenge to the voting rights of Yigal Amir, the man convicted of killing former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Reintegration is a key step to achieve a truly democratic society, which increases the legitimacy of democracy. Democracy impacts to providing the most social justice through the protection of rights, both on a domestic and international scale. CONTENTION 2: Allowing felons to vote, once released, is consistent with the return of other rights. Jeffrey Reiman, ""Liberal and Republican Arguments against the Disenfranchisement of Felons,"" Criminal Justice Ethics, 2005 Technically, disenfranchisement is not considered part of an offender's sentence but only a ""collateral consequence"" of conviction. Consequently, one rarely sees judges defending disenfranchisement as punishment. With regard to imprisoned felons, the argument implied in this rhetorical question has some force. Because the idea of Felon Disenfranchisement does not promote the best for society in the form of the preservation of democracy and the creation of justice, the reverse must also be true. If Felons were re-enfranchised It would strengthen the democratic process and would be the most just solution because it preserves democracy by means of marketable ideas being expressed."	PRO	16

Regarding these incurable criminals who selfishly deny others their human rights, Kasmic wants to give them a share of power in the governance of our society. To that I say ""NO!"". I will painfully accept the influence a few states will have on our nation by allowing these incurable criminals who have proved themselves to be chronic transgressors of of the boundaries necessary for a healthy society to have some influence on my children's future. These destructive people chose to not be governed at all. You too can make that choice just Step out your door and hurt another citizen.

As far as ""The War on Minorities"" goes, one that Kasmic and I agree needs a solution, does not make banishing incurable psychopaths a wrong measure for the protection our society. It is the wars on the minorities that is the problem. We wrongfully banish these unfortunate people who are victimized arrested and imprisoned by an already corrupt and criminal system. We do not need more of the criminally insane to contribute to this already terribly flawed government. All in all this debate here is about states rights.

S9762761d-Ac4fe4022	In a democractic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"His case: Overview: The major flaws of his argumentations are his numerous assumptions. From the very beginning of this debate, he frames it under a ""just"" society or attaining ""justice."" However, the way he reasons to attaining justice is the implications of the resolution and the implication he correlates with democracy. Since the resolution is framed under a predicated democracy, we must view this procedurally: there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected. He offers no brightline as to what is the universal concept of ""just"" or attaining justice is. This means that under the democratic framework, justice can never be attained. His definition of ""democracy"" indicates governed by the people. Inversely though—the majority of the people's decision or consensus is what determines a decision rather than whether it is ""just or not"" Observation 2: Felons and exfelons are both inevitably put into society. Because exfelons are a product of once-felons, the debate should centralize around HOW felons should be conducted in the status quo and post-resolution. Contention 1: Retribution The first line of his contention states that it is giving punishment that is ""deserved"" or punishment that fits the crime, but there can never be a clear brightline as to what is ""deserved"" or ""not"" Felons will use this non-delineated brightline of what is deserved or not as a loophole to perform their actions in a different society or framework that doesn't impact the magnitude of ""deserved"" as badly as the other one does. The denotation and predication of this contention is also off since it assumes that the punishment of the government to the felon has to be the equivalent of what the felon did. For example, if a felon was convicted of rape, that does NOT necessarily mean the government has to rape the felon back. Instead, the focus should be on the magnitude of the punishment towards the felon. For the magnitude of the punishment, he assumes that we must ALWAYS treat EVERY felon as a political non-entity. This is flawed for two subpoints a) It assumes that all felons are convicted of crimes that need the magnitude of dehumanization and b) there is one alternative or one type of punishment that is to be ultimately attained by these felons. It fails to regard other types of punishment that would sever the impact of how rehabilitation into society could be performed. 2) Flaw- ""Why, then, should criminals be allowed to maintain their political rights and the freedom to vote? There are many rights which are more basic taken away from the individual during his imprisonment?"" Let's take a look at this sentence and thematic concept. First off, the first sentence implies that maintaining political rights and the freedom to vote is of utmost greater magnitude than any of the implied correlative comparisons. The immediate sentence after that then goes on to state that there are many MORE BASIC rights taken away. Exactly, since there are so many of these basic rights taken away from the felon during their imprisonment, the magnitude of taking away the right to vote or the right to possess societal importance is unnecessary and past the prerequisite of basic rights being taken away. Since there are basic rights taken away, then there is a net loss of the felon's rights in society. As long as there is a net loss of the right to society, the felon is being shunned or punished for their activity. Cross apply Contention 1 Subpoint A—it does a good job of explaining how the loss of the right to vote is an ADDITIONAL consequence pass the prerequisites. ""Other than serving a retributive function, disenfranchisement certainly does not meet the goals of incapacitation or deterrence. Individuals who are not already deterred from crime by the threat of incarceration are unlikely to be swayed by the prospect of losing their right to vote. "" Look further into my contention as well it also places an impact on the unnecessary removal of the right to vote: ""Once we begin to impose character requirements, voting slips back from being a right for all Americans to a privilege granted by the powerful."" In other words, to prevent a tyranny or autonomy by one, centralized force, instilling the right to vote to these felons is what keeps the democracy upheld. The syntax he also uses in this contention with ""fair"" and ""basic"" ties hand in hand with the overview argument—it's an assumed value that can never be reached by universal consensus or by his own definition of democracy. Contention 3- Double Standard This contention is the epitome of too many assumptions. Look to his first line ""essentially condoning violent acts."" This is flawed for two reasons a)Look to Contention 1, Subpoint A – Turn: by not upholding the right to vote to the majority of the people and practicing social equality (definition of democracy) you are condoning tyrannistic autonomy b)If we were to look at his own value justice, by negating something on the ""just"" reason or the just way wouldn't necessarily be the equivalence of condoning the negative option. For example, if I didn't want to give money to a poor robber, I would not be condoning poverty, but rather acting on a just decision –that giving money to a robber or burglar is not just. Turns his own value Look to his last sentence ""By affirming the resolution, you are saying that people who brake the law in the most brazen way, by committing a felony, would be better than a law-abiding citizen because they broke the law and still have the same amount of rights."" This is flawed for four reasons a)If they had the same amount of rights for something they committed, they would not be SUPERIOR to law-abiding citizens but rather the right that both are instilled with is of great magnitude to the society/democracy b)They would not have the same amount of rights. Your contention 2 tells me that they are revoked ""certain, basic rights"" c)Not all of what felons convict are ""the most brazen way"". Poor generalization d)Extend/Cross Apply my previous argument that different states/societies/frameworks have different punishments/retributions. Different types of behaviors/performances in different areas equate to differentiating magnitudes of what they actually did. My case: The value debate 1)Great way to read my value out of context. I'm not talking about any attainment of equality during incarceration nor the magnitude of punishment. The value is there to support the prepositional phrase of the resolution ""in a democratic society"" a democratic society usurps the idea of ""equality"" or social equality (refer to my definition). To sustain social equality, there has to be a uniform approach to treating these felons post and pre convictions 2)No warrant to dejustification. C/A no standard of ""just"" The criterion debate 1)His definition never ergo-s ""protecting society"" Rather, look to my uniformed definition—the practicing of social equality and the uniform approach to felons pre and post conviction 2)Contradicting. The first part of his argument states that maximization of fairness better upholds justice. Then he goes on to state that democracy is not always just. Flawed for two reasons a.No brightline to just or justice b.No brightline to what is ""fair"" or ""not"". If the universal ruling of the people turned out to be ""unfair"" would it yield to be ""fair""? Contentions: 1)Great way to dehumanize them by calling them parasites 2)Not ""more democracy"" but a comparison of the magnitude/quality of how you uphold the ideal 3)Children do not have the right to vote.

Sb20f758c-Ad5f281b1	In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote	"As stated by Former Supreme court justice the late Thurgood Marshall ""It is doubtful...whether the state can demonstrate either a compelling or rational policy interest in denying former felons the right to vote. [Ex-offenders] have fully paid their debt to society. They are as much affected by the actions of government as any other citizen, and have as much of a right to participate in governmental decision-making. Furthermore, the denial of a right to vote to such persons is hindrance to the efforts of society to rehabilitate former felons and convert them into law-abiding and productive-- (dissent of Richardson v Ramirez) Because I agree With Justice Marshall I affirm the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote."" My Core Value will be that Of Justice defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as ""the administration of law or some other authority according to the principles of just behavior and treatment (oxford) My Criterion Is Preservation of Democracy. Preservation of Democracy means to do what is best to preserve the democratic process and democracy itself. This fulfils Justice because in a democratic society, justice is achieved when the people run the society and everybody has an equal voice. John Rawls Believed The three most fundamental ideas political culture of a democratic society are that citizens are free and equal, and that society should be a fair system of cooperation. 1st contention It must be agreed that racial prejudice in society is a fundamentally unjust principle. Now I would like to point out that the judiciary statistically is prejudice against ethnic minorities. Blacks comprise 13 percent of the national population, but 30 percent of people arrested, 41 percent of people in jail,and 49 percent of those in prison.. Nationally, blacks are incarcerated at 8.2 times the rate of whites. That is, a black person is 8.2 times more likely to be in prison than a white person. Further around 70% of all felons exonerated on DNA evidence are black. So not only are black overrepresented in prison, but there is evidence that the judiciary tends to be racially prejudice. 13% of all Black males are disenfranchised making for 1/3 of the total disenfranchised population. 13% is also just a national Average. In Florida and Alabama 31% of all Blacks are permanently disenfranchised. Nationally 2% of the Population is disenfranchised, However, 13.1% of Adult Black Men are disenfranchised. As African Americans are an ethnic Minority it makes no sense for them to represent a prison majority. Also as I have said many of them have been wrongfully convicted so that a disproportionate amount of Blacks are unfairly losing their democratic right to vote without even having committed a crime. This is No way Is Just and does nothing to preserve the democratic process and democracy. 2nd Contention The United Nations released a ""Standard Minimum Rule for the Treatment of Prisoners"" that stated ""The treatment of prisoners should emphasize not their exclusion from the community but their continuing part in it"" This standard establishes that it is the best interest of society to fully rehabilitate ex-prisoners back into society because it provides for the betterment of that society. According to statistics taken in 1998 a total of 3.9 million adults, or 2.0 percent of the eligible voting population, is currently or permanently disenfranchised as a result of a felony conviction. Also around 30% of all eligible black males can not vote in election due to felon disenfranchisement. ï¿½ Six states, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wyoming, exclude from the vote more than 4 percent of their adult population. And each Florida and Texas Disenfranchise more than 600,000 people. ï¿½ Lets look at the democratic implications of felon Disenfranchisement In 1996 the number of disenfranchised eligible voters in Florida was 647,100. In the 2000 Elections George Bush won Florida By 1725 Votes. The state of Florida has 27 Electoral votes. In that election George Bush won the presidency by 5 electoral votes. If all 647,100 of these Voters were re-enfranchised and 1726 more of those voters cast ballots in favor of Al Gore than in favor of George Bush the presidential election would have turned another way. So, by disenfranchising voters, Florida brought down the potential voter turnout, and by doing so restricted the democratic process. Because Disenfranchisement Restricts the democratic process it cannot be just as it does not help to preserve Democracy. The fact that these voters were disenfranchised caused a serious lapse in democracy, and therefore did no justice. Because Disenfranchisement restricts the democratic process the resolution is a just principle. 3rd Contention Among democratic countries the united states may have the strictest felon disenfranchisement laws. We are the only known democracy in which felons who have either fully completed or been released from, their sentence are still permanently disenfranchised. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ""Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives…"" This Document establishes basic human rights in governments internationally and states quite clearly that every citizen has an innate right to take part and vote in elections. Because Felon disenfranchisement does not respect this basic right then it is an unjust principle that in no way, provides for the preservation of democracy. If a country can decide it can break any universal code as it please it would not be in the best interests of society and would not in any way preserve the democratic process. Conclusion: Because, as I have proved, the idea of Felon Disenfranchisement does not promote the best for society in the form of the preservation of democracy and the creation of justice, the reverse must also be true. If Felons were re-enfranchised it would strengthen the democratic process and would be the most just solution because it preserves democracy."	PRO	20
S8fdf3c42-A5d56fd00	In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"I negate: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote For clarity I offer the following definitions: 1. Democratic society: government dictated by the populous 2. Felons: people who have committed a felony 3. Retain: to keep and secure for future use For analysis of the resolution I offer the following observations: 1. The resolution specifies felons. This includes people in jail and those who have finished their time of incarceration. This is true for 2 reasons: First, when a person commits a felony it remains on their permanent civil record. Thus, the government considers you a ""felon"" Second, the definition of a felon implies this observation. The definition states ""people who have committed a felony."" The ""have"" indicated past events. 2. The affirmative burden is thus to prove that felons in society ought to retain the right to vote. The affirmative values a democratic society. Since the resolution explicitly states a democratic society, this should be the superior value. This value is achieved by the criterion of Maximizing Participation. The resolution assumes that felon disenfranchisement is taking place in a democratic framework. Democracy is unique as a system of government because it allows people to rule themselves, and it is generally viewed that democracies that give more power to the people are better than democracies that give less power to the people. While there are many definitions of democracy, most would discourage felon disenfranchisement.If democracy is a procedure for individuals to aggregate their preferences to make policies, then any disenfranchisement is anti-democratic because it excludes the preferences of one group of individuals. Even if some people would view those preferences as ""bad"" society, a procedural view of democracy would hold that there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected. If democracy is based on participation and consent, felon disenfranchisement is wrong because felons cannot give consent to the laws that govern them because they cannot express their preferences through voting. Contention I: Society uses disenfranchisement in order to prevent contestation of existing values Whether or not they are rooted in a similar insecurity, it is clear that the justification for disenfranchisement and Rawls's reliance on punishment as a stabilizing device both follow from the impulse to protect society's standards from contestation. In Rawls's case, one's ability to contest society's standards is closed off by the imposition of the label ""unreasonable""; in the case of disenfranchisement, this labeling is complemented by the explicit loss of one's political status.The criminal, in each instance, is created as the ""other"" to ward off the potential contestation of society's norms.' For Rawls, the assumption of strict compliance and the emphasis on consensus lead citizens of his well-ordered society to view the criminal as a ""bad character"" deserving ofpunishment, even if such punishment is illiberal from the standpoint of justice itself. With disenfranchisement, the act of creation is even clearer: The revocation of the right to vote itself differentiates the criminal as abnormal-it is a permanent mark of a lower status. ""The process of making the criminal,"" Frank Tannenbaum writes, ""is a process of tagging, defining, identifying,segregating, describing, emphasizing, making conscious and self- conscious; it becomes a way of stimulating, suggesting, emphasizing, and evoking the very traits that are complained of. The emphasis on the individual nature of the criminal's act or character makes it appear as if the criminal brings this process and the resulting lower status on himself, but society imposes it, acting to prevent a threat to the maintenance of its established standards. [Rebuttal] ""The resolution clearly states ""felons"" versus ""ex-felons"". The United Nations defines an ex-felon as somebody who has completed their sentence, and a felon, as stated in the resolution, as somebody currently serving their sentence. Therefore, my opponent must prove how letting felons vote in prison is upholding a just democracy"" --> This is wrong for three reasons: First, my opponents definition of a felon contradicts this observation on the fact that his definition implies past action. Meaning that his definition implies the fact that convition is after the fact. I.e. he is back in society Second, he never provides a definition of retain, thus we must to look to my definition which implies future use. Third, my opponent is wrong on the UN definition. The UN never makes a distinction between the two. Value: Justice --> Not inherent to the resolution, thus my value is superior. Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> (Turn) Use my opponents criteria against him. Fairness implies a fair action. When a felon returns to society, it is only fair that he retains his right to vote, since he has paid his debt to society. 1. Retribution --> My opponents point of retribution is no longer retribution for 3 reasons: First, retribution implies a contract. Once a felon has served his time of incarceration he returns to society, thus reentering the contract. Second, retribution implies proportionality. I.e. the punishment must fit the crime. Take away the right to vote is not proportionate because it is not a sufficient mechanism in the action of balancing the scale of justice. Third, my opponents argument is contradictory to itself and dejusitifes incarceration. For example, someone kidnaps. In turn the government puts them in jail. According to my opponenet this is unjustified because it is making the government a kidnapper. 2. Legal Consistency --> This is wrong for two reasons First, this is contradictory to my opponents observation 1 (US specific observation). This point may be true in a non-federal government, like in France. However in the US this doesn't hold water because we have a federal system. I.e. the state and national government share power. This impacts my opponents contention 2 because in the US we do not have state consistency. For example, a rapist in NY may receive 15 years in prison, while a rapist in Texas may receive 45. Cross apply this to disenfranchisement. Maine and Vermont do not disenfranchise, while Arizona and New Mexico do. Turn this against my opponenet. His logic leads the conclusion that disenfranchisement is unjust because it is not consistent. Second, when felons enter society, this is the governments stamp on the pay back to society. According to my opponents logic, we should keep them in jail forever, or just kill them to make a more consistent legal system. This is obviously unjust, and thus contradicts his value. 3. Double Standard Simply turn this argument against my opponenet. By taking away a felon's right to vote is undoing the balance that incarceration achieves. When felons reenter society after incarceration, they are on on equal terms once again. However, when you disenfranchise them you are devaluing them compared to the rest of society. Therefore, it is the negative which is creating the double standard. Thank you ladies and gentlemen"	PRO	21
S826727bc-Abc5ae673	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	Thank you PatulousDescry for accepting this debate and good luck! Con says “If I understand what you just posted it seems as if you would like all felons to have the right vote including the ones who have not yet finished serving their sentences.” Yes, that is the case. Con says “You also seem to think that Felons in America only lose their right to vote.” That is not what I think at all, just not relevant to the debate topic at hand. Let’s not start this off with a straw man fallacy.... Con says “Freedom, liberty and self determination are always a better course than Totalitarianism.” I agree which is why I am in favor of the resolution. Arguments: We live in a society that accepts the notion of unalienable rights. As a society we accept that the main duty of a government is to secure such rights. Such a government receives their power from the consent of the governed. In our society this is done through voting. A: Unalienable Rights “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” (Declaration of Independence) Unalienable: “impossible to take away or give up” (1) We live in a society that accepts the concept that some rights are unalienable B: The Duty of Government “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men” (Declaration of Independence) “Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority;” (2) We live in a society that requires of its government the protection and security of such rights C: The Power of the People “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed”(Declaration of Independence) “Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law.”(2) We live in a society that dictates that the power of government come from the consent of the governed. D: The whole picture We live in a society that accepts… 1: All people born equal with rights 2: Government’s function is to secure unalienable rights 3: Government receives power through the consent of the governed via voting What happens when we take away the right to vote? 1: Government cannot receive power through consent of the governed if the governed cannot vote. 2: Without consent or power the government cannot secure unalienable rights Conclusion: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed”( Declaration of Independence) If the right to vote is taken away, our entire system of government cannot live up to its primary purpose. In the interest of our government filling its purpose, or in other words, securing the unalienable rights afforded to all men, it is only reasonable to conclude that Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S. (1) http://www.merriam-webster.com...

Because exfelons are a product of once-felons, the debate should centralize around how felons should be conducted in the status quo and post-resolution"" --> Felons are not necessarily always put back into society. People on death row and people serving life sentences are never released --> When my opponent states 'status quo', he is referring to incarceration. This means that he does believe that at least part of this debate is to be discussed on behalf of incarcerated felons (a.k.a. felons). He then goes on to say 'post-resolution'.

If we have to structure debates on things after the resolution, then you must also have to structure such debates on 'pre resolution'.

He stated, and I agree, that this action of revoking the freedom to vote is in a democratic framework. Anything else, would be simply unresolutional ""For example, if a felon was convicted of rape, that does not necessarily mean the government has to rape the felon back."" --> Thank you, that is exactly what I argue. Because my opponent agrees with me, you can extend this contention throughout the round. Because the government cannot treat a consitituent as a moral non-entity (i.e rape them), they must furthermore treat them as a political non entity so the punishment fits the crime and it is not cruel and unusual Cont 2: Legal Consistency ""First off, the first sentence implies that maintaining political rights and the freedom to vote is of utmost greater magnitude than any of the implied correlative comparisons."" --> Nope, not true. I argue that any system is better of under a perfectly consistent system. We must be uniform and fair in the punishment that is dealt to felons, and voting negative better achieves that. I argue that more intrinsic rights are being taken away, and taking away politcal rights are justified through the uniformity of punishment afforded to prisoners ""As long as there is a net loss of the right to society, the felon is being shunned or punished for their activity"" -->There is no right to society in incarceration. The government puts you in jail BECAUSE you hurt society, and in order to protect society, must restrict all influence of the felon to society, for example, the right to vote Cont 3: Double Standard ""By not upholding the right to vote by the majority of the people and practicing social equality (definition of democracy) you are condoning tyrannistic autonomy"" --> Because my opponent did not attack my first observation, America can be used. So, I argue, would not letting these less than 2% of people vote, still be upholding the right to vote for the 'majority of the people'? Of couse, 98% is a majority --> The definition of democracy is not social equality. Although it is portrayed here in America, the two terms do not go hand and hand. Also, it is impossible to give social equality through incarceration. There is no punishment without rights being taken away. Besides, doesn't communism have more social equality than, I don't know, democracy? ""Not all of what felons convict are 'the most brazen way'. Poor Generalization"" --> Yes, they have defied society, the government, and everything society and the government has put forth. Because there are only two types of crime, misdeamenors and felonies, someone who commits a felony would be breaking the law in a more brazen way I will now move on to attack my opponents case Value: Equality --> Justice is implied by the resolution, and higher on a resolutional scale. Because we are dealing with the punishment of felons, we must be just (giving each their due), not necessarily equal. For example, raping somebody does not warrant equal punishment as insider trading does. Thus, justice is the 'higher standard' VC: Democracy --> implied more by the resolution than his value, however, a just government is not always democratic and a democratic govenrment is not always just.

But, because I deserve to win this debate, I shall --> a parasite is anything that impedes a necessary process. While felons are incarcerated, they become a burden to the State. Because they impede the process of the state trying to progress the rest of society, they are, indeed, parasites. ""A felony inherently hurts society and therefore government"" --> I stand by this argument. Any felony committed causes pain to a member of society (society). The government is also hurt, because one of its constituents was inflicted pain upon.

S8fa3a9aa-A8b674b8e	In a Democratic Society, Felons Ought to Retain the Right to Vote	Today, we live in a world in which societies need authority. People are always self interested which is why most societies cannot flourish. Due to this fact, we must protect society and the people who believe in the society. However, the only way to do this is to find a way enforce people to respect the society. This leads to my value which is justice and my value criterion which is Retribution of individuals in society. I would like to clarify the following definitions from the Merriam-Webster's dictionary. Democracy= rule of majority Innocent= free from legal guilt or fault Felon= person who has committed a legal guilt or fault which is very serious; not innocent My first contention is that every society, including democracy requires for a discipline or something to keep balance and order. For society to survive, it must have a discipline. Some action must be done to balance out the unlawful actions that have taken place, which can greatly damage the society. Without some form of retribution, society would be essentially condoning felony. So then, it would be considered okay for me to just murder someone. Without retribution, any democratic society would devolve into chaos and despair, something as a society we are morally obliged to avoid. My second contention is that the idea of a democratic society can be in all scales large or small. The society could be a few people, or it could be millions of people. They may not even be people! With this being said, we do not know if the society is full of felons and would want to vote nor do we know if the society is free from felons. With this inconsistency, the affirmative must bear the burden of proving that felons should have the right to vote in every circumstance and situation. My third contention is that Individuals in a society may not violate other's rights in a society. The social contract, stated by John Locke, states that the people forfeit some rights to government in order to secure more rights. It also states that when an individual violates the rights of others within this government, it is the peoples and government's responsibility to act against said individual. One right violation (that of life, which is needed to utilize all other rights) allows another right violation (disenfranchisement) to exist. This retribution is needed in order to sustain order. My fourth contention is that People of a society do not owe felons the right to vote. Ought can mean 2 different things. In less serious situations, it can be used as a mere suggestion. For example, you ought to try the apple with peanut butter. In more situations, it is used as owing to. For example, the criminal ought to turn himself in. We can established that this is a very serious situation. Therefore, ought can be defined as owing. However, we do not owe these felons for anything for they have done more harm to society than contribution.	CON	24

An ex-felon is ""one who has successfully completed their sentence and re-enters society."" --> I have two responses: First, my opponenet never provides a direct link for this site, and from my research the UN does not define it. Second, even if you don't buy this response, simply use logic. It is impossible for the UN to define the word ""felon"" because most nations have abandoned the use of the word, and ergo make no legal distinctions between felons and misdemeanors, such as the US. Not one definition online or any dictionary I have found defines the word 'retain' in the future tense. For example, merriam webster defines retain as ""to keep in possession or use"", therefore implying not only the present tense but the constanst keeping of a right. --> I have two responses: First, turn this against my opponenet. If he believes this should be the definition of retain for the round, he himself does not uphold it because he never categorically proves the resolution false under this pretense. Second, under LD this definition is null and void isnce it was put into the round not as a formal definition (i.e. in the case) but in a rebuttal. Therefore, my formal definition is superior. V: Justice --> Fine, I concede this value. However, if he does not achieve the ""democratic society"" burden within the resokution, he should fail for the debate. Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> My opponent makes a crucial mistake with this VC First, he never defines what fairness is. Second, I will use Rawl's understanding of fairness which is the idea of the first principle, which implies maximizing rights for everyone. Ergo, maximizing the right to vote. 1. Retribution a - This point is flawed because I have already shown why there is no distinction. Furthermore, if you don't buy that argument, ex-felon is still a sub-category of a felon, thus can be an implied burden of the resolution. b - My opponent never warrants what he just said. However, lets go back to my point about proportionality. It would only be proportionate if it effected someones voting rights. For example, a felon commits insider trading, obviously this felony does not hurt anther's voting right, thus it is not proport9ioante to disenfranchise. c - My opponenet doesn't get my argument. I am saying that he dejustifies all punishment because all punishment treats someone else as a moral non-entity. Furthermore, my opponenet never warrants once in his case why ""moral non-entities exist"" and why it impacts a decision of the resolution. 2. Legal Consistency a - My opponent doesn't understand my argument. Even if it is 48/50 states, there still would be no legal consistency because all states have di8fferent disenfranchisement laws. [My case] Value: Democratic Society --> Basically my opponenet argues that his value is superior.

S8fa3a9aa-A8378374a	In a Democratic Society, Felons Ought to Retain the Right to Vote	"My opponent attempts to exclude the US from the resolution for various reasons. He contends the US cannot be a model of this situation because it does not allow all members of their society to vote. My response is that the resolution- ""In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote"" does not address children or ""all members of their society"". The resolution addresses felons, and whether or not they should ""retain"" the right to vote. In order for a felon to ""retain the right to vote"", he/she must first be eligible for the right to vote barring the fact they are a convicted felon. In other words a 16 year old (a child in the US) felon cannot retain the right to vote because he/she is not of legal voting age and therefore does not have the right to vote in the first place. Though my opponent implies that the affirmative must ""prove this in a society"", that is not the aim of the resolution. My premise is that in a democracy, felons should retain the right to vote- at least to some degree, and I used the US as an EXAMPLE of a democratic society which allows most felons to retain the right to vote. More examples are the individual 50 states which are also the individual democracies that regulate the right to vote for felons in different degrees. My opponent's contention that prison does not always rehabilitate has already been addressed. He gives the reader the illusion that I stated prison always rehabilitates, but I made no such statement or implication. I made it clear that my argument is for rehabilitated criminals, and that the goal of incarceration is rehabilitation, though it is up to the states (in the US) whether or not prisoners are rehabilitated to the point where they can benefit from the right to vote. My opponent next contends the US is not a democracy, and therefore his contention stands. However, the US is a ""democratic society"". Though the US is a Federal Republic, it is a democratic society because it is a Federation of Democratic States. The individual states do enjoy direct democracy, and it is the electoral process for the executive of the central government that does not qualify as a direct democracy. A Federal Republic, though not a direct democracy is a representative democracy (http://en.wikipedia.org...). If my opponent wishes to have a separate debate about political processes and what constitutes a democracy we may do so, but his attempt to nullify my arguments based on these objections is simply a clever way of not arguing the facts I presented in R1. My opponent's next response is a revision of his second contention. In response to his new revision, this is not a debate about consistency rather whether or not it ""should"" be that way. I gave the US as an example of not only why it ""should"" be that way, but that it ""is"" that way in the US, and it works. Again, my opponent attempts to turn this into an argument about semantics. I did not write the resolution, but I have made my position clear. Had my opponent really wanted to debate the topic he wouldn't have written the resolution in this manner, nor would he have made it clear in his opening argument that he would leave the door open for an argument on semantics should he not be able to address the facts. I gave 4 different examples of how the semantics can be applied, and how my argument is valid for all of them, though he implies I concentrated on only one. Again, we can have a separate debate on semantics, but the confusion is neither my doing, nor my aim, rather it is that of my opponent. I believe my opponent has failed to successfully answer my R1 arguments, and so it is virtually pointless to present new ones as he will probably just ignore them and attempt to argue the straw man again. Though I know the reader will have common sense, I urge you to re-read my R1 arguments after reading my R2 rebuttals. My opponent presented no new arguments in R2. Thank you."	PRO	27
S9762761d-Aa1d6768f	In a democractic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	"OVERVIEW: This guy forgets to argue the LENGTH of my arguments as badly as Brittney Spears forgets to wear her underwear. The framework from the very beginning of this debate that has gone cold-conceded, he offers no BRIGHTLINE as to what a ""just"" society is. Then he tries to frame his entire case around justice and a ""just society"" Since the resolution is framed under a predicated democracy, we must view this procedurally: there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected. He offers ABSOLUTELY NO BRIGHTLINE as to what is the universal concept of ""just"" or attaining justice is. This means that under the democratic framework, justice can never be attained. His definition of ""democracy"" indicates governed by the people. Inversely though—the majority of the people's decision or consensus is what determines a decision rather than whether it is ""just or not."" Even if I drop my whole case and run away, UNDER HIS OWN DEFINITIONAL/RESOLUTIONAL TERMS, JUSTICE CAN NEVER BE ACHIEVED UNDER CONSENSUS. HIS CASE: 1)""OBSERVATIONS"" (WHAT HE TRIES TO DO) a)He tries to extend his observation 1 about America, let him do that—it won't affect anything. All the arugments he tries to make about America is ""non resolutional"" or ""non-topical"", but I'll later prove that in this dsebate round. b)Don't let him get away with these scrawny, sneaky observation arguments put the gist of your ideals into the core of this debate round. c)Prefer my overview that goes 100% COLD-CONCEDED. FRAMEWORK SUBSUMES THE OBSERVATIONS 2)He tries to argue that FELONS won't be put into society all the time but this is flawed for FOUR REASONS a)Felons are the same products of the exfelons by timeframe b)Extend the TF argument that goes virtually cold-conceded. TF doesn't make or break the thematic concept of a felon from an ex-felon c)His definitional concept offers no brightline, don't let him bring up new clarifications in the last speech he should have done that from the very beginning d)All contentions and arguments are predicated off felons e)Reasonability checks 3)CONTENTION 1-RETRIBUTION a)He tries to post an argument that post res. Vs pre resolution is the equivalency of adults into babies however that's flawed for four reasons a.That is not what I'm saying, great job taking it out of context. The argument stands that FELONS are products of EXFELONS by the non-contributory TIMEFRAME which still puts them into the position of what the argument/resolution frames b.Felons and exfelons are products of each other, there's no reason to reject the arguments when they are FULLY PREDICATED OFF OF FELONS AND THEIR RIGHTS TO VOTE c.Inevitably put into same position—felons that are NOT put into society are given the net loss of basic rights (he concedes that in contention 2) meaning that they are THEMATICALLY the same position as an ex-felon by a matter of timeframe. Days and Months aren't going to change the ability to be more ""just"" d.Reasonability Checks. Observations check. Framework Checks 100 percent. b)He then goes on to state that the argument about how felons use the fact that there are different types of magnitudes of punishment in different societies as UNRESOLUTIONAL but that's not even WHAT THE ARGUMENT IS IMPLYING UNDER HIS OWN DEFINITIONAL TERMS. What societies come down to CAN BE IN AMERICA. Felon punishment laws and the different magnitudes are GROSSLY inconsistent. Felons use the fact that in one area of the United States, say for instance Texas, may punish less on one misconduct whereas New York on the otherhand, may consider that misconduct of greater magnitude of punishment. Flawed for two reasons a.It still subsumes a democratic framework. IT REFERS TO DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF PUNISHMENT UNDER THE SAME FRAMEWORK. b.The argument talks about different loopholes for different magnitudes of punishment c)He miserably tries to argue the argument about rape vs the government raping back as an ""I agree"" but HE ONCE AGAIN takes this poorly out of context. What the argument is saying is THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LIMIT to having the government do the same EXACT misconduct to the felon itself. The argument talked about the magnitude of punishments and instead, the government PUNISHES THE FELONS based on the magnitude of what they did… NOT BASED ON WHAT THEY DID. a.HE COLD CONCEDES Argument 3 and the following two subpoints. Extend that across. b.The subpoints are as follows: a) It assumes that all felons are convicted of crimes that need the magnitude of dehumanization AT EVERY SINGLE TYPE and b) there is one alternative or one type of punishment that is to be ultimately attained by these felons. THIS MEANS HE POORLY GENERALIZES THE MAGNITUDE OF EVERY MISCONDUCT. THERE ARE DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF MISCONDUCT EVEN WITH FELONS. 4)CONTENTION 2-LEGAL CONSISTENCY a.The only two spotty arguments he makes on this argument's flow is that THERE IS A CONSISTENT SYSTEM and that the felons have no right in the society BUT BOTH ARE POORLY TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT IN THE ARGUMENTATION. HE COLD CONCEDES POINTS 3-7. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. b.On argument subpoint 1, the argument is that the syntax of his contention concedes that the freeom to vote/speech is GREATER than that of basic rights. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A ""CONSISTENT SYSTEM"". This is about the different magnitudes of rights. Your contention clearly states ""other many basic rights are taken away""… ""why this"" The correlative comparisons indicate that BASIC RIGHTS are far more ""basic"" or less than that of freedom to vote/speech. This means this argument is wholly flawed for two reasons i.Out of context ii.The argument implies basic vs.greater magnitude as opposed to what you think c.On argument subpoint 2, the argument was that he concedes that BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TAKEN AWAY meaning that there is NET LOSS OF RIGHTS (regardless of its magnitudes) from the felons THAN THE LAW-ABIDIING CITIZEN. There is STILL A NET LOSS . He further helps to expound this argument by saying that they have no right… exactly, that is my argument. Essentially these felons have less rights in the end than a law-abiding citizen. d.On argument Subpoint 3, THIS GOES COLD CONCEDED. The argument talks about how, specifically within my first constructive, that TAKING AWAY THE FREEDOM TO VOTE/SPEECH (already conceded to be > basic rights) would be an additional, unnecessary punishment after the removal of the pre-requisites e.Subpoint 4=Cold conceded. Talks about how EVEN WITH REMOVAL of the freedom of speech/vote there is absolutely no deterrent f.The impact placed on Subpoint 5 THAT GOES COLD CONCEDED ONCE AGAIN is that when you take away this right to vote/speech, you make the right a reformed privilege to be granted by the only powerful meaning that it condones the tyrannistic autonomy by contention 2 talks about g.Subpoint 6 talks about how the syntax you place on your contentions are ""fair"" and ""basic"" both are assumed VALUES that have no brightline in the democratic society. Refer to my overview if you're lost. h.Cross Apply democracy- democracy indicates rulings REGARDLESS of how basic, fair, it is in your eyes. 5)CONTENTION 3-DOUBLE STANDARD a.Once again, very spotty flow. The only three arguments he make are once again taken out of context. He cold concedes many subpoints. Let's take a closer look b.Subpoint A indicates the Turn: That you condone a tyrannistic autonomy by making the right to vote a reformed privilege against the already taken away prerequisites. You go on to say the 98% vs 2% against the people however this is flawed for two main reasons. i.There are no warrants to these 2 numbers ii.The argument was specific to the imposition of character requirements on voting that endlessly and doomlessly turn into a right only to be given to the ""privileged"" c.Subpoint B indicates that JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NO AGREEMENT WITH THE NEGATIVE OPTION DOESN'T MEAN I CONDONE"	PRO	28
S7da97fb8-A4b7f95a7	R: Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"We live in a society that accepts the notion of unalienable rights. As a society we accept that the main duty of a government is to secure such rights. Such a government receives their power from the consent of the governed. In our society this is done through voting. Ground work: Unalienable Rights “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” (Declaration of Independence) Unalienable: “impossible to take away or give up” (1) We live in a society that accepts the concept that some rights are unalienable. The Duty of Government “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men” (Declaration of Independence) “Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority;” (2) We live in a society that requires of its government the protection and security of such rights. The Power of the People “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed”(Declaration of Independence) “Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law.”(2) We live in a society that dictates that the power of government come from the consent of the governed Via voting. ""A man without a vote is a man without protection."" Lyndon B. Johnson 36th U.S. President (3) ""Voting is the most precious right of every citizen"" Hillary Clinton (4) The whole picture We live in a society that accepts… 1: All people born equal with rights 2: Government’s function is to secure unalienable rights 3: Government receives power through the consent of the governed via voting Contention: Harm and Solvency. As shown in round 1 the status quo removes the right to vote from many felons. Eric H. Holder, JD, US Attorney General, stated the following in his Feb. 11, 2014 speech. “In many states, felony disenfranchisement laws are still on the books. And the current scope of these policies is not only too significant to ignore – it is also too unjust to tolerate… Across this country today, an estimated 5.8 million Americans – 5. 8 million of our fellow citizens – are prohibited from voting because of current or previous felony convictions. That’s more than the individual populations of 31 U.S. states. And although well over a century has passed since post- Reconstruction states used these measures to strip African Americans of their most fundamental rights, the impact of felony disenfranchisement on modern communities of color remains both disproportionate and unacceptable… … It is unwise, it is unjust, and it is not in keeping with our democratic values.” (5) The harm of the status quo is clear. It is unjust, it affects millions of Americans, it is contrary to societies values, and undermines the role of government. As Eric Holder concludes, “These laws deserve to be not only reconsidered, but repealed.” (5) Through repeal of laws that remove the right to vote we can eliminate all harms associated with them. Conclusion: 1: Government cannot receive legitimate power through consent of the governed if the governed cannot vote. 2: Without consent or power the government cannot secure unalienable rights “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed”( Declaration of Independence) If the right to vote is taken away, our entire system of government cannot live up to its primary purpose.

S826727bc-Aaa4cb5cc	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"You say ""when a crime is committed that action should be taken to preserve the liberty of others"" and ask ""How does taking a Felon""s right to vote protect other""s freedom?"" Because voting is a civic duty necessary for a healthy society and criminals are anti-social with little care for civility. If you prove yourself to be uncivilized and anti-social to the extent that you need to be caged like a wild animal you have proved that your opinion regarding the welfare of society is malignant. ""I may not agree with what you have to say but I will fight to the death for your right to say it"" One of my favorite quotes. Beautiful. I never thought I would have to explain that malignant speech is crime. You are not allowed to say ""Go Loot Ferguson"". These exemptions are obvious just as offenders of human rights with good reason get taken out of society and out of the process of governance. Yes I said ...""We have Zero Representation because our ratio of representative to constituent is a million to one. That ridiculous ratio does not make a ""Representative Democracy""...but I must not be very clear you failed to understand my point. My point is that congress is not measurably a democracy. You want an entity that is not a democracy to decide who governs my child's future. You want this non democratic body to give nefarious people power to make decisions on how this nation will be structured to receive my children as they transform into adults. I want the best for all of our children. Whereas you and a Non-democratic institution wish to give nefarious people, people so terrible that they would injure and or kill our children to serve their selfish depravity,you would give them a part in deciding the path of our children's lives. If you are in favor of Democracy you will leave these decisions to the states as prescribed in the constitution. You complain that minorities are disproportionately affected. I agree that is a problem but the problem is for another debate. That debate is about the failed war on drugs and the failed war on poverty. Two wars that have terrible effects on minorities. I support pragmatic solution on this problem as a Libertarian. Funny how it is that the politicians elected by minorities vote in the halls of Congress to continue these ill gotten wars. Many minorities suffer the violence of arrest and imprisonment for things that sensible men would not consider a crime. Democrats could fix that problem overnight."	CON	30
S8fdf3c42-A91a83d51	In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	I will defend my own case, then move on to attack my opponents --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NC Observation 2) UN/felon and ex-felon --> OK, if you used my opponents logic then the UN database would barely consist of any words due to the fact that very little is shared by all nations. For example, the UN defines communism. Most nations are not communistic, but the UN still defines it. Same here. Although some nations do not differenciate between a felony and misdeamenor, the UN still defines it. Retain --> I am not making the resolution categorically false, because my opponent is changing the wording of the resolution with his false (and probably made up) definition. My definition is not inferior, because a definition (my opponents) that is made up is not superior to anything Value: Justice --> yeah, he kind of just gave up on his democratic society value. Hopefully you, the voting panel, will catch that VC: Maximization of Fairness --> he says I never defined fairness (sorry, common sense implied), so I accept your view of fairness. But this is why it is wrong. Notice, how my opponent says 'everyone' and 'maximizing the right to vote'. Okay, giving some child in Africa the right to vote would be giving 'equal rights to all' and 'maximizing the right to vote'. So, as you can see, this does not uphold justice and fairness to the people here. Cont: 1--> Retribution --> If ex-felon is a sub-category(under) of a felon, then felon is a superior category of an ex-felon, My opponent openly aknowledges the fact that his whole case is built upon ex-felons, which, according to him, is inferior on a resolutional scale to that of a felon. --> Okay, so now my opponent is saying you can only punish that which the felon violated. Let's take insider trading, shall we? Insider Trading does not violate anybody's pursuit of hapiness, yet, society puts them in jail which inherently violates their pursuit of hapiness. If you agree with my opponent, then you must rape rapists and asssault assaulters or just not punish them altogethher, neither of which would not uphold justice Cont: 2--> Legal Consistency --> states do not have different disenfranchisement laws through incarceration (outside the two that I argue should) You either retain your right to vote (which only 4% of states do, and I argue that they should do not) or you lose it (which they should) Cont: 3--> Double Standard --> my opponent did not attack this contention, therefore it can be extended through to the final round. My opponent is dropping more and more of my arguments [Rebuttal] Value: Democratic Society --> He concedes that my value is superior. End of Story VC: Maximizing Participation --> he does not defend my attacks on his VC. Therefore, you can extend to the final round. Cont: 1--> Contesting Views --> My opponent says that I did not understand my argument, so, therefore, as long as I prove that my first rebuttal was pertaining to his case, my attack stands through to the final round (he did not say 'well even if it was about my case, this is why it is wrong...') --> My opponent says 'basically, it oppresses other peoples views'. So, by oppressing you or your views, I treat you as less than a normal citizen, ergo treating them as second class citizens. Just for review, I will list THREE reasons that this is false --> 1) Becoming a second-class citizen means losing some rights. If felons did not lose any rights in jail, then punishment could not exist. He is dejustifying ALL punishment 2) Felons have brought this on themselves. By committing a felony, they treat their victim as a second class citizen 3) (TURN) This goes against my opponent observastion of felons being felons for life. If we are not to make them into second class upon re-entry, then we would not be treating them as felons for life. My opponent has an option: Drop this contention (his only one) or drop his felon-exfelon observations. They cannot coincide with each other [Chrystallize] --> His value is noy only inferior to that of mine, but he openly aknowledges that it is as well. His whole case is based on democracy (democratic society), so proving his value inferior should destroy the rest of his case, as well as my attacks on them --> His value criteria attack was dropped, and cannot be defended in the last rebuttal. He realizes that my criteria better upholds the value of justice --> I attacked all of his contentions (only one) and observations (only one).	CON	31
Sb20f758c-A681b9b5e	In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote	"Felons are as culpable for their actions as they are as culpable for their mistreatment"" Value: I accept the value for this debate as Justice Value Criterion: Retribution will be my value criterion for this debate. In order for justice to be maintained, some form of retribution must be applied for society to fall into order. Whenever an individual acts in an unlawful way, actions must be taken to balance out the spectrum in order to maintain justice. Contentions: 1. Maintaining order In order to maintain order, some action must be done to balance out the unlawful actions that have taken place. Without some form of retribution, society would be essentially condoning felony. Our nation would devolve into chaos and despair, something as a society we are morally obliged to avoid. 2. Social Contract The social contract, stated by John Locke, states that the people forfeit some rights to government in order to secure more rights. It also states that when an individual violates the rights of others within this government, it is the peoples and government's responsibility to act against said individual. One right violation (that of life, which is needed to utilize all other rights) allows another right violation (disenfranchisement) to exist. This retribution is needed in order to sustain order. Now I will rebut my opponent's case. Value: I have accepted his value Criterion: The preservation of Democracy does not maintain proper justice. Some action needs to be taken in order to insure that the actions of the felon are not condoned by society. 1st Contention: Racism does not exist in government. Racism does not exist, because the term in itself is a contradiction to reality and itself. The term is a contradiction to itself because by calling another person racist, you are in a sense racist yourself, unless you abide by the double standard that is held upon whites in America, in which every race beside Caucasian is allowed to utilize the ""race card"". The term also is a contradiction to reality because humans, by nature, are designed and tend to form into groups. This forces generalizations to be applied, so calling someone a racist for applying generalizations is against humanity. The reason that most felons are black is the same reason that most criminals are black. This does not in any way make the act of disenfranchisement immoral or unjust. 2nd Contention: The United Nations does not hold any ruling or reign over America. We are a sovereign nation and should focus on how this affects America domestically, because other nations are in a completely different status quo. The act of disenfranchisement does not restrict the democratic process because the lack of a felon vote is negligible on society, and they also still do not deserve a vote. 3rd Contention: Again, this issue has no pertinence to other countries because, for one, this resolution is based on purely a democratic society, and two, their status quo differs from ours. Conclusion: Because re-enfranchising criminals would be unjust and would not fair well for a society as a whole, felons should stripped of the right to vote."	CON	32

Also, you can ignore my opponents continuation of his argument on the comment section, for that his obviously against the rules and for good reason [My case-Observations] Observation I: America --> he accepted it, end of story Observation II: Felons/ Ex-felons Pretty much, my opponent argues that felons are put back into society, and therefore I have to extend this to felons that are in society --> Upon re-entry into society, felons are no longer considered a felon by society. If society still recognized them as a felon, they would still be in jail serving their felony. Because society has realized that their debt was paid off, they are now considered an ex-felon --> Because ex-felons are not implied by the resolution, anything pertaining to an ex-felon is inherently unresolutional [My case-Contentions] Contention I: Retribution My opponent argues my whole contention because I made an argument on how he was implying things that were not relevant to the resolution --> My opponent says that we have to look to the time frame from when felons get out. This is wrong because you are inferring something that is not implied by the resolution. For example, he says that all felons are eventually released (which I proved wrong; capital punishment, death in prison, life in jail, etc.) But, because he is looking post-resolution, why can't you look pre-resolution? I was simply using my opponents logic against him. If he is going to infer thinks that are not implied, I then am able to infer things that are not implied. Pre-resolution means giving babies the right to vote, which, in my opinion, is extremely dangerous and jeopardizes the whole democracy Contention II: Legal Consistency He argues that we do not have a legal system and that I value the right to vote over basic rights. --> The whole point of my argument was the fact that we do not have a legally consistent system, and that we must strive towards one, which include disenfranchisement during incarceration --> I do not value the right to vote over the right to speech. All positive rights are equal. I say that for a neutral arbiter to uphold standard principles of fairness to its constituents, the government must take away the right to vote because more intrinsic rights are withheld through incarceration Contention III: Double Standard My opponent says that I am 'turning the right to vote into a privilege' --> This is wrong. I, more than my opponent, value the right to vote. It is exactly why I value it that I take it away from undeserving people. By rewarding political rights and say in the government in incarceration, my opponent is condoning violent acts and setting a double standard to that of law-abiding citizens by making the law-breakers into the law-makers [My case-Value/Value Criteria] Value: Justice --> my opponent failed to attack my value, and so it can thus be extended Value Criteria: Maximization of Fairness --> Once again, he dropped his attack on my VC [His Case- Observations, Contentions, Value, Value Criterion] --> he dropped ALL of them.

All my arguments from the previous post are therefore extended [Voting Issues] (1) My opponent dropped his attack on my first observation, my value premise, and my value criteria (2) I defended my second observation and my contentions above (3) He dropped his WHOLE CASE on the last rebuttal.

My opponent believes that prison always rehabilitates however, there are always circumstances of this not being true. My opponent's rebuttle to my first contention just soley address the U.S. system; which is inconsisnent because the U.S. is not a true democracy so my first contention stands. My opponent's rebuttle to my second contention does not realize that my second contention simply states that the Affirmative must prove this consistent in all societies, while he only sticks to the U.S., which is not a pure democratic society.

Sb20f758c-A669484ca	In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote	"Sorry for not posting in round two... I had the flu... I will begin by first rebuilding the Affirmative case and then attacking the Negative case. Criterion: the Idea of preservation of Democracy s the most valid for purpose of this debate because the highest form of justice that can be achieved in a democratic society is the preservation of that society. Also in order to pass a just law it must work towards the betterment of society and that is essentially preservation of society and in a democracy the society is democratic then we must preserve democracy. 1st contention I will point out once again the Exoneration rate. over 70% of all Exonerated felons are Black. Also the arrest rate is 8.2 times higher. this points to a racially prejudice judiciary that would wrongfully disenfranchise a race of people, which would go against every democratic code in this country. 2nd contention Again the resolution states ""in a democratic society"" we are not the only democratic society so UN proclamations must be considered. Also we are a signatory member of these documents acknowledging there legality in this country. Humans are rational beings and therfore capable of rational though. as the Negative has shown to evidence to support there idea the point is invalidated. 3rd contention The resolution states democratic society so other countries are applicable. invalidating the negative point and allowing the contention to stand. Now I will attack the Negative case. Criterion: The stated negative criterion is of retribution is invalid as it does not fulfill justice. The idea of retribution is the classic eye for an eye principle. however in this case even that principle is invalid. How does a idea of disenfranchisement for possession of drugs promote justice? It doesn't not even by the negative standards, Because there is no way the punishment for drug addiction, a disease of sorts, can be punishable by denying the right to participate in society. as I stated in my opening quote ""felons have fully payed their debt to society"" so the idea of further retribution hinders the rehabilitation process. 1st contention. The form of retribution is the prison sentence and because they have already payed thier debt to society no more retribution is needed. So we would not be condoning felony we would simply be protecting the rights of all citizens. The exclusion of one group because of how they would vote is an unjust and unlawful practice proving this contention invalid. 2nd contention In this contention the negative seems to assume that felns always violate the right to life, this is not the case. A felon convicted of drug use is not harming any other person. Also a habitual drug user has a sort of disease from continued use and cannot be punished for his disease. So the Negative advocates and unequal system of retribution that punishes more severely than the measure of the crime. Primary Voting Issues... Criterion of Preservation of democracy--I have proved that this is the superior voting criterion and therefore we must adhere to it Impact of Democracy--As I have proved disenfranchisement has a lagre negative effect of democracy which does not fulfill the criterion and therefore does not promote justice.

S826727bc-A1898ff1	Felons should have voting rights in the modern U.S.	"I can hardly believe anyone would make the argument that they would want violent psychopaths and organized crime members to be casting votes from inside of the penitentiary. If I lived in a community that had a prison inside its borders I would be very upset if the federal government forced us to allow these prisoners to vote for our town council, Mayor, School board etc... Once again leave communities to make these decisions. I can accept what you and your peers want. I can not accept you meddling in my community and forcing us to bend to your totalitarian will. Mind your own business. Not every community will have the same wants as yours. The Declaration of Independence is not a carefully thought out law but a cry for freedom from an oppressive centralized government. Your proposal here is to have a centralized government make a law to force states to act against our own will. Laws are violent things. They are enforced in brutal ways. Just ask Eric Garner. He was arrested on suspicion of breaking law implemented by progressives. You also propose to have this law implemented and enforced by a centralized government with almost zero representation. I can say ""Zero Representation"" because cause a ratio of representative to constituent is a million to one. That ridiculous ratio does not make a ""Representative Democracy"". We designate an act a crime because it is injurious to public welfare. If you look at all such crimes you will find that someone is a victim and that victim has been deprived of their Human Rights. Their right to pursue life liberty and happiness. I see no problem in denying these offensive criminal their rights. We deny inside traders access to the markets. Child molesters are denied privacy. Computer criminals are denied the use of the Internet. All are denied the use of weapons for self-defense. These decisions, as clearly prescribed in The Constitution of the United States of America, are left to the states. You ask ""What happens when we take away the right to vote?""

S8fdf3c42-A2fc45eba	In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote	Since I'll try to make this debate as close to LD as possible, I'll go straight to voting issues. There are 3 reasons why you should vote Affirmative/Pro: First, the values based debate. The Affirmative upholds both structures. Looking at my opponents structure. The Affirmative better achieves justice for a simple reason. He never defines what justice is so you can look at my Rawlsian definition which is maximizing rights. I better achieve his VC because the only way to maximize fairness is when fairness is due. Once a felon returns to society, they ought to regain their right to vote because it is fair. Now, lets look to my value structure. My value of a democratic society is better achieved on my side because of my VC. To better achieve a dem. society is through maximizing participation which is clearly done by the affirmative. Second, since the meaning and context of my Contention I was never refuted gives clear evidence for a aff. vote. Why? Simple. It is directly inherent to the resolution because the resolution implies democratic ideals. Democratic ideals are built on the idea of contesting values within society. Third, my opponents case never negates the resolution because the obligation of the neg is not to prove the resolution categorically false, as he was trying to do, but prove the resolution within the affirmative context untrue. Since he does not do this at all, i.e. he never proves why felons who return to society ought to retain the right to vote, you cannot negate because he has not proved the resolution untrue within an affirmative contextual world. For these reasons you can affirm.	PRO	39
Sb20f758c-A7ed7410e	In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote	"I will begin by attacking my opponent's case. Value: Both parties have agreed to justice as the accepted value for this debate. Criterion: Although I agree that for a democratic society to exist we must preserve it, that does not in any way make his criterion superior to my own. In order to preserve democracy certain actions must be taken. These actions would fall under my criterion, retribution, and thus makes my criterion superior to my opponents. 1st Contention: Racism First of all, America should not be discussed in a societal debate. But even then, there is no correlation between the exoneration demographics and racism. The only obvious correlation I see is that more black people commit crimes than white people, and because there is a smaller black population in America the per capita arrest rate is much, much higher than the white people's respective arrest rate. 2nd Contention: UN's Advice Again, the UN has no pertinence to a societal debate, but even then I will still rebut your claim. America is an independent sovereign nation, and as such should look within for governmental advice rather than to others. Other nations inherently want to claim superiority over us, so taking there advice would be detrimental to our nation as a whole. However, even if we were to listen to the UN, we must realize that they pose an ideal system. Ideally, rehabilitation should be valued over retribution. But because rehabilitation is impossible with humanity because of human nature, we must dismiss it as a possible course of action. 3rd Contention: If everyone else is doing it, we should too Again, temporal affairs should not be discussed in a societal debate, but I will still rebut your claim. As a society, it is the government's responsibility to uphold justice. In order for this to occur, certain actions must be taken. If a criminal is given the right to vote, it speaks poorly of our society's ability to govern. Of course all citizens of a democratic society should be given the right to vote and participate in said government. But if one infringes on another's rights, then we must take proper action. For instance, in a democratic society, one should be able to do anything. But then chaos would erupt. So we decide that one can do anything as long as it doesn't infringe on another's right to do anything. So, a felon is someone who has violated another's right, why should he be able to participate in the society he clearly disobeyed and disrespected? Now I will defend my own case. Criterion: Retribution does form justice and order within a society. Retribution can be any action to balance another action. For instance, if one steals a car, we do not steal his car to fulfill our society's burden, we simply incarcerate him for a certain amount of time. The eye for an eye philosophy is actually extremely important for a society to uphold justice. Without retribution, nothing would deter crime. I could simply kill you, because my rights would not be jeopardized in the process. Fear is the best deterrent, and so retribution is necessary to uphold justice, which would in turn preserve democracy. 1st Contention: Maintaining order Please do not bring your treason to this debate. The government is clearly not racist, and I am tired of talking about it at this point in the debate. The act of temporary imprisonment is just that, temporary. If I told you that if you stole 500 dollars out of my wallet, I would force you into time out for 5 minutes, would you try and take the money? What if I was gone and there was little chance you would be caught? Now ask yourself the same questions if the punishment was 5 minutes in time out and you were not allowed to own a house for the rest of your life. You could substitute nearly any action into phrase ""own a house"" and the fact that that action lasts a lifetime makes it an enormous burden. So, the act of permanent disenfranchisement actually does deter crime. 2nd Contention: Social Contract Although I use the act of murder as an example, it is not the only criminal action that constitutes the removal of one's rights. In fact, just by the word criminal the action is already known to violate another's rights. Drug use may seem like a ""victimless"" offense, but several people are being hurt. You are becoming useless to society as you will not be able to function normally. Also, your friends and family will be devastated, and any immediate family or spouses will reap the financial detriments that are soon to follow with drug addiction. Also, violating any law is against the overall preservation of a democratic society as people directly or indirectly voted those laws into existence. By violating society, your own rights should be respectively violated. Voting Issues: 1. I have proven that my criterion (Retribution) is superior to my opponent's criterion (Preservation of Democracy) because retribution is needed to insure the preservation of democracy. 2. My criterion better supports the accepted value of justice. 3. His ENTIRE case is based on temporal affairs, which should be dismissed in a societal debate. 4. Rehabilitation is inherently inferior to retribution as rehabilitation is inherently impossible to utilize within a society. 5. Every action requires a counter action for order to be maintained, which is the highest goal of society."	CON	40

S7581a608-A46533e85	Ex-Cons should not be denined the vote.	"In this second round, my opponent has presented the following: 1. That permanent disenfranchisement is unconstitutional, 2. The question of whether society can ""dictate the rights a person enjoys,"" and 3. The notion that continued disenfranchisement encourages ex-convicts to ""remain on the fringes of society as second-class citizens,"" followed again by the assertion that ""indefinite punishment"" of this nature is unconstitutional. First, we should note that whether or not my opponent realizes it, the question of permanent or ""indefinite"" disenfranchisement is a red herring. Only three states currently have ""permanent"" disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and again even in those cases the ex-con retains the ability to recover the right to vote through petitioning the court, if they so choose. In all other states, the right to vote is returned to the ex-convict, typically automatically after a certain period of time has elapsed since completion of the sentence. However, even if the disenfranchisement were permanent in all states, it would definitely not be unconstitutional. As was noted in round 1, the Fourteenth Amendment clearly recognizes the rights of the states to deny convicted criminals the right to vote, implictly in the first section and explicitly in the second. Section 2 of this amendment was, in fact, the basis for the 1974 Supreme Court ruling in the case Richardson v. Ramirez, which dealt with precisely this issue. (The full text of the ruling may be found at http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu... The Fourteenth Amendment is widely recognized as affirming the constitutionality of state disenfranchisement laws by legal scholars across the nation; for example, the following comments from an article by Edward B. Foley, the Director of Election Law @ Moritz, and Douglas Dumolt, Class of 2006, Moritz School of Law at the Ohio State University: ""This understanding also dovetailed with the U.S. Constitution's explicit recognition, in section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, that states are permitted to disenfranchise felons if they wish."" So it seems very clear - from opinions from the legal community, from simply reading the text of the 14th Amendment, and most importantly a Supreme Court ruling on this very question - that disenfranchisement laws ARE definitely constitutional. And note that there is no distinction in these opinions and rulings between those laws which ""automatically"" return the vote to the ex-convict, and those which my opponent would label as ""permanent."" So we now come to the ""moral"" question - can society ""morally"" deny any individual certain rights? We should recognize first that, in any practical sense, ""rights"" under the law derive solely from the so-called ""contract with society"" that each of us, as the members of that society, implicitly agree to. It certainly makes for good political rhetoric to speak of ""inherent"" and ""inalienable"" rights, but in practice we enjoy only those rights which society as a whole has agreed to defend on behalf of the individual. If you disagree, may I suggest that you visit any of a number of the other societies on Earth where certain of the rights we enjoy here are not so well-defended, and attempt to exercise them. In what sense of the word would, say, an individual living in Stalin's Soviet Union enjoy an ""inalienable"" right to free speech? So rights DO derive, in any practical sense, from the ""contract with society."" And here is a case where we are discussing the ""rights"" of individuals who have already, of their own free will, broken that contract by committing acts against other members of the society or the society as a whole. Rather than being concerned about the ""morality"" of denying certain rights to these individuals, should we not first discuss the morality of continuing to let them participate in the running of that society, given that they have already demonstrated their unwillingness to behave in that society's best interests? Society clearly has both the legal and the moral right - and in fact, the obligation - to disenfranchise convicted criminals, both as part of the punishment for their crimes and to protect itself from the potential consequences of permitting them to participate in the voting process. At the very least, this must be done until these individuals have demonstrated their willingness and ability to now ""play by the rules"" - and as was already noted, they have a path to recover their voting rights in each and every state of the union. Since the disenfranchisement is rarely ""permanent"" - and when it is, it is generally through the individual's inability to demonstrate that they ARE ready to again participate as full members of society - the question of this practice pushing these people to the ""fringes of society"" or making them ""second-class citizens"" is moot. If they are remaining on the ""fringes,"" it is by their own choice - just as it was their choice to commit the crime which resulted in their disenfranchisment in the first place. Rights do not exist apart from responsibilities, and we are most definitely not talking about a case of the ""big bad government"" unfairly or unconstitutionally restricting the rights of some poor, innocent citizens. If you cannot live up to the responsibilities of citizenship, and you demonstrate this by committing criminal acts, then you shouldn't be surprised if certain of your ""rights"" are restricted or lost. This is in part to punish the criminal for their acts, but equally importantly it is to protect society from those who have clearly demonstrated inability or unwillingness to respect the rest of the society's members."

S7581a608-A9319da62	Ex-Cons should not be denined the vote.	"At this point, my opponent appears to have backed away from his original argument - that ex-cons should not be denied the vote (with no further qualifications on that), to expressing concern mostly about ""permanent"" disenfranchisement. He notes in his most recent argument: ""For the record I support harsher punishment for crime. However, extending punishment beyond the sentence and probation to the point of potentially depriving a right for life does not have sufficient moral or constitutional justification in a free society."" and ""My opponent also contends that permanent disenfranchisement is the solution to prevent criminal influence in our elections."" First of all, I said no such thing; I have not been arguing at all for ""permanent"" disenfranchisement, nor stated it as a ""solution to prevent criminal influence in our elections."" As I have pointed out consistently throughout this debate, the notion of ""permanent"" disenfranchisement is a red herring, a straw man. Even my opponent acknowledges that only three states still have disenfranchisement laws without a specific period after which the voting rights are automatically restored, and even in those three states (which together represent a mere 4.9% of the population of the U.S.), the franchise can be and often IS restored upon petition to the courts. It is certainly not unreasonable that the state require an individual who has in the past been convicted of major crimes to demonstrate a willingness to ""play by the rules"" before returning voting rights to them. And there's no need for ""51% of the population to be ex-cons"" in order for the state to have legitimate concerns about granting these people the right to vote; that is simply hyperbole on the part of my opponent. The question is whether or not they would constitute a sufficiently large voting block so as to affect the margin in a given vote, and whether or not an individual who has already demonstrated an unwillingness to act in the interests of society should be granted a role in running that society. The constitutionality of disenfranchisement laws is not at all in serious question, the opinions of a few fringe legal scholars notwithstanding. The important factor here is the existence of a very clear-cut Supreme Court decision on this very issue, and for those who wish to know the specifics of that opinion - which DID take into careful account the intent of the writers of the 14th Amendment - a link to the full text of that decision has already been provided. Whether my opponent likes it or not, disenfranchisement HAS been determined to be constituional, and a valid part of the law of the land. With that said, I believe there is little additional ground that needs to be covered. It has been shown that denying the vote, temporarily, to convicted criminals is constituional, is in the interests of our society, and is rarely if ever truly ""permanent"" - and so hardly constitutes an undue burden on the population of ex-criminals. Again, if the right to vote was that valuable to them in the first place, they should not have made the CHOICE to violate the law. People who do this ARE criminals - we are not talking about taking away the rights of innocents here - and chose to follow a criminal path knowing full well the potential consequences of that choice. We need not have too much sympathy for them if they complain about those consequences afterwards."	CON	47
S7581a608-A52418c8a	Ex-Cons should not be denined the vote.	"First, it should be readily apparent that denying a convicted felon the right to vote is NOT unconstitutional; my opponent has already (and apparently without realizing it) quoted the very text from the Constitution which shows this. Repeating that quotation - the 14th Amendment - here, with the relevant text highlighted: ""Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Carefully note that phrase, ""without due process of law."" The rights enumerated in the Constitution, and specifically in the Bill of Rights, are not and never were intended to be absolute and inviolable. The fact that we imprison people in the first place (a clear violation of the ""right to liberty,"" if that right were to be considered ""absolute""), and that such imprisonment and other punishments were clearly and explicitly anticipated by the Constitution, shows this. The States can, through the due process of law, deny various rights as punishment for infractions of the law. But why deny voting rights to convicted criminals? First, this is clearly a part of the punishment prescribed for various crimes (in general, that class of crimes that we call felonies). You know going in that if you commit certain criminal acts, and are convicted of them, that you are going to be stripped of certain rights that otherwise would be yours as a citizen. In short, this is your choice - and if you value your right to vote, it is an additional incentive not to commit the crime in the first place. And from society's perspective, this makes sense. We do not grant the right to participate in government, through voting, to just anyone. You must be of a certain age, and in general you must be of reasonably sound mind. But a convicted criminal has already demonstrated one major shortcoming regarding a quality that any reasonable society should expect of its voters. Simply put, in committing a crime, you are demonstrating that you are NOT willing to abide by your society's laws in the first place - should you then expect to have a hand in the making of those laws? Our system of voting rights is based on the assumption that voters will have an interest in promoting the good of the society as a whole - why should we grant voting right to those who have demonstrated the exact opposite? It might be claimed that the permanent loss of the right to vote constitutes an unusual and extreme punishment, one which is not warranted in many cases. That's fine, and the law already provides a means through which it may be addressed. The ex-convict retains the right to petition the State, through legal channels, for their right to vote to be returned. In many states, the right to vote is automatically restored after a specified time period following completion of the convict's sentence, assuming of course that no further crime has been committed by the individual during that period. Given, then, that the franchise IS very commonly restored to ex-convicts - especially if it is important enough to them that they pursue it - what justification can there be for eliminating this part of the punishment for such demonstrably anti-social individuals?"	CON	48
S7581a608-Aef6cbd5e	Ex-Cons should not be denined the vote.	"My opponent is quite correct in his analysis of due process of law. Rights and privileges of citizenship can be TEMPORARILY suspended for an infraction against the law. However, to suspend rights PERMINENTLY with the only recourse being to petition the state for reinstatement of these rights is unconstitutional. ""Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. NO STATE SHALL MAKE OR ENFORCE ANY LAW WHICH SHALL ABRIDGE THE PRIVLAGES OR IMMUNITEIS OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; NOR DENY TO ANY PERSON WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS."" These laws do indeed deny the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. Forcing a citizen to petition the government for the restoration of a basic right after punishment has been served does abridge a privilege of citizenship. Any person, not only citizens, enjoy equal protection of the laws in the United States. A former felon is hardly receiving the equal protection of the laws after the right to vote has been taken away. In a legal sense my objection to legislation denying the right to vote to former convicts is the lack of specified duration of punishment. Actions such as this start down the path of life-long punishment for a lesser crime than serious felonies or capital crimes, which carry a justifiable and constitutional punishment of specific length. The moral question I ask is can society dictate what rights a person enjoys? Only when the exercise of your rights impeded another's can society step in and punish you for that infraction. Every legal adult is in a contract with society as a whole. Abuse of another person's rights results in punishment. After this punishment has been completed what justification is there for a continuation of the punishment in the form of disenfranchisement? By continuing the punishment of these individual through disenfranchisement we are only encouraging them to remain on the fringes of society as second-class citizens. Criminals need to be punished, in my opinion often more severely than we do now, but indefinite punishment to be lifted at the discretion of the government is not only unconstitutional but poses the risk of creating a class of subjects, not citizens."

The Supreme Court case that my opponent mentions is Richardson v. Ramirez. This is a case originating in California, which specified that convict shall have their right to vote restored by the court after the service of probation. This is hardly permanent disenfranchisement. The case dealt simply with the constitutionality of the statute at hand, one that dealt with temporary disenfranchisement. I refute my opponent's claim that ""The Fourteenth Amendment is widely recognized as affirming the constitutionality of state disenfranchisement laws by legal scholars across the nation..."" Gabriel L. Chin of the University of Arizona Law School agrees that a reassement of the 2nd section of the 14th Amendment is in order and is also of dubious constitutionality due to that particular section's involvement with Reconstruction after the Civil War. The 14th Amendment deals specifically with ""rebellion, and other crimes"", considering rebellion can only be committed against the Federal government due to the position of sovereignty ""other crimes"" can be argued to be applicable to the Federal government versus the states. As a citation: Chin, Gabriel J., ""Reconstruction, Felon Disenfranchisement and the Right to Vote: Did the Fifteenth Amendment Repeal Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment?"" . Georgetown Law Journal, Vol. 92, p. 259, 2004 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com... or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.433580 I would disagree with my opponent on the concept that the individual rights derive from the contract with society. All persons have the right to exercise these rights until they interfere with the rights of others. At this point the contract is broken and the violator in question is punished on the basis of breaking this contract. Your rights cannot be protected while you infringe on the rights of others. However, after your punishment is served society is not holding up it's part of the bargain if your full rights are not restored. My opponent also contends that permanent disenfranchisement is the solution to prevent criminal influence in our elections. First, ex -cons do not make up 51% of the population. The ""potential consequences of permitting them to participate in the voting process"" are going to be exactly what. In that states that do not disenfranchise ex-cons or have limited disenfranchisement I have not seen any evidence of a criminal take over of the government. My opponent and I agree on many issues. For the record I support harsher punishment for crime. However, extending punishment beyond the sentence and probation to the point of potentially depriving a right for life does not have sufficient moral or constitutional justification in a free society. A free society must protect those rights which make it free. While free speech and freedom of religion are certainly fundamental how can the citizens of any democracy secure these rights without the right to vote? Participation in government is a fundamental guarantee of the Constitution. To abridge this right on the basis of a previous condition is not consistent with the tradition of rights we hold so dearly in this nation. Thank you sir for this debate!
