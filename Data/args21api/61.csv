S7ae7b591-A932862f3	Wind energy provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear power	No renewable energy is going to provide the sheer quantity and variety of energy needed to power a developed society. Wind suffers from being unreliable – producing either too little or too much – and as a result would be a bad choice to be the core technology. The basic staple of the energy supply needs to be predictable as well as clean. Wind may well have a useful role providing a surplus that can be tapped in to at times of high demand. However, it is simply not reliable enough to be the mainstay of the energy blend. It is worth noting that wind energy requires government subsidies which is simply not viable in the long term, people are unlikely to be keen on the idea of paying for their energy twice; once through their power bill and then again in their taxes[i].

S7ae7b591-A671ee205	Wind energy provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear power	There is little doubt that the current mix of energy provision is simply unsustainable. Fossil fuels are simply too damaging to the environment and nuclear is just too expensive. Wind power is an established technology providing, for example, 21% of electricity in Denmark.[i] The research is already done and can be made available around the world. Once externalities are taken into account nuclear energy is the single most expensive way of producing a therm. Clean coal is, frankly, a myth and the trend for oil and gas is constantly upwards in term of price. Other renewables are embryonic technologies fraught with development costs whereas wind is an established technology already providing a significant share of the energy mix in several developed economies.

S6140b8cc-Aa3dce0f4	Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)	Pro did present some opening arguments, but then followed up with four forfeits. I refuted his arguments in the second and third rounds, to which Pro did not respond. Micropower requires a power grid to back up unreliable alternative energy sources like wind and solar. There is nothing remotely economical that operates independently of the grid. The government program contains only a small amount of money for micropower and does nothing to make alternative energy cheaper or more reliable. The best application of micropower is with small gas turbine generators, a technology that industry has fully developed and now widely supports. Consequently, the government does nothing for micropower that is not being done in the private sector, without taxpayer expense. The resolution is negated.	CON	4
S7785529c-A75e184aa	All energy sources need back-ups; wind energy is not uniquely bad	"""Wind energy myths"". Wind Powering America. May 2005 - 4 Wind energy is unpredictable and must be “backed up” by conventional generation. No power plant is 100% reliable. During a power plant outage—whether a conventional plant or a wind plant—backup is provided by the entire interconnected utility system. The system operating strategy strives to make best use of all elements of the overall system, taking into account the operating characteristics of each generating unit and planning for contingencies such as plant or transmission line outages. The utility system is also designed to accommodate load fluctuations, which occur continuously. This feature also facilitates accommodation of wind plant output fluctuations. In Denmark, Northern Germany, and parts of Spain, wind supplies 20% to 40% of electric loads without sacrificing reliability. When wind is added to a utility system, no new backup is required to maintain system reliability"	PRO	5
S669a08bf-Aae913f66	Nuclear Energy should be the primary alternative energy	"Same format as above: 1a) Obviously wind farms take up much land, but the U.S has excessive land that we do not use mostly in the desert where there are plenty of wind. http://hubpages.com... Solar power plants work 24/7 even in cloudy conditions. http://www.grist.org... Building a nuclear power plant cost at least $4 billion, it is more costly to the 130 million for wind turbines that can be decommissioned or moved around. At least there methods do not deplete any resources, unlike nuclear. 1b) A serious nuclear accident would involved deaths and a major change in the surrounding enviroment. There is a 16% chance of a nuclear disaster within the next 40 years. (http://docs.google.com...) Space shuttles like Discovery were expected to have an accident every 76 flights. Instead, in less than 24 flights there were 2 accidents. Considering the fact nuclear power plants are built near cities, chances are nuclear accidents will cause devastating damage to the city. The majority of the cost of the accident will come from taxpayers. Other accidents:(http://www.lutins.org...) 2) Pro agrees because there were no arguments there. 3) Recycling is more expensive than obtaining newly mined uranium. So obviously nuclear companies would mine new sources and enrich nuclear. Metal is recycled more efficiently and economically cheaper than uranium. Not only that but wind turbines can be moved, unlike nuclear power plants. ""Reprocessing doesn't make any sense – economically, it's more expensive"" than mining uranium and just discarding the waste, claims Steve Caldwell, Policy Coordinator for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. http://news.cnet.com... 4) Dave ignored the fact that the U.S has excess deserted land that can be filled with wind turbines, solar panels, and solar power plants. Con's case: 1) Over $96 billion per site. Considering we have many that also has to be maintained over tens of thousands of years and with inflation, so that's over $96 billion. http://www.usatoday.com... 2) Decommissioning a power plant just stripping the nuclear substance cost $320 million per unit. Compare this cost to simply moving solar panels or wind turbines by flatbed trucks. 3) Read my R2 and R3 sources. There were smuggling attempts while transporting uranium. In Russia in 1999 plant workers tried to sell 5 grams of radioactive material to the open market. Several years before some others were caught selling 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium. http://www.atomicarchive.com... 4) One, ""The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world's energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years."" Two, recycling is currently under experiments and very expensive. Plutonium 239 is a highly unstable byproduct of recycling and also increases the risk of an accident. I'm surprised that none had sunk yet; if one did it will contaminate the ocean, like oil. Actually, there was a solution about sinking waste but any rupture, even from one canister, would cause serious major environmental damage. So with that said nuclear energy should not be the primary alternative energy. Voting issues: 1) Davewerty dropped my 2nd rebuttal on his case about high security standards not being able to protect the environment. 2) Davewerty did not have valid sources backing is arguments. Note to Davewerty: always post sources. 3) Nuclear accidents are likely to happen/increase if we increase our use, proven above. 4) In the long run nuclear energy are more expensive than any other alternative sources. 5) U.S has excess desert land that no one live on and are promising to solar and wind power, we should invest more in those instead, basically went in a circle about how alternative energy takes up land and money. 6) Nuclear recycling is currently unstable and expensive so it is not as economical and eco-friendly as other alternatives. 7) Nuclear waste is still a major issue, recycling is not a reliable option. 8) Increase in nuclear energy would increase the chances of smuggling nuclear for ""other purposes."" Thank you and please comment and/or vote. I enjoyed this debate Davewerty."	CON	6
Sf9ecc418-A33cb7d0c	Wind energy is non-dispatchable	"""Pickens Plan Leaves U.S. Energy Security Blowing in the Wind"". Institute for Energy Research. 11 Jul. 2008 - ""Unfortunately, energy consumers can’t tell the wind to blow more when they need more electricity. Typically, the winds blow most consistently in the morning when electricity demand is low, and less during the afternoon when electricity demand is high. The hottest days are the days without wind, leaving the peak load to be met by conventional energies. Reliable operation of the electricity grid requires generation that can be turned on and off the “flip of a switch.” Wind power cannot provide this flexibility."""	PRO	7
Se2550a31-A92b74e1f	Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs	"For this debate, ""alternative energy"" means a fuel, method, or apparatus designed to reduce or eliminate consumption of traditional fossil fuels as they are now employed. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... ""Total costs"" includes all the costs associated with producing, shipping, storing, and using the alternative energy. Costs include dollar costs and environmental impact. Dollar costs include capital costs, indirect induced costs, and operating costs. The resolution is largely moot for private investment in alternative energy, because investors make it their business to understand costs. For private investment, the laws governing environmental impact apply. The resolution has it's primary impact for proposed government funding, subsidies, and regulations. Citizens have a right to know the true costs of government actions not only in terms of what the government is spending, but including the indirect costs on society. An example of the principle of the resolution being applied is the accounting of nuclear power plant decommissioning costs. When a nuclear power plant is ultimately taken out of service, there are significant costs in making the plant site safe. Those are figured into the costs of the plant, disclosed, and accounted for by setting up a fund to pay for the plant decommissioning. (A quirky California law requires decommissioning costs to be disclosed on electric bills; it's about four cents on a $200 electric bill.) Examples of the principle of the resolution being ignored are plentiful. Solar and wind power are generally unreliable. The sun is absent every night. Even in windy locations the wind may cease for many days at a time, or the winds may be seasonal. Consequently, usually a backup power source, like a gas-driven power plant must be added to the grid to pick up the load when the alternative energy source is unavailable. The capital costs of the backup are generally about 70% of the cost of running the plant full time. In other words, the fossil fuel is about 30% of the cost of the power, including the delivery system. Here is an example of wind power being touted as cheaper, while totally ignoring the costs of a backup energy system: http://www.ucsusa.org... The article says that farmers can make money from selling wind energy, but ignores the extra cost to the public. The wind turbine operator is getting a substantial subsidy from ratepayers who must pay the capital costs for two systems. In some applications, no backup system will be required. For example, if solar power is used to supply peak loads to Las Vegas or Phoenix in the summer, it is probably a good assumption that the sun will be shining when the power is needed. If it happens to be cloudy, then the weather is probably cooler so than the air conditioning load will be less, so that seems like a very good application for solar power. However, if the costs are analyzed for Chicago or New York, it's likely that a full accounting would reveal a different story. Failure to perform and disclose total costs has lead to a major policy error in the government subsidies for ethanol. Ethanol production from corn requires lots of energy-intensive fertilizer, an expensive delivery system, and high costs of taking land out of food production. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... That was not disclosed or even a thought through before the policy was committed. The U.S. government is now adopting policies that favor electric cars. The energy and environmental costs http://green.yahoo.com... of making the batteries are generally ignored, and the very high capital costs of the cars is downplayed. An electric car that will run for 40 miles may cost $40,000. http://www.cbsnews.com... To make that widely salable, large government subsidies would be required. Total cost accounting amounts to honesty in developing energy policy. It does not preclude adopting more expensive alternatives. For example, a case could be argued that ethanol and electric cars effective consume coal (to produce fertilizer and batteries) in favor of imported oil. If costs are disclosed, that case can be argued on the merits. The resolution would avoid bogus claims that, for example, if a kilowatt hour of wind power is the same or lower than coal, the wind power is obviously preferable. The wind power costs may be double when the backup generator is taken into account. How much the backup costs is site dependent. In some circumstances, wind power might be used to pump water uphill into an existing hydroelectric project. That's probably much cheaper than having to build a gas-turbine plant. My point is only that full costs should be disclosed. This is a ""should"" resolution. It means that environmental activists and government officials should honestly perform the total cost analysis and disclose the numbers to the public. This is now rarely done, so it would greatly improve the quality of public policy decisions. Con may argue that government should not provide any subsidies. If so, that does not dispute the resolution. Investors should be fully informed of costs even if government is not involved. Con may argue that even when total costs are disclosed, there is economically sound alternative energy. If so, that does not dispute the resolution either. The resolution will nonetheless favor the best solutions. The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	8
S2aa5711e-A326dccdb	We should invest in alternative sources of energy	There are many alternative sources of energy available, and I believe that those that are both renewable and non-toxic would help the environment best. Such sources are solar energy, hydropower, and wind energy. Alone, these kinds of power have seemed to be less-than-needed by the large population, but when put together could have a tremendous positive effect on the economy and the overall homeostasis of Earth. Solar energy is energy gathered from the wavelengths of light produced from the sun, which can be captured with solar panels that contain light-capturing cells. Instead of wasting some of this energy powering huge electrical appliances, it could be kept in it's primitive form to heat houses, water, and small hand-held devices such as calculators, watches, etc. It can also be converted into electricity through various machines. If the United States were to further invest in Solar Power, the citizens themselves would be able to spend less money on house electricity and thus result in more money to the Federal Government, which could be used for multiple things to better our situation with other countries, such as China, to which we owe enormous debt, and as the National Debt decreases, the value of American currency will increase and we will slowly but surely achieve a better political and economic condition. Hydropower and Wind energy are could be used to move rotors or wheels, and the resulting movement would create electricity. These, if used correctly, would greatly decrease the amount of money we use to buy foreign oils and the National Debt would decrease further and the previous results would occur in a quicker time. I thank my opponent for accepting this challenge and wish them luck in the following rounds. :)	PRO	9

S669a08bf-A67d0452b	Nuclear Energy should be the primary alternative energy	"Map: rebuttal then con's case. Clarifications: Nuclear energy: energy derived from nuclear power-plants Primary source: significantly increase of use. Alternative Energy: any energy sources except for coal and oil. 1a) Energy from the wind only cost .2c cents/kWh. This is cheaper than nuclear cost 2 cents per kWh. Therefore, overtime wind turbines are cheaper than nuclear power plants. ""Nuclear energy averages 0.4 euro cents/kWh, much the same as hydro, coal is over 4.0 cents (4.1-7.3), gas ranges 1.3-2.3 cents and only wind shows up better than nuclear, at 0.1-0.2 cents/kWh average. NB these are the external costs only.""(http://www.world-nuclear.org...) 1b) The cost to clean up an accident is tremendous on the taxpayers. And if we are to use nuclear more we are increasing the risk of an accident. ""A serious nuclear accident could cost more than $600 billion in 2004 dollars[2] - taxpayers would be responsible for covering the vast majority of that sum."" 2) Nuclear power-plant must be built near a large source of water to cool the system. This not only disrupts the ecosystem by changing water temperature but also there is a chance of a radiation leakage into the water, thus contaminating the source and the consumers. ""High risks: Despite a generally high security standard, accidents can still happen. It is technically impossible to build a plant with 100% security. A small probability of failure will always last. The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating both for human being as for the nature (see here , here or here ). The more nuclear power plants (and nuclear waste storage shelters) are built, the higher is the probability of a disastrous failure somewhere in the world.""-(TimeForChange.org) 3) Nuclear is not a green energy. Over time of extensive use of nuclear will produce steam (energy), steam will then steady increase global warming. Recyclable nuclear byproducts are currently under experiments, not only that but it is cheaper to buy new sources than to recycle nuclear waste. Nuclear mining and enrichment is dangerous to the environment through mutation. Nuclear reactors do not use only a few grams of uranium, they use by the ton. If reactors were to use only a few grams, we would not be fussing over waste disposal. 4) The US has excess unused land, especially in the desert. Solar panels and wind turbines would be perfect here. a) Wind turbines: cheapest, more reliable, very efficient, low maintenance rate, low accidental rate, and low maintenance cost. http://www.greenleft.org.au... b) Solar panels: cheaper, low maintenance rate, and low accidental rate. http://www.inhabitat.com... c) Hydro electric power is crucial to the ecosystem and to humans in energy, drinking water, and recreational. ""There are many dams along the Colorado River, but not all of them produce electricity. In fact, the main reason the Hoover Dam was built and is operating today is not for its electricity production. The Hoover Dam and the other 50+ dams help control the Colorado River. That is, they control floods, irrigate crops, supply drinking water, make places for recreation, create habitat for wildlife, and generate electricity. Lake Mead, located behind the wall at Hoover Dam is the most important part of the Dam. It is the biggest man-made lake in the United States and provides drinking water to Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix. Las Vegas gets almost all of its water from Lake Mead. While the electricity that Hoover Dam generates is important, living out here in the desert would be impossible without the flowing water of the Colorado River.""-(http://www.eia.doe.gov...) Con's case: 1) Nuclear waste is costly and harmful. It take at least 10,000 years for uranium to be a bit safe. Maintaining these waste disposal is costly. Over 10,000 years? Overtime the cost will outweigh its benefits. 2) Dismantling a nuclear plant is very costly, more than solar panels and wind turbines. 3) Nuclear terrorism involving the waste are high and risky. Increasing usage would produce more waste and thus increasing the chances of nuclear waste being stolen and use as weapons known as the dirty bomb. ""A direct hit by a penetrating 1,000-pound explosive (or equivalent) would likely inflict damage that would disperse tons of radioactive material. ""Destruction of the main feed pump or steam lines,"" says David Rossin, a nuclear expert at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, ""could create problems of decay heat and produce the release of fission products."" Perhaps the most vulnerable nuclear material is in the spent fuel storage pool, according to Rossin, where unloaded core material does not have the same degree of protection as does the reactor core"" 4) Uranium is not renewable. Within 30-50 years at this rate we would run out of uranium from mines. Not to mention all the nuclear waste produced. For the reasons above nuclear energy should not be the primary alternative energy."	CON	12
S2aa5711e-Ae1953d92	We should invest in alternative sources of energy	"I thank my opponent for specifying which alternative energies should be used. As I understand it, my opponent proposes to use a combination of: 1) Solar 2) Wind and 3) Hydropower in order to stabilize Earth and the United States economy. I would like to spend the bulk of this speech focusing on the effects the aforementioned alternative energies have on the economy. First, I'll start with solar: 1) Silicon prices are skyrocketing [1] (This cost will undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer) 2) Solar costs 25 cents a kilowatt hour [2] {ctrl f ""25 cents""} 3) Coal costs 1.75 cents a kilowatt hour [3] {ctrl f ""1.75""} I apologize for the lengthy articles, but they do contain relevant information considering price. I take a break here to crystalize the above information. Currently, solar costs 25 cents per kWh vs coal at 1.75 cents. When you do the math, solar is roughly 14x more expensive than coal. What this means for consumers is that if we use solar, energy bills will increase fourteen fold! When you apply this across the entire nation, our economy simply can't handle it. It means America would be paying fourteen times more every single year. Solar also has some negative effects as it is, but I won't go into that unless my opponent would like me to. This debate has a focus on the economy and so that is what I'm debating. When we look at wind energy, we find that 1) To use wind energy, we'd have to increase fossil fuel use. To create enough wind energy, that's 25x current world peak production [4] {ctrl+f ""100""} 2) Wind turbines can't power the U.S, they have to be supplemented [5] {ctrl+f ""anywhere""} 3) Resource shortages are driving up the cost. [6] {ctrl+f ""shortage""} This cost will be passed on to consumers. Analytically, this shortage also means that wind energy can't be used as expansively as it would need to be, not to mention it can't power the U.S. anyway. 4) Wind costs 7 cents a kWh [7] Wind is 4 times more expensive than coal... energy bills are still increasing, exactly the opposite of what America needs right now. Again, I apologize for the long articles. Feel free to read them if you want to, but searching for the words/numbers in quotes will get you the information I'd like you to pull out of it. Wind, as shown above, can't help the U.S. Not only is it more expensive, but it's getting more expensive as the disparity of resources grows greater. The last form, hydropower, has several sub-sects. Two general sub-sects are hydroelectric (primarily though dams) and hydrokinetics (primarily without dams) Both are refuted below, and I'd like my opponent to specify which form was intended for debate, if there was a conscience decision between the two. Starting with hydroelectric: 1) Dams require a huge amount of capital. [8] Definitely not what our economy needs right now 2) Hydroelectric is incredibly inefficient [9] Hydroelectric would require enormous amounts of money to get a project up and running, and would then be more expensive because the energy output is unacceptably low, meaning it takes more land, and therefore more money, to get the same amount of power. And then moving to hydrokinetics: 1) Ocean pressure creates a challenge. [10] 2) Ocean power won't be significant for decades. [11] {ctrl+f ""contribution""} 3) Wave energy is too intermittent [12] All of this means that hydrokinetic energy is years away because of technological difficulties, and monetary setbacks, and even if it does enter mainstream society, it's too unpredictable to even get a feel for how much energy will be produced. When you look at the three sources of energy my opponent wishes to see in society, they are all expensive: initially, in use, or both. With the amount of damage our suffering economy has right now, we can't afford this. The money to do this would have to be borrowed, which only adds to the national debt [13] because we have to pay it back PLUS interest. Not a good deal for anyone to say the least. I'd like to thank my opponent once again, as well at the readers and judges. I'm sorry for the long post, but there was a lot of information that needed to be presented on these energies. I tried to make things as easy as possible, but with 13 sources, that can be rather difficult. I also apologize if you go on overload from reading this and the sources; I know I have a headache just from typing it. I look forward to the response from my opponent...

Co-Generation as an alternative(1) Instead of replacing, which is what Pro is trying to advocate, it is better to consider Co-generation rather than hunting down thermal power plants. Thermal power plants are governed by the law of thermodynamics, such plants produces enormous heat as waste products.The implementation of Co-generation in thermal plants is used to deal with the excess heat and convert it into energy. With Co-generation, the energy efficiency can be increased to a further 80% as a result instead of the flimsy 33% as what was offered by Pro With energy doubling, it is very easy to meet current energy demands. For us to meet the current energy demand is very important as our lives are highly dependant on electricity. What we use everyday, from cars to dish washers, require electricity. Since the priority of human being is to survive at the expense of other species, We have no choice but to use thermal power plants regardless of the issue of global warming The International Energy Agency, acknowledged co-generation as a viable alternative. "" One technology by itself will not bring about the dramatic changes that are needed to resolutely reform the energy system. Co-generation and renewable, both low-carbon solutions, will be part of the SOLUTION.""(2) Its nice to see your originality pro, but IEA's proposed alternative is very powerful. We have to be realistic in order to change our world The Current Crisis of Renewable energy The adoption of such 'green' technology have garnered lots of negative feedback. Wind turbines are said to produce noise pollution that will likely cause health problems(3). Migraines will start kicking in at the sound of these dreadful turbines(3). Forests are destroyed for the sake of these giant unearthly machines. Over 3,500 acres to be exact(4) while it manages to power 140,000 homes(5) only, out of 5 billion inhabitants on this planet. Moreover, It produces only 7% of the world's energy. Though renewable, its harms weigh more than its benefits. The energy output is not worth it. Who is to justify the millions of species extinct in the blink of an eye? We’ve only scratched 14% of earth's species (6). There's bound to be some extinction when you cut over 3,500 acres.I have no contentions with green energy, but at its current rate, it is disastrously inefficient and too risky.

The problem is when fission occurs it is very difficult to stop. With today's technology the chance of a melt down is around .00026% for the average reactor life. If that meltdown is to occur it would be contained. All modern reactors have a containment building. A large dome completely surrounding the reactor. The containment consist of many feet of concrete and are able to withstand a collision with a fully loaded passenger airliner. Nuclear energy is a declared green energy, the nuclear fission produces two byproducts. One being steam and the other nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is safely contained in canisters that do not allow any radiation or leakage of the waste to reach the outside. In other words nuclear waste does not harm the environment in anyway. Also nuclear waste is can be recycled through a reactor as plutonium, this reduces the amount of nuclear waste as a byproduct. Other energies like fossil-fuel energies produce tons of Co2. Coal-fire energy is extremely dangerous to the environment and is harming it now. The strip mining that is needed for coal causes devastation to landscapes. Coal fire plants use tons and tons of coal per day. While nuclear reactors use fuel rods which consume only a few uranium pellets every 30 years. The numbers between the two energies just do not compare. Other alternative energies don't contend with nuclear power when it comes to being used on a large scale. Nuclear power plants take a few hundred acres to produce its typical 1,000 megawatts per hour. To equal one reactor you would need around 2400 turbines and 60,000 acres and of coarse wind is not always blowing. On average, wind turbines are working at full potential 25% of the time. And a nuclear reactor is always producing energy. To be realistic you would have to quadruple the acres and turbines to equal a reactor. So the numbers would be 9,800 turbines and 240,000 acres. To put it another way 240,000 acres is 375 square miles. And the square miles needed for a nuclear reactor is 2 . This is 1/187.5 fraction. For solar panels to match one reactor, the land needed would be around 5,000 acres. And again solar panels only reach peak energy levels 25% of the time. And again you would have to quadruple 5,000 acres. This would be 20,000 acres of land needed to reach 1000 megawatts per hour. This is a 1/15 fraction. Hydro electric power is just plain unfriendly to the environment. On one side of a dam a river is made much more shallow. The other side of the dam a reservoir is created and thousands of acres of land is flooded, forcing the natural habitat out. Clearly, by the evidence that I have given there is no reason not to use nuclear energy as a primary energy.	PRO	38

S7ae7b591-Ae3806dbd	Wind energy provides for price stability in the long-term, wind will be with us for the duration	The difficulty with wind energy is not whether it will be here in 500 years, it’s whether it will be here next Tuesday. Relying as a long term prospect on something so unreliable is simply building fallibility into the future. A short term reliance on wind would be risky enough, building it in for the long term would be incredibly dangerous. This is particularly true in countries where the weather is considerably less reliable that it is in Europe. Not only does wind face the risk of a shortfall but it also risks surges to the network at times of high wind. Denmark which pioneered wind energy in Europe, and remains the largest producer, is compelled to export much of that energy to Norway and Sweden because production frequently outstrips demand. That’s fine if one nation in the region is relying on the technology; if everyone is then the capacity simply isn’t there[i].

S63114415-Aa3df57b3	Solar and Wind Power plant should replace Thermal Power Plant	"Rebuttal and counter question's 1: Quote: "" Wind turbines are said to produce noise pollution that will likely cause health problems(3). Migraines will start kicking in at the sound of these dreadful turbines(3). Forests are destroyed for the sake of these giant unearthly machines."" 1) Please provide what type of health problems effect due to wind turbine. Researcher Dr. Nina Pierpont of Malone, N.Y., coined the phrase ""wind turbine syndrome"" for sleep problems, headaches, dizziness and other maladies experienced by some people who live near wind energy farms. Her research says wind turbines should never be built closer than 2km (1.24 miles) from homes! Source: http://www.windturbinenoises.org... Therefore, wind turbine should not be located below 2km near the homes. But what about Thermal plant; Does this implies to thermal also!!! No, it should be located more than 10-20 km from homes/forests. Now you yourself compare 2km or 10 km.... New technology, developing wind and especially solar plants have increased its efficiency. now lets look here: "" Wind turbines start operating at wind speeds of 4 to 5 metres per second and reach maximum power output at around 15 metres/second. At very high wind speeds, i.e. gale force winds, (25 metres/second) wind turbines shut down. A modern wind turbine produces electricity 70-85% of the time, but it generates different outputs depending on the wind speed. Over the course of a year, it will typically generate about 30% of the theoretical maximum output (higher offshore). This is known as its capacity factor. The capacity factor of conventional power stations is on average 50%. Because of stoppages for maintenance or breakdowns, no power plant generates power for 100% of the time."" also "" Solar and wind power systems have 100 times better lifetime energy yield than either nuclear or fossil energy system per tonne of mined materials"" Sources: http://www.globalwindday.org... http://www.energymatters.com.au... AND NOW FOR SOLAR PLANT: The theoretical limit for silicon based solar cells is 29% conversion efficiency. Currently, polycrystalline and monocrystalline solar panels generally available have efficiencies anywhere from 12% to 18%. With the addition of solar concentrators, The efficiency of photovoltaics is eventually likely to rise above 60 per cent. Global annual photovoltaic installations increased from just 21 megawatts in 1985, to 32,000 megawatts in 2012. Manufacturing solar cells produces 90% less pollutants than conventional fossil fuel technologies. And most importantly, the solar industry creates 200 to 400 jobs in research, development, manufacturing and installation for every 10 megawatts of solar power generated annually. Source: http://www.energymatters.com.au... Again I am saying that we are not generating energy from single source but with both wind and solar plants which will be almost equivalent to thermal plant. Yes, I agree that we should go hand in hand with all power generating plants, i.e, We can have Wind,Solar and thermal all together for power generation and when solar and wind efficiency and many other factor increases we may reduce the thermal plants. I agree for that with Brother Relativist. We have no idea what will happen in future in power developing system."	PRO	42
S8da25347-Adcdf5f29	The United States should fund alternative energy research	"""This solution still stands on the con side because it counters pros method to the topic."" Don't worry, I completely agree with the eligibility of your stance as Con. First, to address the comment by ""the instigators opening statement seems unclear as to if the government should just fund the initial research or if it should continue to make it viable (eg.Further research, or funding of Infastructure."", I will present a case that supports the current infrastructure of alternative energies, and the main factor on why they are not more technologically advanced today is a lack of funding. The most efficient manner of researching alternative energy is through the private sector. Directly funding companies instead of government agencies will grant growth in both the economic and technological sectors. ""This method is better than through the private sector because the private sector is out for profit, quick solutions. While the government would not have any motives but the ends goal."" This is only the case when the government restricts the contracts to one or a few companies, typically known as no-bid contracts. Before granting a contract to the private sector, the companies must compete for the contract not only by giving the government the best deal but also by having the strongest business proposal. There are risks involved in funding the private sector, but if the companies begin to work out of line and diverge away from the desired goal that the government seeks, then the government can pull its funding as a breach of contract. It seems that the both of us agree on the potential of alternative energy reducing oil dependence and rectifying America's long-term future. The solution to alternative energy has been found, however it has not yet been implemented because of a large gap in technology. Solar voltaic cells and nanotechnology are the future of the United States. Professor Nate Lewis of California Institute of Technology presents a lecture series evaluating and assessing both the theoretical and practical yield of power output for several forms of alternative energy including geothermal, solar, nuclear, and wind. He states that the most efficient manner is solar power, which holds the potential of harvesting 600 Terawatts, but can practically yield 60 TW. This is enough power to solve the world's energy for over a century. Dr. Lewis goes so far as to even provide geographical positions where the solar panels may be placed to successfully provide this much power. Once solar power is instituted, it will lower the cost to all consumers worldwide, emit no pollution, and solve the obvious problem of a limited supply of fossil fuels on earth. The annual consumption for the world is 13 TW annually, 10 of which are fossil fuels, and by the year 2050 it is estimated that the earth will consume almost 25 TW per year. At this rate, unless there is significant alternative energy source, the world will not be able to power itself by 2050. The main flaws with solar power are: 1)Perfecting the nanotechnology of voltaic cells 2)Perfecting the preservation of energy 3)Lowering the cost of the cells by improving technology These projects are a main focus for many engineers, businessmen, and corporations in America, as their production capabilities are limited by their available funds to spend on such projects. These projects need not to be started by the government, but provided additional funding. This eliminates a strong possibility of government spending being inappropriately allocated. Your solution, of government funding its own projects, is inefficient because: 1)Current projects already exist, and merely need funding 2)Less economic benefits 3)Less options for success The solution to alternative energy is an increase in funding, a realistic goal that can be accomplished more subsidizing and government spending."

S7729e8b4-Ae3419e36	Nuclear energy is a crucial alternative energy source that is too valuable to be restricted.	The issue of this debate is whether or not to ban the export of nuclear reactor technology, and team opposition clearly failed to recognize this. The issue is not about which alternative energy source is better in the long run. The burden of proof on the opposition is to show to us how banning the export of this technology will do more harm than good. At team proposition, we believe Nuclear energy has a wide scope for future development, but we also strongly believe in the allowing nuclear technology to grow in a responsible and sustainable manner. By banning its export we are allowing countries to develop this technology themselves in a much more sustainable and safer manner. At the same time, it is imperative that other alternatives to Fossil fuel powered plants must not be ignored. Countries that are unable to develop nuclear power systems themselves should progress towards other alternatives, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal power plants are much more safer than nuclear power plants when it comes to their maintenance in developing countries. Using other technologies is much cheaper and unlike Nuclear power plants in developing countries, they do not pose a threat to regional security. Again it is essential to clarify that we support development of Nuclear power plants by countries themselves but we strongly oppose the import and export of such sensitive systems. Hence as a responsible proposition we encourage the use of alternative energy sources in the greater good of the international community, purely as an alternative for countries who cannot develop such technology themselves.

S63114415-Aca694e4	Solar and Wind Power plant should replace Thermal Power Plant	"I'd like to express my gratitude to Pro for presenting a strong case. I'd like to thank him for that preposition. Before we start I'd like to clarify the missing picture in R2. The picture is supposed to show right before ""renewable energy supplies the world around 7% on average"", the source is http://technologygreenenergy.blogspot.com... Here is the picture (Should the picture fails to appear, please refer to the source given above, It is a supplement to my given contention in R2) I'm really sorry if it troubles my opponent, I have very minimal experience with this website's interface. Please forgive me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Before I add any new arguments, I'd like to make rebuttals first. Firstly, Pro asks and I quote ""Please provide what type of health problems effect due to wind turbine"". My source have already provided the list. You said so yourself with Dr Nina Pierpont's research hence supplementing my argument that Green Industries cause numerous pollution. Pro's Pollution Argument Pro mentions that with thermal power plants, the following will occur: a) Acts as a huge contribution to global warming b) The area required to build one is huge c) Overall Costs are expensive than Solar and Wind And if we are to embrace ""green energy"", these problems would fade away which he demonstrates in R3. The issue with global warming is a common one, It does EXISTS but the trend is over exaggerated. Humanity's role in producing global warming is hugely questioned, I have no credentials to judge but a fellow expert, Carter(1) argues that global warming is neither environmental or scientific, but a ""self-created political fiasco"" as he put it(2). Temperatures from 1998-2005 showed not an increase, nor a status quo but a slight DECREASE according to the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia(2). Thermal power plants hardly affects the pace of global warming given that these years were the golden years of us taking fossil fuels for granted. Since pollution hardly affects global warming, there is no point in pursuing expensive conventional green energy as temperatures would still remain around the optimum line. The resolution is disapproved. Comparison of Costs and Size The biggest wind power plant around the world(as of 2013) is the Alta Wind Energy Center, occupying 9000 acres(3). The energy produced from this enormous giant is a mere 800 MW(3). Compare that with a simple Kashima Oil Power station, the plant produces a staggering 5,204 MW(4). It yields 5-6 times better energy than green resources. Since the fear of frying warming the earth is inconsistent, there is no point in chasing an ideological crusade that yields little results. Pro says this reduces overall expenses but without a source, it is unverifiable. Even if its true, thermal power plants significantly produce more energy than wind or solar hence the point of replacing is irrelevant. Pro's Energy Efficiency analysis Pro's R3 argument made a lot of factual analysis on solar and wind power plant, how much conversion efficiency they have, Furthermore he concludes: ""but with both wind and solar plants which will be almost equivalent to thermal plant."" Well, Let's add solar power plant to the equation. I have already proven how an oil thermal station yields 5-6 times more energy than the largest wind power plant. Now, Let's take any existing photovoltaic power station(5) and combine them with Alta's energy yield. I'll take the largest MW yield, Perovo in Ukraine, since it claims to have 100 MW(5). Total energy yield between Alta and Perovo= 900 MW Total energy yield of a normal Kashima Power station= 5,204 MW Comparing both, there is still a huge gap with little to no difference, thermal power plants are still 5-6 times larger. Kashima isn't even the largest thermal plant and it still manage outwit both wind and solar on a huge scale. Hence, there is literally no incentive to pursue wind or solar as thermal power plants yields a chuck load of energy more than green resources. Most of my sources above are from wikipedia, it is acceptable to use them as this debate deals with general concepts, not one which deals with specifics. I'll reassert my alternate preposition, Why would you replace thermal power plants for something that yields significantly less? With global warming dismissed as a ""self-created political fiasco"" by Carter, Then Why do you still intend to pursue green energy considering that temperatures had little change over past decades? Continuing with additional arguments, Economic Advantages It is sufficient to say, given my above contention that wind and solar are also 5-6 times more expensive than non renewable resources. Poor countries could not afford such luxury to buy equipments just for the sake of being green while their national dept quadruples. The brandt report(6) accurately illustrates this divide between the north and south. In other words, It is the difference between the first world and the third world. A summary map of their research is given here(7) In general(based on their research),the north contains 4/5 of the world's wealth while the south collects the remaining 1/5. This is a huge gap, more so that the south contains 3/4 of the world's population while the north takes up only 1/4(6). For the south to adopt green industries would be disastrous for their economy. The bargain is not worth it. It yields significantly less energy and with global warming dismissed by its lack of consistency, it is not realistic for solar and wind to replace thermal. Thus, the motion that wind and solar should replace thermal is nullified. I have proven my case that economically, it is better to stick with Co-generation whilst having a triangulation of both sources, instead of one replacing the other which the resolution is desperately vying to prove. Thank you Pro for your case and I rest mine. :D Sources (1)http://en.wikipedia.org... (2)http://www.telegraph.co.uk... (3)http://en.wikipedia.org... (4)http://en.wikipedia.org...

Wind Turbines have a capacity factor ranging from 20-40% [2], whilst Nuclear Power Plants have a capacity factor of 90.9% (2013 figure) [3]. Also, Wind Turbines have to be turned off when the wind is blowing too strongly in case they catch on fire, and also in a lot of other non-mild weather conditions. This fact was highlighted well in 2013 when over just 2 days, Wind Farms were given £5 million to turn off the Wind turbines, leaving thousands of homes without power [4]. #3 Wind Turbines cause large amounts of noise, which causes psychological stress Scientists have found that people can experience psychological stress because of the amount of noise that wind turbines produce [5]. This is a massive problem when you consider the fact that it would take 2077 Wind Turbines to produce as much energy as one Nuclear Power Plant [6]. #4 Wind Turbines contribute further to problems with housing Keeping the last statistic in mind, let's think about what impact it means Wind turbines will have on housing. It's not good, 2077 Wind Turbines doing the same job as one Nuclear Power Plant [7].

S63114415-A9db78481	Solar and Wind Power plant should replace Thermal Power Plant	Sorry for the delay. Brother has misunderstood the energy generation by the 3 plants specified by him.

As I have said earlier, we are still in developing mode, we will Insh'Allah try to increase the energy production by solar and wind Plants by the proposed new technologies. When the energy production increases we will slowly substitute Solar and wind in place of Thermal. Brother has misunderstood by the economical aspect; Solar plants are much cheaper that thermal plant; this is due to: 1. No moving parts involved, hence less losses 2. it needs less components than thermal Solar panels can be planted over a house for that individual home itself and reduce the thermal consumption. In this way we may reduce the thermal plants. As adopted in Germany. It depends on you; whether to help others or not. Let us assume I am a rich person, I plant a couple of panels on top of my house and my energy consumption is less than the energy production then I will send the remaining energy to the poor instead of my neighbour if he is rich. We need to understand our brothers and help each other. In that way there is no different world will be created. Forget about the people what they are doing. You do what is said by the Humanity.

Se452ca97-Ad2bbf953	Looking to the future, we should fund Nuclear energy rather than Wind energy.	"Efficiency of Nuclear vs. Wind My opponent did not supply a source on his claim that Wind Turbines (not bladeless ones) have an energy capacity of ""60% or higher in some cases"". This is false, as a study from 2012 (which makes it even newer than one graph my opponent used), shows the difference of energy capacity between Nuclear and Wind being 55% [1]. But even this is not really representative of the efficiency of Wind Turbines, as they are also dependent on the weather, which is highly variable throughout the year. This fact was highlighted by the BBC nicely three years ago when on December 21st 2010, when Wind Turbines made up less than 0.1% of the electricity generated [3], despite renewable sources of energy making up 6% of the total energy consumption in the UK in 2010 [4]. [Round 3] The Problems with Offshore Wind Turbines Con dropped my four reasons for the impracticalities of Offshore Wind Turbines. The Problems with bladeless Wind Turbines Conventional wind turbines directly harness the wind's mechanical energy to spin a generator. It's adding at least one step to the process: the wind's mechanical energy pressurizes a fluid which then turns a turbine, and Saphon has not proved that said step even exists. This is especially alarming because of the extraordinary claims made about this Wind Turbine's energy capacity compared with that of a regular Wind Turbine. The Safety of Nuclear Power Plants The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) has disproved many claims similar to the ones that Con has been making of Nuclear Energy, namely that they emit dangerous amounts of radiation, that their radiation causes cancer and other harmful effects, and that people near Fukishima in Japan died because of the radiation [5]. However, the point about Wind Turbines catching fire still stands because it exists. Wind Turbines contribute to further problems with housing Claim: ""the argument that wind turbines are not popular is invalid due to the fact that in the UK about 80% of the people are in favor of wind energy, while only 5% are against it (the remaining 15% are undecided)"" Just because they are in favour of Wind energy in principle, does not mean that they would like to have a Wind Turbine in their back garden, as it were. The prevelance of protests against local Wind Turbines/farms can be proven by just doing a simple search on Google images [6]. So, the argument stands and so does this point. This pdf file [7] shows the massive amounts of land that would be needed to accompany Wind Turbines. External Costs: Nuclear Power Plants vs. Wind Turbines An academic report in the journal Energy policy conducted just last year concluded that it is significantly cheaper to keep nuclear reactors as opposed to replacing them with Wind Power backed by Natural Gas [8], not only because of external costs from pollution or accident damage, but also from daily operating costs. Effects on employment: Nuclear vs Wind For every job created in Wind Energy and renewable energy in general, 3.7 are destroyed [9] due to driving up energy costs, reducing competitiveness, and deterring investment [10]. Conclusion I feel that I have comfortably made seven good points that back up my case: 1. Nuclear Energy is more reliable than Wind Energy due to not being dependent on the weather 2. Offshore Wind Turbines have numerous faults that make them vastly inferior to Nuclear Power Plants 3. Bladeless Wind Turbines have faults that make them inherently inferior to Nuclear Power Plants 4. Onshore Wind Turbines have numerous faults that make them inferior to Nuclear Power Plants 5. Nuclear Power Plants are not a danger 6. Wind Turbines are a danger, even if just a small one 7. Wind Turbines will have a very negative effect on employment, unlike Nuclear Energy I urge you to vote pro. Thank you. Sources [1] http://www.nei.org... [2] ibid [3] http://www.bbc.co.uk...

Se2550a31-A51017628	Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs	Con's counter proposal is defective because it does not facilitate public policy debate. The reason why total costs should be disclosed is to get all the facts on the table to facilitate an honest debate. Had that been done, for example, with ethanol or wind power, we might have greatly improved the laws pouring large sums of the taxpayer's money into subsidies. On the other hand, we might have focused more effort into using solar power for demand peaking in the large cities of the American Southwest. Con's counter proposal is another mechanism for ensuring that none of the real issues are avoided. Con's case contains numerous irrelevancies. For example, whether or not global warming is, overall, favorable to human affairs is irrelevant because alternative energy source are sought to reduce foreign dependence on oil, and because it is inevitable that fossil fuels will run out. In addition, most utilities are tightly regulated by government, so there should be an ongoing discussion of the cost-effectiveness of alternatives.

S7ae7b591-A29f371e9	Wind energy is unreliable and provides only an irregular source of supply – and even then only in some countries	Nobody disputes that any energy strategy will have to include a shift away from the way much of the developed world depends on energy. Clearly energy conservation must be part of the process, but so should micro-renewables. In both categories wind power is the best available option – cheap to build and easy for small scale energy users to use as an when they need it and when built in the right place is reliable, in the UK wind energy is generating 75-85% of the time.[i] Moreover any worries over reliability can be alleviated by building numerous wind farms over a wide area as the wind is always blowing somewhere.[ii] Battery capacity is easier to build on a smaller scale and surplus can be exchanged internationally relatively easily. All power supplies require backup[iii]. Power outages apply just as much in the supposedly stable world of fossil fuels; surplus capacity is built into any system.

S63114415-Ab0eb9dad	Solar and Wind Power plant should replace Thermal Power Plant	We have lots of Thermal Power Plant all over the world. About 40% of the worlds electricity comes from coal. The energy efficiency of a thermal power plant is typically 33% - 48%. The waste products released by a thermal power plant are carbon dioxide and water vapor, as well as other substances such as nitrogen, nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, and (in the case of coal-fired plants) fly ash and mercury. All these gases are green house gases which pollutes the environment and especially causes Ozone layer depletion. We all know about the negative effects of thermal power plant with reference to air pollution but let us take its land and transmission side effects. 1) As thermal plants should be located far away from the load, Transmission line increases leading to loss in power distribution. 2) The area required to build a thermal power plant is quite big. 3) It has lot of components such as heaters, boilers and even flue tower etc. 4) Due to all of this components, the installing cost is high also the capital cost for the land. CAN SOLAR AND WIND REPLACE THERMAL? In my opinion yes, up to a certain level. Considering the above points 1) Solar plant can be located near the load, hence transmission line cost decreases. 2) The area required to build Solar and Wind Plant is less compared to Thermal plant, hence capital cost is reduced. 3) It has less components, ant the components used in Solar is very Compact. Any Disadvantages? 1) Solar can be installed in areas where there is a high peak sunlight. 2) Wind plant should be located where there are high pressure winds. Now, we can combine Solar for day time and wind for night time to provide 24 hrs electricity production. The disadvantages of Solar and wind can be overcome by proper arrangement and storage of electrical energy in batteries.	PRO	62

S3f5268f-A90c5bdfe	Nuclear > Wind	"Wind energy is preferable over nuclear energy for several reasons. For the reasons presented below, I am in firm negation of the resolution. Contention 1: The dangers of nuclear power. A) Every dollar spent on nuclear is one less dollar spent on clean renewable energy and one more dollar spent on making the world a comparatively dirtier and a more dangerous place, because nuclear power and nuclear weapons go hand in hand, says""Mark Z. Jacobson, an American scientist (1). If we rely on nuclear power for energy, we are opening ourselves to the temptation of nuclear weapons. B) There are now over 148,274 invalids on the Chernobyl registry in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. There is widespread agreement regarding a rise in thyroid cancer in those who were exposed to the radiation when they were very young. There are reported rises in other thyroid diseases, immune system disorders, and learning problems in children. There are extensive reports of high rates of heart and blood problems and lung and gastrointestinal disorders. However, the cause of these problems is not agreed among scientists and professionals. Some contribute these conditions to the stress of having been exposed to radiation and to the decline in medical care and income following the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many of those exposed at the time of the accident have now reached adulthood and are having children. There are some indications that these children may be suffering from radiation effects on their parents (2). Nuclear power is very dangerous, as it involves radiation. Radiation has very dangerous health effects. As shown in the data above, many people are still having medical complications from Chernobyl's nuclear meltdown in 1986."" C)""If a meltdown were to occur, the accident could kill and injure tens of thousands of people, leaving large regions uninhabitable. And, more than 50 years after splitting the first atom, science has yet to devise a method for adequately handling long lived radioactive wastes (3). We have no way to completely control nuclear energy. The waste is to dangerous to be dealt with."" Contention 2: Nuclear power is not as environmentally friendly as wind. A)""The front end of the cycle is not clean. Every gram of 20% uranium ore brings to the surface some 3000 becquerels of Radium-222. Radium also gives off radon which gives off alpha radiation--a hazard for mine/mill workers (4). The waste put off by nuclear power is extremely hazardous. There is only so much of it we can safely contain before an accident is bound to occur."" B) Moreover, nuclear reactors themselves give off tritium radioactive gas into the air--not so clean after all! (4). This radioactive gas goes into the atmosphere. There is no effective way to deal with it. C)""Some 93% of the refrigerant chlorofluorcarbon produced in the USA is used in the enrichment of uranium fuel for nuclear power. These compounds are 10,000 times more efficient than carbon dioxide at trapping heat, and therefore are a potent destroyer of the ozone layer in the stratosphere (4). While nuclear power may not emit as much c02 as oil and natural gas, it instead emits a gas more potent than c02. Switching to nuclear power will not help to stop or decrease global warming but instead will increase it. D)""Wind energy is a source of renewable energy. It does not contaminate, it is inexhaustible and reduces the use of fossil fuels, which are the origin of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. In addition, wind energy is a ""native"" energy, because it is available practically everywhere on the plant, which contributes to reducing energy imports and to creating wealth and local employment (5). Wind energy does not emit greenhouse gases or much less radioactive particles. It has no greenhouse effect associated with it, making it a much better option than nuclear when looking at the environment."" E)""Wind energy does not generate waste or contaminate water""an extremely important factor given the scarcity of water. Unlike fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, wind energy has one of the lowest water-consumption footprints, which makes it a key for conserving hydrological resources (5). Wind power has no water footprint either. While nuclear power takes water to work and in turn contaminates it with radioactive waste, wind power neither relays on, or contaminates water. Contention 3: Wind energy is favored by the people. A)""No fewer than two in three Americans want the U.S. to put more emphasis on producing domestic energy using solar power (76%), wind (71%), and natural gas (65%) (6). Americans want wind over nuclear power. America's survey results are a sample of what the world wants. If governments across the world drop wind energy in favor of nuclear, they are causing strife between them and their people. B)""WASHINGTON, D.C.///March 22, 2011///While a drop in public support for nuclear power would be expected after an incident like the Fukushima reactor crisis, the nuclear disaster in Japan has triggered a much stronger response among Americans, a majority of whom would freeze new nuclear power construction, stop additional federal loan guarantees for reactors, shift away from nuclear power to wind and solar power, and eliminate the indemnification of the nuclear power industry from most post-disaster clean up costs (7). As if the survey wasn't enough, this will further show that people do not want nuclear power any more. They instead want wind energy, a better, safer, cleaner alternative.

Pro concedes to this resolution as he says in his R3 argument: ""Yes, I agree that we should go hand in hand with all power generating plants, i.e, We can have Wind,Solar and thermal all together for power generation and when solar and wind efficiency and many other factor increases we may reduce the thermal plants...I agree for that with Brother Relativist."" Untouched Refutations I am responsible for denouncing the resolution with proper reasons and I have rightly so. Pro did not respond to my refutations at all as he continued with his energy efficiency analysis instead so I assume that my refutations have successfully nullified his argument. This includes: a)Global Warming Myth(By Carter) in response to his greenhouse gases. b)Crisis of Renewable Energy(As an additional problem to green energy, to shift support towards thermal) -Extinction of various types of species as a result of destroying 3,500 acres(9000 for Alta Wind Farm) of forests. c)Economic Problems for poor countries -The Brandt report accurately elaborates how poor countries are, thus unable to afford green energy (which is in opposition to the resolution as it advocates replacements, which are very expensive) d)Pro's energy efficiency analysis (Elaborated below) These are my main oppositional arguments and they are left virtually untouched by Pro and with no responses, I hereby conclude that my argument have successfully denounced his resolution. Other Minor details Throughout this debate, my opponent seems so fixiated on energy capacities. He devoted his last round to prove that it is at least 3-5 times(instead of 5-6). Even his round 3 argument was devoted to this same concept. Regardless, Thermal Power plants still yields more energy than the combination of both Perovo and Alta, thus it is more reasonable to adopt conventional measures. Pro made an analysis on solar cells but fails to provide how it is linked to the resolution as he did not provide a proper evaluation. Pro claims that thermal power plants should be 2km away from homes, the same should be done with Wind. The main point is to find incentives on why wind should replace thermal, if they are both floating on the same boat, then there is no reason to adopt the resolution as both are essentially the same Conclusion My refutations are my main contentions for disapproving the resolution. Without any response, his argument is nullified along with the resolution.

Se452ca97-Aa2f2633a	Looking to the future, we should fund Nuclear energy rather than Wind energy.	"Counter-argument #1: The amount of Steel and concrete Wind Turbines use A Canadian engineer who specializes in energy production has revealed that Wind Turbines use 5-7 times the amount of steel and concrete as a Nuclear Power Plant, on a per MegaWatt basis [1]. This is very significant if you want more efficient/safe Wind Turbines, as one of the flaws of Wind Turbines is their very tall and slender structure [2]. By increasing the height of Wind Turbines, you'd also have to increase the amount of steel and concrete used dramatically. This is a particularly bad problem as the Wind Turbines talked about in the first source have only a 25-30% capacity factor. My opponent then starts to talk about how you can build Wind Turbines in many places by increasing the size of the rotors, yet the rotors are actually the cause of many of the faults in Wind Turbines - the noise, their impact on housing, and the amount of birds that are killed each year by Wind Turbines, currently at 20,000-37,000 [3]. Counter-argument #2: The problems of offshore Wind Turbines Granted, offshore Wind Turbines sound like a brilliant idea, just like Solar Roadways or Powdered Alcohol. But then we look at the facts, and then they don't sound so much like a good idea after all. First Problem: Faulty foundations In May of last year, 52 of 140 offshore Wind Turbines in the Wind Farm GGOWL were found to have faulty foundations by engineering firm Fluor Ltd - that's 35% [4]. Second Problem: They rot into the sea All the steel that the Wind Turbines are made of will rot/rust [5], and do you know where that will go? Into the sea, which is polluting/littering it. This is bad for the environment. Third Problem: The change in Sea currents As described here: [6], offshore Wind Turbines (particularly farms) obstruct the sea currents and as a result, it causes one end of a beach to drown in heaps of sand, and the other end of a beach, the sand has been washed away, making those areas to be very unsafe and in need of massive repairs costing a lot of money. Fourth Problem: The damage done to Natural Carbon sinks Offshore Wind Turbines damage Natural carbon sinks [7], which means that more CO2 will be created than saved by Wind Turbines. This makes Nuclear a more viable alternative, as they do not produce Carbon Dioxide [8]. Counter-argument #3: Even considering Bladeless Wind Turbines, Nuclear is still more cost-efficient and in most cases even cheaper My opponent claims that bladeless turbines have an energy capacity of over 80%, but this is not the case. His source claims that it is nearly 80%, which means that even the bladeless turbines' energy capacities are inferior to that of Nuclear energy by 11% [Round 2, source 3]. Aouini states that his turbines cost ""nearly half as much to make"", implying that they cost slightly more than half of what ordinary turbines cost as if it were slightly under, he'd say ""under half as much to make"". Using Chris Heaton-Harris MP's statistics from the second round [Round 2, source 1], that means that even the cheapest kind of Wind Turbines (double the cost-efficiency of Nuclear), Wind Turbines with subsidies, would be significantly less cost-efficient than Nuclear energy. Counter-argument #4: Advances in Wind/Nuclear Energy The only advances that my opponent could name in Wind Energy that have increased the energy capacity of wind energy that isn't the bladeless Wind Turbines are making the Wind Turbines taller, which I have showed has problems and would not add to the cost-efficiency because either more materials would need to be used, there'd need to be added maintenance costs, or the Turbines would not last as long, all resulting in the same amount of cost-efficiency despite there being able to be more wind for the turbines to harness. Conclusion: Nuclear Energy is much more cost-efficient than Wind Energy, and so deserves more funding. Sources [1] http://www.windturbinesyndrome.com... [2] Lombardi, D. (2010).

S7ae7b591-Adba5c63c	Wind energy is an economic form of energy generation reducing both running costs and environmental harm	"The installation costs of an entire wind farm are, admittedly, fairly high – although they pale into insignificance compared to an oil station or a nuclear plant – but after that there is almost no associated cost whatsoever. In addition to which farms can be built incrementally; a half completed wind farm is simply one that is half its original size for virtually any other form of power generation it’s an all or nothing proposition[i]. Furthermore, many experts agree that so-called micro-renewables will play an increasingly important role in the energy future of the planet and wind energy is the example par excellence of how this can be done; the most basic homemade windmill can power a generator and wind power predates electricity – offshore and on – by centuries.

S3f5268f-A9eb5e4b9	Nuclear > Wind	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate **Carbon Dioxide emissions** i) Direct emissions A report by Professor Gordon Hughes of Edinburgh University shows that the difference in carbon dioxide emissions between Nuclear energy and wind energy is ""either insignificant or none"" [1]. A report from parliament gives a similar conclusion, stating that wind energy saves ""little or no CO2"" [2]. ii) Carbon footprint Wind Turbines, on a per megawatt basis, use 5-7 times the amount of steel and concrete that nuclear power plants do [3]. **Job Creation** i) Gross jobs created Statistics from the Nuclear Energy Institute [NEI] show that nuclear, on a per megawatt basis, creates 10x the amount of direct jobs that wind energy does [4]. ii) Impact on jobs indirectly A study by consultants Verso Economics has shown that currently, the 'green' sector, of which wind creates a plurality in Britain [5], destroys 3.7 jobs for every job it creates [6]. Whereas in the case of nuclear energy, the NEI has proved that for every 100 jobs in the United States created by nuclear energy, an additional 66 jobs are created, and another 726 jobs throughout America [4]. **Unreliability of Wind** The unreliability of wind energy was highlighted in figures from December 21st 2010, where wind turbines created only 0.04% of all energy created that day [7], despite the fact that wind made up approximately half [5] of all non-Hydroelectric renewables in Britain that year, and that category created 6% of Britain's energy that year [8]. **Deaths caused** Calculations show that wind turbines, on a per terawatt basis, cause 3.75x the amount of deaths that nuclear power plants do [9]. **Creating a sustainable economy** In late April of 2014, Germany's economics minister and Vice Chancellor to Angela Merkel, Sigmar Gabriel, said that Germany's 'transformation' into renewable energy is ""on the verge of disaster"" [10]. **Effect on Human health** Experts warn that wind turbines can cause psychological stress [11], and in the worst instances, could make you deaf [12]. These statistics are particularly worrying when you consider the fact that the American Nuclear Society [ANS] have estimated that it would take 2,077 wind turbines to create the same amount of energy as one nuclear power plant [13]. Problems caused by Wind Turbines' noise affecting health are often referred to as Wind Turbine Syndrome [WTS], which is confirmed by research from Canada [14]. **Wind Turbines' susceptibility to the weather** When the wind is too strong, wind turbines have to be manually turned off in case they combust. Over the past three years in Britain, wind farms have been paid 70 million pounds of Tax payers' money to turn off their turbines [15]. In July of this year, it was found that cases of wind turbines catching on fire are ten times as common as previously thought [16]. Considering the facts that a Wind Turbine has a life-span of 20 years [17], reports from UCL & the University of Edinburgh showing there being 117 fires globally per annum & 200,000 turbines worldwide [18], approximately one in every 85.4 wind turbines will combust at some point in its lifetime. 200,000/(117*20)=~85.4 [19] Number of objects/(Number of incidents per year * How many years the object lives for) **Cost-efficiency** George Taylor Ph.D. calculates that the costs of wind energy can be as much as double as what is advertised by the Energy Information Administration [EIA] due to hidden costs [20]. Similar figures come form Chris Heaton-Harris MP, leader of the Together against Wind campaign, who estimates that when hidden costs and subsidies are included, wind costs at least twice as much as nuclear, with wind costing ""100/MWHr, whilst nuclear and other fossil fuels cost ""50/MWHr [21]. **The effects of Fuel poverty in Britain** From 2012-3, there were 31,000 extra winter deaths in England & Wales [22], 30-50% of which can be attributed to fuel poverty. By funding costly energy sources that have a net negative impact on job growth, we are fueling these deaths. Sources [1] http://docs.wind-watch.org... [2] http://www.publications.parliament.uk...

S6140b8cc-A2724bd04	Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)	"My opponent has forfeited the previous round, which is bad conduct, especially so when he initiated a five round debate. A five round debate signals he wanted to get into details. In this round I present the economics of micropower. Micropower from wind costs more than twice conventional power and micropower from solar costs more than four times conventional. there is nothing in the government ITP program that hints at bringing those high cost down. It seems they are just looking at a very few odd applications, ike getting methane from pig farms, while pretending that it might make wind or solar viable. Micropower from gas turbines is well advanced by industry, so there is no need for government funded research there either. wind and solar depend critically on a power grid for the backup when the wind dies or when there is no solar at night, so the grid will not go away. Here are all the calculations, with the references to the costs: Coal, nuclear power, or combined cycle natural gas turbine power delivered over a grid costs about $0.055 per kWh. Small scale wind power, using the grid for backup costs about $0.082 per KWh, and solar with the grid for backup costs $0.24 per kWh. If the grid is not used, than any expensive gas turbine or diesel generator that could provide all the power must be purchased and kept idle for 35% to 50% of the time when wind or solar happens to be available. Even then there must be a local grid so a gas turbine is shared in the neighborhood. Therefore, there is no economic need for micropower because micorpower increases the cost of electricity substantially over not having micropower. ""Micropower"" means ""power distributed on a small scale using local generators."" http://www.tfd.com... There is nothing in the definition that implies the source of the power. One of the earliest applications, c. 1986) was to heat a swimming pool with the waste heat from a small diesel generator. The electricity generated could be either used locally or sold back to the power company through the grid. The goal was to heat the pool, but generating electricity as a by product made the cost of heating less than using a straight heater. Now pollution laws have caught up, and this application is not so common. In remote areas, the cost of micropower can be less than running long transmission lines to a central grid. In developing countries, there isn't any power grid to hook to and micropower is a way to electrify areas incrementally while avoiding the expense of constructing a regional or national grid. Micropower installations are also used for hospitals, radio stations, semiconductor manufacturing, and other application where it is important to maintain power if the grid fails. Large power plants are generally more efficient than small ones. In this debate, my opponent says we need micropower for economic competitiveness. Micropower is only competitive in special circumstances, such as when miles of line are required to connect to the grid. Here are the costs, per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by various methods: 1. Hydroelectric 0.009 2. Coal $0.029 3. Nuclear $0.030 4. Combined cycle gas turbine $0.03 to $0.05 5. Large-scale wind $0.047 6. Small-scale gas turbine $0.052 7. Biomass gasification $0.07 to $0.09 8. Small-scale wind $0.08 9. Small-scale Diesel $0.30 (I will guess that small scale gas turbine is a about the same) 10. Large-scale solar $0.20 to $0.30 11. Small-scale solar $0.20 to $0.50 References 1 and 6: The Bureaus of reclamation gives costs of hydro, nuclear, coal and small-scale gas turbine power as 0.6. 2.1. 2.1, and 3.4 cents per kWh, respectively, in 1995-1999. http://www.usbr.gov... Current coal and nuclear costs are around 3 cents, so I estimate that their numbers for hydro and small-scale gas turbines have risen about 50% as well. References for 2 and 3: http://www.nucleartourist.com... Nuclear includes plant decommissioning, but apparently not waste disposal. My understanding is that waste disposal is around 20% of total cost. 5 and 8: American Wind Energy Association http://www.awea.org... adding back in the 2.1 cent per kWh wind production subsidy http://awea.org... 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11: http://www.solarbuzz.com... These are solely the generation costs. They do not include the cost of operating a grid. All the large-scale generators require a grid for distribution. Biomass is medium scale; if you happen to have a pig farm, the methane will likely be reliable and the power consumed locally. that's good for pig farms, but not for most of the population. All the other methods usually use a grid for backup. There are a few low-power applications where batteries are practical for the backup. To use wind or solar without a grid, in most applications either a small gas turbine or a diesel will be required in addition to the wind or solar energy source. To figure the grid cost, consider that the cheapest delivered price of electricity to consumers in the US is $0.0635 in Idaho (hydro) and $0.0665 in West Virginia (coal). http://www.think-energy.net... Consequently the maximum cost of a grid for relatively short distances, the diameter of West Virginia, must be no more than $0.035 cents per kWh, the rest being for the coal generated electricity costs. However, that no doubt includes state taxes and regulatory costs as well. Being generous to the states, the grid cost is maybe $0.025 and more depending upon the grid distances covered. So coal, nuclear, or combined cycle gas turbine costs about $0.030 + $0.025 grid = $0.055 kWh. Small scale wind assuming 65% availability is $0.08 + $.025 grid + 35% x $.03 backup = $0.12 kWh Small scale solar is 50% available so it is $0.20 + $0.025 + 50% x $.03 = $0.24 KWh. People pay a lot more, depending upon the state. That may be because of longer transmission costs. California gets 25% of it's power from out of state so as to keep power plants distant. Also, the state requires some users to subsidize others, adding greatly to costs. those are artificial artefact's of government, not fundamentals of cost structure."	CON	74
S3f5268f-Ab56abf3e	Nuclear > Wind	"Concerning the reliability of NEI Con addresses the reliability of NEI and says that NEI is biased because it says on its about page that ""our mission is to foster the beneficial use of nuclear technology"".

Moreover; NEI has 350 members from 17 countries [41], agrees to voluntarily measure and publicly report its greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions each year, and owns the only source of long-term trend data on the 'wide variety of questions that are needed to measure and fully understand the different facets of public opinion about nuclear energy' [42].

Considering this, what would be the point in spinning the truth to push a source of energy such as nuclear, when it would be significantly more profitable to introduce Green Taxes, Wind subsidies, etc. and drive the poor into the ground? Concerning Germany's energy policy Germany is one of the biggest users of wind energy in the world [44], so much so that its wind energy consumption is equal to the 183/196 lowest countries' consumption [44, 45]. If there is any type of energy causing a problem for Germany, it certainly isn't nuclear, as nuclear energy has progressed in the past few decades so much that there have been no disasters caused by nuclear power in Germany post-1990 [46]. Concerning the amount of deaths Wind and Nuclear cause Con dismisses the reliability of the source on the basis that the post includes the line ""I wrote this back in 2008"", however he has clearly not read the source comprehensively, as the source takes note of it and adds the figures for 2011 as well [9]. Despite global wind consumption ~doubling, the amount of deaths wind causes has stayed the same (so have the death count for nuclear) on a per terawatt basis. If Con wants to continue to dismiss this source as outdated, perhaps he would like to provide an example of a development in wind energy in the past 3.5 years that dramatically decreases the death count. Concerning Wind energy costs Con questions the reliability of the site www.togetheragainstwind.com, as according to him, there is no author provided and the piece isn't dated, however: The website is owned by Chris Heaton-Harris MP, a current Conservative member of Parliament [47]. The website [48] aims to put forward a successful campaign leading into the 2015 General Election. The page on the cost of Wind energy is linked on the front page, with the page dated '2014' at the bottom [47]. Con also raises concerns on the fact that I haven't mentioned specifically the hidden costs of wind, so I will mention them now: The National Air Transport Service [NATS] have been funding a major programme combatting Wind Turbines' adverse effect on the radar systems that keep commercial aviation on course, the first phase of which has costed £14 million [49]. Subsidies [Chris Heaton-Harris MP] The cost of needing to have ower stations on standby for when the wind stops blowing [50] & the additional fuel that wind imposes on primary plants [20]. Operations and maintenance costs [20] The cost of transmission [20] The cost of transmission losses [20] Concerning job creation by Wind/Nuclear I have proven beyond reasonable doubt that NEI is a trustworthy source, ergo it remains true that Nuclear creates 10x the amount of jobs directly that wind does. Con concedes that including effects on job creation indirectly and directly, wind has a net negative effect on job creation, as for every job created in renewable energy (wind energy is the worst of all renewable for job creation by far), ~ 3.7 are destroyed. Con has not demonstrated that his statistic on the amount of jobs a wind farm will create over its entire lifetime is incosistent with the facts I have shown proving nuclear to be significantly better than wind in net & gross effect on job creation. Concerning Nuclear energy and Methane Con's third contention has no sub point C, despite his claims. Con's third contention isn't even related to the effect nuclear energy has on the environment. There were zero mentions of Methane in the debate before Con's last round (Ctrl-F is useful here). Con has not given any source linking Nuclear to Methane, let alone a significant amount of it. Concerning WTS Con grasps at straws and emphasizes the word 'certain' in the line in an article I linked to saying ""The study by a panel of independent experts found that the irritation caused by the noise around wind farms can effect certain individuals"". This practically takes nothing away from my argument, as Con has dropped my arguments on: The scientific proof of WTS [14, 40] The scale of WTS [36-9] Con grasps at straws again to say that the article claims that scientists dismissed the idea of WTS, which is a very weak argument when he has not even addressed on WTS being confirmed by Canadian Research [14], and WTS being recorded in Denmark [40]. Con also does this again, but this time it's the government claiming this. However, this move would be in their best interests, considering that at this time, the Red & Blue tories were very much trying to sell the idea of renewable energy to people. Before the last election, David Cameron signed a contract with a list of promises if he got elected [51], one of them being to be the greenest government earlier, with him later u-turning on this promise, calling for the removal of 'Green crap' [52]. On the contract, the Conservative party proudly said that if they failed to deliver the promises, to kick them out in 5 years time. Needless to say this contract is now deleted from their website. Concerning the unreliability of Wind energy Con seems to have misunderstood the point I was making here. The point is that Wind energy's potential for energy creation varies wildly throughout the year depending on the season, as the BBC figures show. Concerning ""weather"" Con says: ""nuclear power plants are also susceptible to mother natures wrath. The Fukushima disaster was caused by a tsunami. I beleive majority of you will agree with me if I say a nuclear power plant being destroyed is more dangerous than a few fires."" *believe It would appear not, as the death count of Nuclear vs Wind, which I have referenced earlier in this argument, shows. Concerning fuel poverty I have proven that nuclear is significantly superior to wind energy when it comes to: Job creation Cost-efficiency Therefore, wind is a significantly bigger driver of fuel poverty deaths than nuclear energy is. 22 Statistics & Facts used by me and dropped by Con completely The amount of steel & concrete Wind energy uses on a per megawatt basis [3] Wind creates a plurality of the Green sector in Britain [5] The Green sector destroys 3.7 jobs for every one it creates [6] Wind Turbines can make people death [12] It would take 2,077 wind turbines to create the same amount of energy as one nuclear power plant [13] In the past three years in Britain, £70 million of Tax payers' money has been given to Wind farms to turn their Wind Turbines off [15] Wind Turbine fires were found in July of this year to be 10x as common as previously thought [16] Wind Turbines have a life-span of 20 years [17] Reports from UCL & the University of Edinburgh showing there being 117 fires globally p.a. & 200,000 turbines worldwide [18] 200,000/(117*20)=~85.4 [19] From 2012-3, there were 31,000 extra winter deaths in England & Wales [22] Mark Z. Jacobson's junk science [23] The history of nuclear weapons/war between USA & the Soviet Union [25] Government in Western nations would monitor and test any food/water that could be unsafe [26] The levels of radiation at Chernobyl are the same levels of radiation you'd be exposed to on a commercial jet [27] Fast-breeder reactors would dramatically decrease the amount of high-level reactors [28,29] The average person living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant is exposed to the same amount of radiation as they are from their smoke alarm [30] CFC claims use data from 2001 on a 1950s reactor, and are unreliable [31] Using nuclear fusion, nuclear is renewable [28, 32] Even the disaster at Fukishima posed no threat to water [35] Scale of reception to WTS [36-39] WTS recorded in Denmark [40] Thank you.

Sb4dd798f-Abbf54144	Nuclear Energy	"Resolved: The United States federal government should increase investment in nuclear power sources. I am representing the affirmative position of the resolution. I will be claming that the USFG does need to increase investment in nuclear energy. Definitions: 1) Investment--a contribution of something such as time, energy, or effort to an activity, project, or undertaking, in the expectation of a benefit (source: MicrosoftWorks dictionary) 2) Nuclear power--the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work, most of the time with the goal of producing commercially servicable electricity. Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is ""ready for market"". Explanation of Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. Nuclear energy is among one of the world's cleanest energy sources. It produces very low levels of CO2 emissions and, during its lifetime, is comparable to so called ""green"" energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro emissions [1]. The most up-to-date study, conducted at the Forsmark nuclear power facility in Sweden during 2005, shows that the plant was producing only 3.10 grams of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [1]. In contrast, information gathered from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency shows that the average coal power plant in the United States during the year 2000 produced 2.095 pounds of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [2]. A simple mathematical calculation revels that nuclear power, on average, produces almost 97.8 percent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal power. Thus, nuclear power would be beneficial because it would lower carbon emissions consequently increasing air quality and curtailing this nation's contribution to global climate change. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. Currently, oil is the lifeblood of the American economy. Oil supplies 40 percent of the United States' total energy demands [3]. Today, nearly 60 percent of the oil utilized and consumed in the United States is imported from foreign countries [4]. Using middle school math, we can concur that 24 percent (nearly one-fourth) of our energy is supplied by oil drilled, refined, or otherwise produced in foreign countries. Noting the current geopolitical situation and the worldwide increase in oil demand, relying on foreign oil does not seem like a viable long-term economic strategy for the United States. Thus, the United States should be investing in other sources that can supply our nation with the energy its needs for continued global economic dominance. Nuclear power is the energy source that is best positioned to take that role as it has become one of the leading energy sources in the world. For example, nearly 75% of all energy consumed in France is produced by nuclear sources [5]. Not only has nuclear energy provided the French people with energy security, it has lead France to become a net energy exporter as it gains over 3 billion Euros (4,312,800,000 USD) from exporting nuclear power and nuclear power technology [5]. As it is clear to see in the precedent set by the French government, nuclear energy is a sustainable long-term energy source that can lessen a nation's dependence on unreliable, foreign-energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is ""ready for market"". Unlike wind and solar energy, nuclear energy is a proven energy source that has been in use since 1942 [6]. Thus, the wide-scale adoption of nuclear energy in the United States would require very little additional research and development as most of the technologies to be used have already been formulated. Furthermore, the more widespread adoption of nuclear power in the United States would require no changes be made to the national power grid as it was constructed with nuclear energy in mind. In contrast, there are some questions about the practicality of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. I thank whoever shall accept this debate challenge in advance. Happy debating!

Because of this, there must be a replacement source of energy. The definition of Alternate is to take place of. This means any thing that provide energy for a source. Given this fact this means that when Fossil Fuels run out there has to be an ALTERNATE source. We are already working with many alternate resources such as Solar energy, Wind power, and others.

S2aa5711e-Ae6882a86	We should invest in alternative sources of energy	"With no arguments to combat, I guess I'll use this speech to basically recap all of my arguments and explaining why I feel I have won this round. I'd like to pull all my arguments through to the last round... For a summation of my arguments: On solar * Silicon (the material used in solar panels) is becoming expensive. This is because the supply is dwindling. When we take this into consideration, we won't be able to make enough solar panels unless we find several more deposits of silicon. I'd also like to bring up that silicon is a main component in many computer chips, forcing any technology (computers, cell phones, video game systems, etc.) to increase in price as well. * Coal is really cheap. Plus, the U.S. has lots of coal deposits; we're actually a leading exporter of coal. Using coal provides no further harm to the economy, as it's status quo. * Solar is excessively expensive. In fact, it's 14 times more expensive, meaning our electricity bills would increase 14 fold... an unreasonable shift in our economy. On wind * Would need more fossil fuel usage. Something has to make turbines and transport them. And those would be factories that use coal/oil and trucks that run on diesel. We're not making the environment any better by using wind * Wind needs to be supplemented with other forms of energy. * Resource shortages are driving up the cost, and no company is gonna foot that bill; it will fall upon consumers' shoulders. * Wind is 4 times more expensive than coal, so it also drives up the cost of electricity. On hydro (I'm going to group them together this time, my opponent can do the same) * Dams require a large amount of money to build, something that's lacking in the current system * Hydro power is inefficient * The oceans massive pressure creates a problem * Won't make a dent in U.S. consumption for decades * Too intermittent And that pretty much covers my last speech. I've referenced it a couple times, and my opponent did in the first speech, ""it"" being the environment. Should my opponent like to say that the extra cost is worth fixing our environment (despite the fact it's not. Our economy is experiencing overwhelming losses in every sector), I'll respond with the fact that the three forms of energy my opponent brought up all replace coal. Nothing on that list replaces oil. Coal only makes up 25 percent of our energy demands [1] {second slide} My opponent's proposed energy forms don't account for 55% of the fossil fuels! The above arguments (from this speech and the last) prove that: 1) Using my opponent's proposed energies will not fix the environment and 2) Using my opponent's proposed energies will not fix the economy. For those reasons, I strongly urge a CON ballot. I'd like to thank my opponent for starting the debate, the readers for taking time to read this, and the voters for reading and taking interest enough to voice their opinions. I'd like to ask the judges to judge only on the merits of the debate and not to bring personal opinions into the matter.

S3f5268f-Ae8d615e7	Nuclear > Wind	"--Rebuttal-- Con quotes Mark Z. Jacobson on how nuclear weapons are linked to nuclear energy, however Mark Z. Jacobson is hardly an unbiased or respectable source, as it's been shown that his attempts to quantify the death toll of fukishima are junk science [23]. But to quote Margaret Thatcher, ""A world without nuclear weapons would be less stable and more dangerous for all of us"" [24]. Con talks about the danger of being tempted by nuclear weapons, but this was notably demonstrated to thaw the cold war, once the world's two greatest superpowers, the United States of America and the Soviet Union, saw how disastrous the concept of nuclear war really was [25]. Con cites the disaster at Chernobyl as a reason why nuclear power is dangerous, however this doesn't even remotely apply to modern nuclear power plants for the following reasons; - Chernobyl was the product of a severely flawed Soviet-era reactor design, combined with human error - Key differences in modern Western reactor design, regulation, and emergency preparedness makes it 'highly unlikely' that a Chernobyl-type incident could happen in the modern Western world - One of the main reasons Chernobyl was so bad was because the government did not begin emergency evacuations until 36 hours after the event - The government in Western nations, after a disaster such as this, would monitor and test any food/water that could be unsafe (see: the Three Mile Island incident in 1979) [26] All modern Western nuclear power plants have extensive safety features to prevent large-scale accidents and radioactive releases. The Chernobyl reactor had none of these and was unstable at low power levels. Even with the poor reactor design, the officials could have averted many radioactive exposures to the population with an effective emergency response. But still it is a point of interest that the levels of radiation at Chernobyl are similar to the levels of radiation you'd be exposed to is the same as you're exposed to on a commercial jet [27]. Con also brings up the point of nuclear waste, however this problem is avoided with the use of Fast-breeder reactors, which would 'dramatically decrease' the amount of high-level waste [28, 29], Roger Helmer MEP writes. Con raises concerns about the amount of radiation that is produced by nuclear power plants, despite the fact that nuclear power plants emit radiation at such a level that the average person living with 50 miles of one is exposed to the same amount of radiation as they are from their smoke alarm [30]. Con uses one source to argue against the tritium radioactive gas and chlorofluorcarbon that nuclear power plants produce, however this is extremely misleading, as the data the source bases its claims on is from 2001 data on a 1950s power plant [31]. Besides previous evidence given of how big the problem of types of radiation produced from nuclear power plants really are, as it's pointed out, current strategies of using highly efficient gas centrifuge technology will use no CFCs and will therefore avoid these problems. Con claims that nuclear is not renewable, but it actually is, using nuclear fusion, a process which uses hydrogen and means that we will be able to have an unlimited supply of (significantly cleaner) nuclear energy [28, 32]. He also, in the same paragraph, implies that wind is significantly better than nuclear because of their difference in greenhouse effect. However, as scientific evidence from Professor Gordon Hughes of Edinburgh University and Parliament shows [1, 2], the difference between wind and nuclear in Carbon Dioxide emissions is either insignificant or none. But even if we didn't have this evidence, that wouldn't be a reason to use wind energy over nuclear energy, because as Google engineers in IEEE spectrum Ross Koningstein & David Fork pointed out after Google's rejection of renewable energy (3 years after cancelling their project RE Con's final point to support his contention that nuclear is not as environmnetally friendly as wind is that nuclear energy ""contaminates water"", however this does not appear to be a problem in modern Nuclear technology, as even the incident at Fukishima posed 'No threat' to water [35]. Con's last contention is that wind energy is more supported by the public, and I concede that if you do a survey and ask people what sounds like a good idea, wind energy/renewables or fossil fuels/nuclear, they will opt for wind, but numerous incidents in the past have shown us that when people actually experience what it is like living close to a Wind Turbine, they often develop a strong opposition; - Petition in Alabama, to stop Wind Turbines, started by a 6-year-old girl, receives over 1,000 signatures [36] - Over 2,000 people march against Wind Turbine proposals in Ireland (2013) [37] - Over 7,000 people march against Wind Turbines in Dublin, Ireland (2014) [38] - Three families in Wisconsin leave their homes because their symptoms of WTS are so severe [39] - WTS recorded in Denmark [40] - Research in Canada confirms WTS [14] Sources [23] http://www.marklynas.org...

Se452ca97-A23a251ab	Looking to the future, we should fund Nuclear energy rather than Wind energy.	"Rebuttal #1 Nuclear Energy is Cheaper than Wind Energy Currently, this statement is true; wind energy is currently a more expensive energy source than nuclear energy is. The reason for this is due to the fact that: a) The technology is newer than nuclear energy. b) There is less wind energy being produced. The price of Nuclear energy has reached a constant now and is not decreasing as much as the price of wind energy due to the fact that there are less advancements in the technology and therefore no reason for the price to fluctuate. In wind energy, however, the price is dropping dramatically because the technology has greatly improved and wind energy can be produced more efficiently. Due to this, it is expected that the price of wind energy will continue to drop until it has reached its technological summit. This scenario is very similar to other renewable energy source. Graph B shows how the price of wind energy has dropped in the past three decades: Graph B: [1] #2 Nuclear Energy is more efficient than wind energy To start off, my opponents source saying that wind energy has a 20%-40% energy capacity is invalid due to the fact that it was published in 2004. Currently the energy capacity for wind energy is at 60% or higher in some cases (not mentioning the bladeless turbines). Also, my argument showed how energy capacity in wind turbines has not yet reached its summit as nuclear energy has and how it shows great potential to possibly reach or exceed the energy capacity of nuclear energy. Graph C displays the rapid increase in wind energy's capacity: Graph C: Also, the argument stating that wind turbines can potentially catch fire is not a valid argument due to the fact that this only occurs in 0.0012% of wind turbines [2]. If the argument here is that wind turbines are not safe then I would like to enlighten my opponent to the fact that only 14 people died in the last year in turbine related accidents [3]. This is compared to nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl which initially killed 56 people and then killed over 6,000 due to cancer developed from the radiation. Another piece of information that displays that nuclear energy is safer than wind turbines is that in 2007 a study called the ""KiKK study"" in Germany showed that children under the age of five that iived within 60 miles of a nuclear power plant had a 120% higher risk of developing leukemia and almost a 100% higher risk of developing cancer [4] #3 Wind Turbines cause large amounts of noise, which can causes psychological stress. Noise factor is definitely a major problem that is presented with wind energy. However just like all the other aspects of wind energy, it is currently being tweaked and made superior to previous models. Many companies have been working to resolve this issue, and it turns out that by lowering the amount of noise that a turbine creates (apparently not a particularly challenging task) then the turbine itself actually becomes more efficient. According to GE, reducing the amount of sound that a wind turbine produces can actually increase the amount of energy that can be produced by as much as 2% [5]. in conclusion. lowering the amount of sound that a wind turbine produces will lower the amount of cases of stress and also increase energy capacity. #4 Wind turbines contribute to further to problems with housing. The wind turbine itself takes up very little room, and in a wind turbine plant the turbines themselves only take up about 1% of the land. This means that the surrounding 99% of the land can be used for a variety of things such as farming and housing. Also, the argument that wind turbines are not popular is invalid due to the fact that in the UK about 80% of the people are in favor of wind energy, while only 5% are against it (the remaining 15% are undecided) [6]. Conclusion: My opponent does not seem to understand that my argument is not that wind energy is currently superior to nuclear energy and therefore his rebuttals consist of evidence of modern day turbines vs. modern day nuclear plants. My argument is quite the opposite of this, as I am saying that wind energy has more potential than nuclear energy and therefore requires further funding for it to reach this potential.

S6140b8cc-Ab470bb8c	Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)	"Since my last alternative energy debate was so interesting, I thought I'd keep it up by starting another one, with more specific wording to avoid the meta-debates that occurred in my last debate. This topic is: ""The United States federal government should increase funding for the Department of Energy's Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) to give grants for micropower."" 1. My first argument is that the status quo is unacceptable: a. According to the Department of Energy, the current electricity generation and distribution model in the United States is based on a centralized grid. b. There are (at least) five problems with the centralized grid model: i. Sabotage: According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the because much of the grid is unprotected, our energy infrastructure is one of the most vulnerable targets to terrorists. A terrorist strike would cause nationwide blackouts. ii. Global Warming: The centralized grid promotes fossil fuel based energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Fossil fuels have caused global warming, which threaten to destroy the planet. iii. Economic Competitiveness: The ITP program is vital to nine key energy intensive industries, supply 90% of the materials to the U.S., produce $1 trillion in revenue, directly employ 3 million people, and indirectly employ 12 million people. iv. Spillover: Micropower can be used to aid developing countries. According to Seth Dunn, an energy specialist at the WorldWatch Institute, providing micropower to North Korea can reduce the chance of nuclear proliferation. v. Oil dependence: Currently, the U.S. imports more than 60% of the oil it consumes. According to Dr. Martin Feldstein, our dependence on oil is a security threat. Iran has declared that any hostile actions taken by the United States would cause them to destroy the Straits of Hormuz, cutting off 20% of the U.S. oil supply. c. Current subsidies for non-alternative forms of energy prevent micropower from becoming mainstream. According to Bioenergy Update, the $120 billion in subsidies for fossil fuels prevents a shift away from the centralized system. 2. My second argument is that the ITP/micropower program can solve these problems: a. First, micropower is a system of distributed generation of electricity, using solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, and other forms of renewable energy. Essentially, a business would generate its own electricity on-site, based on the most appropriate renewable source, thus bypassing the need for a centralized electric grid based on fossil fuels. Although it has become more popular in recent years, there are still barriers to widespread adoption. b. The ITP program currently gives out $175 million in grants for micropower projects. However, this amount is tiny compared to the $120 billion in annual subsidies for fossil fuels. c. Micropower can solve the five harms I outlined above: i. Sabotage: A decentralized grid means that there would be no place for the terrorists to strike if they wanted to disable the electricity supply. Since each business would generate their own electricity, there would be no supply to interrupt. ii. Global Warming: According to Bioenergy Update, if the U.S. switched to a micropower based system, we could cut carbon emissions by 50%, much more than our current targets. iii. Economic Competitiveness: The ITP program funds projects in nine key industries, several of which are struggling for global competitiveness. If they were able to access low cost renewable energy, they could better compete with their foreign rivals. iv. Spillover: As stated above, micropower gives countries an opportunity to work together and increase international cooperation. According to Mr. Dunn, this lessens the risk of North Korea becoming belligerent. v. Oil Dependence: According to NPR, developing alternative fuels has the ability to shift us away from oil dependence to a form of domestically generated renewable energy. d. The ITP program actually works. According to the Department of Energy, more than 140 new technologies have been created by ITP-private firm cooperation. e. The plan can be accomplished without adding to the deficit if fossil fuel subsidies were ended. With the $140 billion in money that goes to oil and coal companies, the ITP program can develop and spread micropower technology to businesses, which can then spread it to consumer use, all without adding a dime to our budget deficit. Hopefully, someone will pick up the gauntlet for this debate, and it will be an interesting discussion!"	PRO	112

RSC: ""To better understand the relative importance of the cost of CCS and its effectiveness in avoiding CO2 emissions, we performed a comparison of carbon avoidance via CCS and using alternative energy technologies. ... Considering ratios All three alternative energy technologies considered were found to be much more cost-efficient than CCS at avoiding CO2. The carbon avoidance ratio (ie the CO2 amount avoided by a $5.1 trillion investment in alternative energy over 100 GtCO2) was determined for each technology using CCS as a base case. Wind, nuclear and geothermal power had CO2 avoidance ratios of 1.9, 4.3, and 4.5, respectively. In order for CCS to be competitive with wind and nuclear, the cost of CCS must be improved to $26/tCO2 and $12/tCO2, respectively. In addition to better CO2 avoidance on a per-dollar basis, alternative energy technologies also resulted in revenue, while CCS has no significant revenue. Wind, nuclear, and geothermal power were estimated to result in revenues of $9 trillion, $22 trillion, and $31 trillion, respectively, for a $5.1 trillion investment over 50 years. Our results show that, with current technology, CCS is less effective than alternative energy in avoiding CO2 emissions. We can most effectively address this issue by pursuing virtual CCS, including investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and biofuels until research in CCS (which also faces significant thermodynamic issues4) makes it competitive with alternative energy."""

PRO	118
S669a08bf-A10913aa3	Nuclear Energy should be the primary alternative energy	I will makes my comments on your argument by corresponding them with the same template. 1a) I have already made my point on the use of solar and wind. They are more of a small scale energy. One wind turbine cost 1,000,000 dollars. A farm of 100 would cost 130,000,000 dollars. That lot of 100 would not even produce the amount of one nuclear reactor. Industrial solar panels cost 40-80 thousand dollars. Just imagine a farm of them. And again both these energies do not work 24/7 as nuclear plants do. 1b) You need to put things into perspective. What exactly is a serious nuclear accident? Do you mean an accident like Chernobyl or an accident like 3 Mile-Island. If Chernobyl, that accident happened in 1986. The U.S has much more advanced nuclear technology then that of Chernobyl of 1986. Also Chernobyl did not have a containment building, as all modern nuclear plants do. An accident like Chernobyl happening in the U.S today is next to impossible. If you meant a 3 Mile-Island accident, the worst accident in U.S history ,then you are looking at more of a 900 million dollar clean up. Not a 600 billion dollar clean up. Also that accident was in 1979. So, again our technology is much more advanced. The damage done to the surrounding areas of 3 Mile-Island are minimal. Residents that live next to the plant receive more radiation form the sun then the melted reactor. 3) Nuclear is a declared green energy by the government. Steam produced from nuclear plants create green landscapes as it is keeping plants well watered 24/7. The steam has almost no effect on the acceleration of global warming. Recycling of nuclear waste is not practiced by the U.S only. Every other nuclear country recycles nuclear waste and they prove that recycling waste is practical. Yes, mining of uranium is not very friendly to the environment but you must also ask where all the metal to make wind turbines come from. The answer is mines as well. 4) Previously answered Your case 1) What could the cost of letting a canister full of waste sit in a designated area be? The maintenance is not expensive. Also if Jimmy Carter did not make recycling of nuclear waste illegal the amount of waste would be significantly lower, which would ultimately lower the maintenance cost. 2) Nuclear plants last up to 50-65 years. And almost all plants are not dismantled. They are stripped of nuclear substances and are left to crumble. 3) Obviously you have not seen security at a nuclear plant. I can guarantee that there are no terrorists stealing nuclear waste from secured canisters or diving into the fuel pool to steal waste from fuel rods. Let me know when terrorists in the middle east can send a rocket 5000 miles across the earth and hit a containment building precisely. 4) One, those numbers are wrong. We are looking at a 240 year supply. Two, like a said recycling nuclear waste would increase those years significantly. I have one last thing to say. The U.S Navy has been using nuclear power for decades and have not encountered one problem.	PRO	119

Sf4c49f83-Adc571754	Nuclear power is beneficial for society	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. In each argument I plan to only post one point. Now to refute my opponents idea that hydro power combined with wind and solar could in theory power the US, I would first like to point our that that hydro power causes huge habitat destruction and involves the flooding of an area in order to build the dams necessary. The main problem with hydro power is simply that it requires water in order to build and usually involves damming up a river. However, in many states and in US and places all over the world, there are places where water is not abundant enough to be dammed up as opposed to being used. Now, in order to refute his second point that energy that is most easily found is the supposed ""best"" energy. Following my opponent's logic, then fossil fuels should be the best alternative because there is a large amount of it. I beg to differ. Furthermore, his point on how there has been ""catastrophic"" disasters in nuclear, there has not been a single casualty or even injury in all of the year's that the US has used nuclear reactors and nuclear energy. Now, I can nearly guarantee that my opponent will at some point bring up the Chernobyl incident as why nuclear energy is unsafe. However, one must understand that the Chernobyl nuclear plant had NO CONTAINMENT dome for some reason over the plant. Also, the plant was made using soviet style nuclear plants, which have improved tremendously in terms of safety. Nowadays, all of the plants in the US are build using the western style and no casualties have happened in the US as a result of a nuclear plant malfunction. Furthermore, my opponents point about how there is no chance of hydro, solar or wind of hurting citizens is rather unfounded. The following is a table obtained from http://nextbigfuture.com... It is the deaths per TWh produced by each energy. Coal – world average 161 (26% of world energy, 50% of electricity) Coal – China 278 Coal – USA 15 Oil 36 (36% of world energy) Natural Gas 4 (21% of world energy) Biofuel/Biomass 12 Peat 12 Solar (rooftop) 0.44 (less than 0.1% of world energy) Wind 0.15 (less than 1% of world energy) Hydro 0.10 (Europe death rate, 2.2% of world energy) Hydro - world including Banqiao) 1.4 (about 2500 TWh/yr and 171,000 Banqiao dead) Nuclear 0.04 (5.9% of world energy) My opponent's point that nuclear technology can be stolen and turn into potential nuclear weapons is rather amusing. Every single country in the world that currently has nuclear bombs first made the bombs as a result of military use and AFTER that began to develop civilian use nuclear factories. N. Korea already has nuclear bomb but has never actually used the on another country, and as you claim, if a country is so dangerous then there is a very high chance they will use nuclear bombs. However, N. Korea has not currently done so. Finally, if the technology of nuclear is as easy to steal as you claim it is, why don't terrorists just steal the thousands of nuclear bombs that the US already has? Now, back to my second point. Nuclear power can actually produce enough power to replace fossil fuels. It is actually viable. If solar were to replace the power that nuclear is producing CURRENTLY, it would have to cover New Jersey. If wind were to replace the nuclear energy currently produced, it would have to cover West Virginia. Hydro power can only be made on a river or lake and thus has very limited areas where it can actually produce energy. Nuclear power plants can be built anywhere and the energy produced by a single nuclear atom is 10 million times that of a coal atom. France is currently the world leader in nuclear energy and it has never had any casualties as a result of nuclear power. France has also reduced its CO2 levels compared to other countries. Essentially, my second point is that nuclear power can actually replace fossil fuels at a low cost and can easily generate enough power to power the US. Hydro, wind, solar etc. do not."	PRO	121

Sf074f81a-A9e9171ea	Nuclear Power	"Thanks, bsh1! I apologize in advance for my delay. I have been extremely busy over this past weekend and I like to put a lot of time and effort into researching and writing my arguments. I. Framework I mostly agree with my opponent's framework. Countries should do what is best for their people and for their citizens, thus, my burden and goal is to prove that prohibiting nuclear power would be a net harm to citizens, and I will be showing the net-positives of nuclear power. II. Scientific Consensus Nuclear power is inherently a scientific issue. When I look at science issues, the first place I go is to journals and to experts in the particular field in question. Although a scientific consensus does not in of itself prove the benefits of nuclear power, understanding the scientific consensus helps us to understand where the scientific evidence actually leads. The science is clear not because of the consensus, but rather a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. In 2015, Pew Research took a poll of scientists that represented the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), one of the largest bodies of scientists in the United States. Their poll found that 65% of AAAS scientists favor building more nuclear power plants. By contrast, only 35% of AAAS scientists support expanding offshore drilling [1]. III. Reliability Nuclear power is one of the most reliable energy sources today. Unlike most alternative forms of energy which require natural gas and traditional sources of energy to back it up (more on this later), nuclear power does not. Furthermore, nuclear energy by far has the highest average capacity as can be seen in this chart [2]. Nuclear Matters notes: ""Nuclear power is the most efficient and reliable source of large-scale, around-the-clock electricity. Nuclear energy plants maintain a national average reliability between 85 and 90 percent, with many power plants routinely operating at 93 to 95 percent capacity over extended periods."" Furthermore, ""High reliability and dependability mean that electricity is available on the grid whenever needed, all the time.This is particularly important during periods of extreme heat or cold."" [3] IV. Environment A. Global Warming Climate change is undoubtedly one of the greatest environmental threats we face today. Bruno Comby notes: ""If we want to be serious about climate change and the end of oil, we must promote themore efficient use of energy, we must use renewable energies – wind and solar –wherever possible, and adopt a more sustainable life style. But this will not be nearlyenough to slow the accumulation of atmospheric CO2, and satisfy the needs of ourindustrial civilization and the aspirations of the developing nations. Nuclear powershould be deployed rapidly to replace coal, oil and gas in the industrial countries, andeventually in developing countries"" This is because ""Nuclear energy produces almost no carbon dioxide, and no sulfur dioxide ornitrogen oxides whatsoever. These gases are produced in vast quantities when fossilfuels are burned."" [4] Furthermore, climateologist James Hansen noted: ""Nuclear, especially next-generation nuclear, has tremendous potential to be part of the solution to climate change. The dangers of fossil fuels are staring us in the face. So for us to say we won't use all the tools [such as nuclear energy] to solve the problem is crazy."" [5] B. Sustainability As I mentioned earlier, one of the problems with other alternative energy methods is that they all rely on fossil fuel and natural gas as a backup. [6] Furthermore, other methods are unable to supply the large amounts of energy that we consume each year. A 2014 paper published in Sustainable Materials and Technology concludes [7]: ""Renewable energy sources (primarily wind and solar) will not be able to supply the needed large quantities of energy sustainably, economically and reliably. In addition, renewable energy sources with fossil-fired backup power will in many cases not contribute towards reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions. Distorting the market with subsidies and by legislation to attract intermittent energy technologies into applications for which they are not well suited is economically wasteful. Also, replacing stand-alone coal-fired stations with stand-alone gas-fired stations will, in many cases, not result in a reduction in the rate of emission of greenhouse gases due to (often poorly quantified) problems of methane leakage. Countries that depend on imported natural gas should be aware that they carry full responsibility for their part of the global consequences due to atmospheric leakage of methane associated with their part of the imported gas, including the leakage taking place outside their borders."" In conclusion, a total ban on nuclear powe all at once would not be a wise move. V. Costs I'll go into more detail in the next round as this was also one of pro's contentions. Nuclear energy is one of the most affordable sources of power we have today. There is little fluctuation in the production cost, is one of the lowest-cost producer of baseload electricity, and among the most efficent sources of energy in the US. [8] The following chart gives a nice visual representation of the cost. (Image from: http://tinyurl.com...) VI. Summary In conclusion, we ought to embrace, not prohibit, nuclear power.

S3f5268f-Ae0acfde9	Nuclear > Wind	"*concerning co2 emissons* My opponents evidence states there is little or no difference in co2 emissions between the two. I have no problem with that argument in itself. It's a great advantage for both side. However, I will direct your attention to contention 3, sub point C, which states that methane, ten times more powerful than co2 is emitted from nuclear power plants. More on methane by saying, Methane (CH4) is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the United States from human activities. (1) and""If methane is allowed to leak into the air before being used""from a leaky pipe, for instance""it absorbs the sun's heat, warming the atmosphere. For this reason, it's considered a greenhouse gas, like carbon dioxide. (2) *concerning carbon footprints* I do not find the amount of concrete it takes to build something to be an issue. Wind does not have as huge of an impact as my opponent makes it seem."" All forms of energy extraction and generation entail land use and habitat impacts, whether in terms of mineral extraction or emissions. Wind energy projects do not contaminate or pollute the land upon which they are built, or any adjacent waters. (3) concerning job creation Great. More jobs. However at this time I would like to point out that this argument is not unique to nuclear power. Any business anywhere will create jobs, including wind energy. Planning, building and operating a typical utility-scale wind farm creates 1,079 jobs over its lifetime (4). Developing, constructing and operating a windpark requires coordinating the efforts of many different teams and individuals. Each of the three stages involve different steps: During the pre-development and development phase, jobs created include: Project developers Field engineers Environmental managers and consultants Legal and permitting support Community outreach Document control Administrative and office support.(8, used again below) I would also like to point out that his source, the nuclear energy institution, has the possibility to be biased. From their about us section 'our mission is to foster the beneficial use of nuclear technology.'(5) This source has a strong chance of bias, and therefore cannot be trusted."" Concerning the unreliability of wind. In this argument my opponent uses a study and data that took place over a single day as his first source. If this is intended as an argument, more data that is gathered from several days is needed to provide a more accurate representation. We also must consider the information that is left out of these arguments, such as how many wind turbines are used in Britain, as a small number of turbines will result in a small amount of electricity. Concerning the death wind causes"" This information is outdated. The opening sentence from the article used is""I wrote this back in 2008. (6). There are also very strict rules about wind turbines and plants as well. ""Where danger could arise from pressurization, the plant will have vents.""(7). I give you one sentence from a 43 page document on wind energy rules. Concerning economics I will begin by saying that tge Germany argument applies to all renewable energies, not specifically wind. That being said this argument could apply partially to nuclear power as well. In contrast to what my opponent says, wind is beneficial to the economy. ""Windparks bring economic development to the rural communities that host them. Developing our nation's wind energy resources creates demands for turbines and turbine components, which stimulates the manufacturing sector. Wind energy helps to stabilize wholesale electricity costs, which is good for both consumers and for businesses. (8) ""The exact amount will vary from state to state and town to town, but a good rule of thumb is at least $1 million per megawatt over a twenty year period. For example, Noble's three Clinton County, New York windparks (located in the towns of Altona, Clinton, and Ellenburg) total 280 megawatts, and are expected bring about $360,000,000 to the local community over the next 20 years."" (8.) To sum up this argument, wind energy is a extreme benefit to it's surrounding economy."" Concerning health I would like to show you the opening quote from the first source given.""The study by a panel of independent experts found that the irritation caused by the noise around wind farms can effect certain individuals. (9). I would like to emphasize the CERTAIN. Again from my opponents evidence,"" Scientists dismissed the idea of a ""wind turbine syndrome"" where the vibrations in the air or the particular sound waves from wind turbines cause headaches, nausea and panic attacks. (9). His evidence as far as wind turbine syndrome is contradictory and therefore must not be considered in this debate. ""The Government insisted that wind farms do not have a direct impact on health.""(9). If stress is the only side effect and you deem it to be reason enough not to build wind turbines, by the same reasoning stress alone is reason enough to not get married, to not go to school, to not have a social life. Stress can be caused by anything and everything."" Concerning weather. I would like to point out at this time that nuclear power plants are also susceptible to mother natures wrath. The Fukushima disaster was caused by a tsunami. I beleive majority of you will agree with me if I say a nuclear power plant being destroyed is more dangerous than a few fires."" Concerning cost efficiency. The article that states the cost of wind vs fossil fuels has no author or date to be seen. For that reason I will dismiss evidence number 21 as unreliable. My opponent also states the words of George Taylor, saying that the cost could be higher due to hidden costs. I would like to point out my opponent never says exactly what these hidden costs could include. That makes this argument questionable in its logic. Concerning fuel poverty. My opponents main argument in this revolved around the fact that wind energy did not create enough jobs, which caused deaths. Again I will direct you attention back to my paragraph concerning job creation, which talks about how many jobs wind creates, as well as provides a small portion of the types of jobs."" 1""http://epa.gov... 2""http://www.edf.org... 3""http://www.mass.gov... 4 http://mobile.bloomberg.com... 5 http://www.nei.org... 6""http://nextbigfuture.com... 7""http://windhse.org... 8""http://www.noblepower.com... 9""http://www.telegraph.co.uk..."

[[http://www.ieer.org/ensec/no-1/glbnrg.html]] Nuclear power plants are far more gross-land efficient than both fossil-fuel plants and hydro-electric plants and have much potential to expand throughout the world. Moreover, experts predict that nuclear energy will be a sustainable source for 30,000-60,000 years. It is also expected that energy security will be considerably reliable considering the widely available 16million metric tons of uranium.

S7729e8b4-A6ffdef46	Being the only realistic alternative to fossil fuel energy, expansion of the technology must be available through trade.	The very fact that nuclear energy is the only feasible alternative that can contribute a large bulk of the world’s demand makes its expansion imperative. In contrast to the affirmative’s “belief”, the opposition stresses that banning nuclear reactor technology strains the development and expansion of a critically important resource. While team affirmative contradicts itself by having stated strict standards impair development then suggesting nations should develop such technologies for themselves, team opposition recognizes that first, many nations do not have the power to develop the technology for themselves or to develop the technology fast enough to allow for a gradual and safe transition into alternative energy sources. Many developing nations must depend on the trade of such technologies for it to either be available to them or open possibilities of market entry the way economies such as South Korea have done with IT industries. In other words, trade allows for underdeveloped countries, where the technology is unavailable domestically, to access such technology. As for developing countries, a cheaper domestic alternative can be developed based on versions present in the market both dropping prices in the international market and increasing energy security, but as history shows, this only works as well as it can if the technology is readily available on the market. Secondly, team affirmative have introduced a counter argument regarding what we have disproved directly before. Again, we have stressed that alternative sources like solar or wind energy alone will not satisfy global energy demand. Even in the case that these technologies are developed enough in certain countries, they will be strictly geographically limited. Because of this inherent factor, such alternative energy sources will neither be universally applicable nor reliable. Therefore, such factors enforce the necessity of keeping nuclear technology available through trade.	PRO	126

Se452ca97-Ab9b398bb	Looking to the future, we should fund Nuclear energy rather than Wind energy.	2nd Rebuttal Counter-argument #1: The amount of steel and concrete wind turbines use Increasing the size of both the turbine and the rotor could prove to be a very successful idea. Increasing the turbine about 100 to 140 meters could increase the energy capacity of the wind turbine by 40-50%. This is due to the fact that the higher up the turbine is, the more steady and consistent the wind speeds are. Increasing the size of the turbine would also decrease the amount of bird deaths due to the fact that less birds fly that high. Also, the increased rotor size dramatically improves the turbines efficiency as shown is round 2. Also, increasing the height would result is using 15% less steel than the modern day turbine uses and 40% less bolted connections. This would be less harmful for the environment, less expensive, and make the turbine easier to maintain [1]. All of these statistics go against my opponents claim that increased rotor size would be overall detrimental. Counter-argument #2: The problems of offshore wind turbines I would just like to make it clear that I did not drop the four impracticalities of offshore wind turbines as my opponent suggested because this is the very round were I am supposed to rebut his original rebuttal. Before I begin with the rebuttals of my opponents four impracticalities, it is important to know that offshore wind turbines are hardly a commercial product as of now. Currently offshore turbines are in the experimentation stage, and are about 15 years from being competitive with fossil fuels, according to a Danish energy company [2]. Therefore, while my opponents arguments are true that there are multiple problems with offshore wind turbines, they are currently being improved on. Counter-argument #1: Faulty Foundations Faulty foundations would only be a problem for offshore turbines that are installed onto the ocean floor. However, I was arguing more for floating turbines, which quite literally float on the surface. However, in order to prevent corrosion, many companies have began using remote monitoring to detect whether the turbine requires repairs or not. This method has been proven to work as it is currently being used in the fossil fuels industry consistently [3]. Counter-argument #2: They rot into the sea This argument is similar to the first argument, and my rebuttal will be similar as well. Using remote monitoring, it can be detected if a turbine is corroding or not. If it is, then it can be easily repaired and there will be little to no environmental impact. Counter-argument #3: The change in sea currents Current obstruction would only be a problem if the company installing the turbines did so illegally. Currently there are many guidelines such as the IEC 61400-3 and independent country regulations that require companies to report where they will install their turbines [4]. Counter-argument #4: The damage done to natural carbon sinks Again, this issue can be resolved if there were more regulations as of where turbines can be installed. Also, the usage of floating turbines gets another point due to the fact that it would not damage the carbon sinks because they are not installed into the sea floor. Counter-argument #3: Even considering bladeless wind turbines, nuclear is still more cost-efficient and in most cases even cheaper. Again, I must show to my opponent that my argument is not that bladeless turbines are currently superior to nuclear energy, because they are not. However I am arguing that bladeless turbines have massive potential. This is due to the fact that bladeless turbines haven't even had a commercial launch yet and they have already shown to have a energy capacity of around 80%. Once bladeless turbines begin to take hold, the price will inevitably drop as shown in the third round. Counter-argument #4: Advances in wind/nuclear energy Contrary to what my opponent, I have provided several examples for how wind energy has improved over the past decade. Such as: Increased energy capacity due to: Increased rotor size. Increased turbine size. New ideas such as: Bladeless turbines Offshore turbines. Floating turbines. Decreased prices due to: increased usage of turbines. Overall superior turbine models. Increased safety due to: Taller turbines resulting in less bird deaths. Turbines only catching fire 0.0012% of the time. Also, my has not provided any examples as of how nuclear energy has improved over the past decade, only stating the current statistics about nuclear energy. This means that nuclear energy is not worthy of further funding because an increase in money would not increase efficiency of nuclear energy. However, wind energy has shown several advancements in the past decade therefore making it obvious that only more advancements would come with increased funding. Closing Statement My opponent has consistently ignored my argument stating that wind energy has higher potential than nuclear energy. I have shown that wind energy has made several huge advancements in the past decade while nuclear energy has provided none. I have also shown that wind energy is far safer than nuclear energy, as the only detriment against wind energy is that it very rarely catches fire while nuclear energy has the potential of a massive disaster and overall increases cases of cancer and leukemia.

Yet, why not just exploit the sun's energy directly with photovoltaic cells? This is more efficient.	PRO	129
Se452ca97-A8a473ef8	Looking to the future, we should fund Nuclear energy rather than Wind energy.	"My argument is: A: Wind Energy shows greater potential than Nuclear Energy and has made many technological advances than nuclear energy has over the past decade or so. Let's begin... 1: Wind Turbines have increased their energy capacity dramatically. Over the past decade wind turbines have increased their energy capacity (the amount of energy that can be produced and stored) from 25% to over 50%. This is a drastic change due to increased rotor sizes from the original 70 meter rotors to rotors over 100 meters. The greater the size of the rotor, the more energy can be produced, and therefore increases its energy capacity. Also, with greater rotor sizes, wind turbines are able to produce energy even when the wind is not blowing hard, therefore allowing wind turbines to be built in many more places [1]. 2: Increased usage of offshore turbines. While onshore turbines are still the more efficient and popular form of wind turbines, offshore wind turbines have improved dramatically over the past ten years. Offshore turbines are so promising due to the fact that, if successful, we could install wind turbines throughout the entire ocean, which makes up 70% of the Earth. This would increase energy productions and help replace usage of fossil fuels. Some examples of advancements of offshore turbines can be found in GE's Halidade 150. The Halidade 150 has an enormous 150 meter rotor size yet is also being improved on to become lighter and more efficient. Another type of offshore turbine is called a ""floating turbine"". Floating turbines are a relatively new idea and are currently in the testing stage, however they have great potential because it allows countries or companies to install turbines without securing them underwater, and as a result would be able to install turbines in deep sea, which consists of over 65% of the earth [2]. Floating Turbines: 3: Bladeless turbine shows great promise and could replace the current form of wind turbines. One very young, yet very promising idea in the advance in wind energy technology comes from a Tunisian scientist named Anis Aouini. Aouini proposed a prototype for a wind turbine that does not have any blades, and rather has a circular shape, called the Saphonian. What makes the Saphonian so innovative is that it has over an 80% energy capacity rate (almost 30% greater than current turbines and approximately equal to what nuclear energy produces). Also, according to Aouini it costs almost ""...half as much to make"" than current wind turbines [3]. 4: Limited advances in Nuclear Energy Nuclear Energy currently has shown that it produces more energy at a better rate than wind energy. However, there has not been many advances in nuclear energy over the past decade. For example, Graph A shows that nuclear energy made great strides in the first twenty years of its developments by increasing its energy capacity. However, in the past decade the energy capacity has remained constant at about 80%, inferring that advancements in nuclear technology have stalled. Graph A: Conclusion: Wind energy has made great advances in the past decade and should further benefit from increased funding. Nuclear energy, on the other hand, is currently productive, however has not made significant advances in the past decade to deserve increased funding."	CON	130
S53275be8-Aa544b6cd	Alternative renewables are inefficient for the cost	"Nuclear power is the most practical renewable energy source as all the others face major difficulties either in scaling up to provide enough to be a major component of nations energy mix, don't provide energy all the time, the 'base load', or cause other environmental problems. Nuclear is a proven technology with large firms that can build large amounts of nuclear energy generation capacity. The most efficient source of renewable energy has been hydroelectric power, however, this usually creates more problems than it solves. Building a large dam necessarily floods an enormous region behind the dam which in turn can displace thousands of people. There are also enormous ecological costs to dam building. A classical example is the Aswan dam in Egypt along the Nile. Not only did many thousands lose their homes but the yearly inundation of the Nile, which fertilised the surrounding land for thousands of year, was also stopped; the subsequent silting up of the river destroyed much wildlife1. A similar story of ecological destruction and human homelessness surrounded the more recent Three Gorges dam project in China2. Wind, tidal, and solar power are all affected by issues of reliability. The tendency of wind power, in particular, to be a volatile source of energy, means that other power sources such as fossil fuel power stations have to make up the shortfall when wind levels drop. Tidal power technology is still in at an early stage and may take years to become profitable. It also has the potential to cause environmental problems in the marine environment. For a large area of the European Union, there is not the potential to exploit solar power as there are not enough hours of sunlight. ""Wind and solar power have their place, but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply can't replace big baseload plants such as coal, nuclear and hydroelectric. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is too expensive already, and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants.

Sd3d77219-Abcd8e5ca	the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels	My opponents argument is essentially this: 1. We need ‘green’ energy 2. Governments will lead us down a greener path faster 3. Therefore, we need government intervention in order for green energy to reign supreme However, the basic premises behind this argument are fatally flawed. 1. We need ‘green’ energy This is the basic foundation behind my opponents assertion. Conventional methods of energy (fossil fuels, nuclear) are the ‘dirty’ evil energy sources whereas the alternative energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) being efficient alternatives. Further, her argument relies on the fact that these pollutants are actually going to significantly harm the environment. Lets talk about these conventional sources. Natural Gas: Natural Gas is the second most clean conventional energy source (behind Nuclear). Natural Gas emits 117,000 pounds of CO2 emissions per btu of energy, compared to oil (164,000) and Coal (208,000). Further, natural gas is much more efficient than coal. 90% of natural gas produced is energy used by the public, whereas the number for other conventional forms of energy is about 30%. The market, at this stage, is moving towards Natural Gas. Even assuming that climate change and pollution is a major issue, a switch from coal to gas will lead to a huge reduction in pollution [1]. The Wall Street Journal writes, “U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically in recent years, in large part because the country is making more electricity with natural gas instead of coal. Energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is widely believed to contribute to global warming, have fallen 12% between 2005 and 2012 … many experts believe the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation has been the biggest factor [in CO2 emission reduction].”[2] Coal: Coal is the dirtiest form of energy which is commonly used, however, the fact is that coal actually works to save lives in aggregate, not decrease longevity. Energy is one of the most important things humans have. It gives us warmth, it gives us cold, it gives us electricity, computers, phones, cooking equipment, etc. For poor people, energy is a matter of life and death. The cheaper it is, the more access these people have, and the longer lives they live. The question is whether or not coal’s pollution factor outweighs the health benefits of pollution. Researchers have found that if we take coal out of the energy equation, 150,000 people would die--for the government to restrict coal (a form of supporting alternative energy) and then promote expensive alternatives would lead to deaths, and a destruction of human life--not benefiting it. Another study argues that coal prevents 14,000-15,000 premature deaths in the US each year. Further, in countries with more energy consumption per capita (increases if energy is cheaper), human development is much higher [3]. Nuclear: Nuclear power is the cleanest, and one of the cheapest, forms of energy on the planet, and is considered ‘conventional’. In the United States, Nuclear was cheaper than all the other common energy types, including one of the cheapest, coal. Oh, and Gas is also pretty cheap too [4]. The fact is, if the government should be involved in anything, it should be nuclear. Nuclear is clean, cheap, and efficient. In fact, it is seen by many environmentalists that Nuclear is the energy source of the future, it is the way to prevent ‘climate change’. Nuclear is superior because renewable energy is intermittent: we will need a backup power plant to power us when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn’t blowing. A few options: use batteries, inefficient and not ‘green’ for disposal, or another power plant, probably natural gas or coal. In either scenario, alternative energies will not be able to sustain us alone. As Mark Perry writes, “To use more wind and solar increases the need for backup power, and the associated emissions that come with it will largely cancel out any emissions savings from renewables.”[5] Nuclear, on the other hand, is always working as long as it is being run properly. It could easily provide for all of our energy needs. Also, James Hansen--known for his rampant environmentalist fervor--co-authored a study saying that nuclear is ESSENTIAL to our future, and that it has saved 1.8 million lives [6]. Solar: As stated, solar is an intermittent source of energy, and when the sun isn't shining, the carbon savings will be washed out by the very cheap, reliable, conventional energy source having to fill in the gaps. Not to mention, it costs a lot. Solar power costs 20 cents per killowatt hour, compared to about two cents for coal [7]. Remember what I said? Expensive energy kills poor people. Wind: There is zero scientific proof that wind reduces CO2 emissions, according to the Ways and Means committee. They argue that CO2 savings will be minimal, and will look like nothing compared to the conventional nuclear power option [8]. Hydro: The fact is, hydroelectric power is dirty. Newscientist refutes hydropower’s fans, saying “Hydroelectric dams produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, and in some cases produce more of these greenhouse gases than power plants running on fossil fuels,”[9]. 2. Governments need to make us green! This premise is also flawed--the fact is, the free market will opt for the most efficient energy source. At this point, natural gas is the favored option--and as stated, it is cheap and clean. It will increase life spans, keep energy cheap, and ‘save the planet’, if you like that sort of thing. And in the foreseeable future, it is likely that nuclear will emerge as a key player in energy. And, thats a good thing. But this premise begs the question--do we even want to go green? The simple fact is, carbon dioxide is beneficial to the biosphere, and is a necessary component to life [10]. Further, there is significant peer reviewed evidence that climate change will not harm humanity, and in fact may benefit our existence [11]. There is even literature arguing that the link between CO2 and temperature is weak, exaggerated, or even nonexistent [12]. Other than the fact conventional ‘pollutants’ are likely beneficial with no strong proof of harm, overall air pollution in the United States is falling, and is expected to continue decreasing [13]. Therefore, this premise, too, is flawed. 3. Therefore, government needs to support alternative energy I deduce that this conclusion is false based on my above reasoning. Alternative energy sources are expensive and inefficient, whereas conventional sources are cheap, economically viable, and in many cases, clean. 1. http://www.aga.org... 2. http://online.wsj.com... 3. https://www.advancedenergyforlife.com... 4. http://www.nei.org... 5. http://news.investors.com... 6. http://blogs.scientificamerican.com... 7. http://www.businessinsider.com... 8. http://waysandmeans.house.gov... 9. http://www.newscientist.com... 10. http://www.co2science.org... 11. http://www.co2science.org... 12. http://www.co2science.org... 13. http://www.ncpa.org...

The body may choose the best proposal to take up the task. NASA is an inefficient choice because: 1)They are behind the private sector because they have yet to have an existing project. 2)Restricting the options for companies to just NASA defeats allocative and technical efficiency. Giving the project to the private sector would allow for greater economic growth given the rise in GDP, employment expansion, and because of the elevated involvement in the market that a qualified company may hold.

Sf4c49f83-A4018495a	Nuclear power is beneficial for society	"First, I thank my opponent for this topic. I would like to first point out that my opponent only gives one point for why nuclear power is good for society, thus I only need respond to that argument. So first, in refutation of my opponent's argument, I would like to point out that even if solar and wind energy doesn't have enough power to power a nation, hydro power certainly has that potential. Even more, hydropower combined with solar and wind power would definitely be enough to power a country such as the United States. Hydro power has been shown to work through the Hoover Dam, which has been constantly been giving power to the west coast since it was built. http://www.enviro-news.com... Secondly, my plan to use hydro, solar and wind energy allows for the minimal changing of the environment and also uses energy that is MOST naturally found in nature today. Also, there is no chance that these types of energy could in any way have the potential of hurting citizens. Even though my opponent says that there is no radiation risk, it can be seen that there is a chance that there could be a radiation leak because of how much we still have to research about nuclear energy. Even a slight radiation leak could cause catastrophic casualties to citizens. Thus, with the use of hydro, solar and wind energy, there is minimal change to the environment, no chance of hurting citizens and these energies are the easiest to use, which leads me to my third argument. Thirdly, since hydro, solar and wind energy are the easiest to ""capture"" and transform into usable energy, meaning that most countries, instead of nuclear capable countries, would be able to use this energy for the wellbeing of their citizens. Lastly, my opponent does not give any reasons why such nuclear technology could not be stolen and turned into a potential nuclear weapon. This might seem like a stretch but the same technology used to generate power could also be used to make weapons of destruction. This technology could either by stolen by countries or terrorists; or could be potentially given into enemies who use the technology to destroy each other. This is just an extrapolation of nuclear energy use, but is very viable when we look to Iran or North Korea. I now stand ready for further refutation."	CON	139

Sb4dd798f-Aa9b6c656	Nuclear Energy	"thank you for this debate my good man. definitions: Nuclear power source: nuclear power plant, C1 - Location - One cannot account nor predetermine what kind of weather patterns will change due to global warming. Location is the biggest issue with a nuclear power plant. You can't place it anywhere where there is a high risk place like natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.). The power plant cannot be placed in any urban area due one simply needs to see japan to now why or Chernobyl but even then a spill can contaminate for miles in any direction. Furthermore We are still fighting a ""war on terror"" this makes nuclear power plant high risk. So the power plant cannot be built anywhere in the coasts or near faults or in high density areas that leaves the rural areas however it cannot be placed there either because if there is a spill the people there loose their source of income and maybe thier lives due to human error. C2 -cost- nuclear power plant construction costs—mainly materials, labor, and engineering—rose by 185 percent between 2000 and 2007. More recently, costs have been increasing even faster: In mid-March, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 1,100 MW nuclear plants it intends to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, which ""triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago."" Jim Harding, former director of power planning and forecasting for Seattle City Light, estimates that nuclear plants constructed today would provide electricity at between 12 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. To put this cost into perspective, the average U.S. electricity price in 2006 was 8.9 cents per kWh, and well-placed wind turbines can produce electricity for less than 5 cents per kWh. So nuclear power actally costs more than wind or water power. C3 - investment - Subsidies for nuclear reactors wouldn't subsidize nuclear technology—they would subsidize the nuclear industry. Congress should fund research of clean, alternative energy technologies that promise to rival fossil fuels in cost—without subsidies. Congress should also provide tax credits that would make such technologies cheaper by encouraging production and moving them down the experience curve. Such support would encourage a growing American industry and create American jobs. By squandering our limited resources on subsidies for the nuclear power industry, the United States is missing an extraordinary opportunity. C4 - Waste - Where is all the waste going to go? nuclear power generates toxic waste never mind that america hasn't really built one in over thirty years and never mind that japan steel is the only company which produces the central part of a nuclear reactor containment vessel. All the waste generated by uranium/plutonium ( and we don't have vry much uranium so availability is also a problem) will go in big containers and be buried in the earth which is sort of ironic because nuclear energy is supposedly clean. Conclusion: The united states federal gov't should not invest in nuclear power sources because of lack of understanding nuclear power plants, there is no viable location of where to put nuclear reactors, They would be high risk targets for terrorists, an investment in them would not be wise, and there would be a generation of waste and the availability of uranium is another problem as well.

Institute for Energy Research. 11 Jul. 2008 - ""Wind energy needs backup power that comes mostly from natural-gas fired power plants...Because wind is intermittent and unreliable, new wind generation requires the building of backup electrical generation. Most commonly, backup generation is provided by natural gas-fired power plants. Unlike coal or nuclear power, which can literally take days to heat boilers up to the appropriate temperature, natural gas turbines can spin up and produce electricity very quickly. Thus, the federal government should open new areas for natural gas production to meet growing demand for power, just the opposite of what the Pickens Plan espouses (“this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of”)."""

Sb4dd79ae-Acc562917	Nuclear Energy	"I will begin with my opponent's case and then present an alternative to nuclear energy. Opening statement: My opponent has produced some very impressive data on the efficiency of nuclear energy. Prima facie or first glance could easily sway a person to support nuclear energy. I vaguely recall having done rudimentary research on nuclear energy for a Lincoln-Douglas topic last fall. In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few ""what if"" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many ""experts"" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators. Thank you!"	CON	145

Debate Outline Round 1 I Brief intro introduction to Nuclear Energy II The energy situation as it is now, and where it's going III Where does Nuclear fit in Round 2 IV GODZILLA!!! V Proliferation Round 3 VI Cool new technologies VII Humans in space I. Brief intro introduction to Nuclear Energy Just what are we talking about? Nuclear is very vague, everything about atoms is nuclear. Well, generally when we talk nuclear energy we are speaking of fission (splitting the atom) fusion (fusion of two nuclei) and decay (energy ionizing radiation). Each of these has reasonable visuals to differentiate in our minds. Weather fission, fusion, or decay, what we are looking at is energy released from the nucleus of an atom. Thanks in large part to a kindly man with shocking white hair we have been able to realize the awesome power that sits all around us, and he expressed it with only a hand full of characters - E=mc^2. Reasonably speaking, our entire universe is running on nuclear energy. Solar, wind, coal, these and every other imaginable power source is in effect drafting on nuclear energy. If you believe that (and you should, because it's true) how do we make power like the cool kids do? Electricity through nuclear energy is produced in the same way as it we do it by burning coal, oil or natural gas. When burnt, the heat formed produces steam. The steam then turns turbines. The turbines turns generators which produce electricity. The difference between the plants that use coal and the plants that use uranium as fuel is that nuclear plants don't burn anything, and don't produce CO2 - the major cause of global warming, and with a energy densities 3 million times that of coal!(MJ/kg Uranium - 80,620,000 coal - 24)![1.1] References: * Image created by TBR from original work licensed under Public Domain; II. The energy situation as it is now, and where it's going The story of energy consumption is a story of good news mixed with bad news. Our human endears are producing marvels of technical glory, the bad news is, this comes at a cost - the enviroment. We need to address the bad news in order to continue to enjoy the good news. The typical American household is consuming ~11,700 kWh/year[2.1]. That is a dramatic number when compared with some other first world countries like China who typically use ~1,350 kWh/year[2.1]. The good news is, even with more electricity consuming devices being added to the typical household, generally speaking use is going DOWN in the first world due in large part to more efficient and smarter technologies. The bad news is the US household (population) has never gone down. We are adding households[2.2] that each use ~11,500 kWh/year! We can't efficiency our way out of this problem. The first world is not alone in its lust for electricity. When we look at this list of countries, and the percentage of the population with access to electricity, we get an average of 75% of the population with access to electric[2.3]. These percentages have been going UP for some time. That is, more and more people are getting access to the electricity they need and want. However, that still leaves, according to world energy outlook[2.4], about 1.317 billion people on the planet without electricity, and virtually every sign points to the fact that they want and need electricity! We are not the only ones that need electricity. In the US, and throughout the world, electric vehicles are becoming more mainstream. Displacing the fossil fuel directly consumed is a great start. Unfortunately, we need to generate the power to fuel the electric cars we have now, and the ones that will eventually replace almost, if not all, autos on the road today. A guesstimate of the electricity needed to replace fossil fuel for the cars on the road today is 1,111 TWh! The total electric consumption for the US in 2011 was 3,882 TWh, making for an approximate 29% increase necessary to power all cars by electricity[2.5]. Moving the problem around does not solve the problem. The US and the world is using a whole lot of electricity, and is on track to need much-much more.

Image created by TBR from original work created by; http://science.howstuffworks.com... http://www.worldbank.org... III. Where does Nuclear fit in The goals are simple enough. Provide ample electricity to cover the current needs, our growing needs, and the needs of those without access to reliable electricity now, and do it all without digging our pollution hole even deeper. Simple enough, that's only ~143,851 TWh per year now, with a 10% increase of use per person worldwide, and population growth 27%[3.1]. Wait, what did I just say? With the current distribution of technologies looking a little like this[3.2] Coal 42% Natural Gas 20% Hydro 16% Nuclear 14% Oil-based 5% Renewables(all).. 3% Is it feasible to hope to eliminate even just coal any time soon, let alone expect renewables to cover the bulk of the current load, forgetting the understood growth? If we could, is it the smartest approach? May answer to each of these questions is, no. When you look at the incredible growth rates in solar and wind over the last five to ten years, it might give you hope that these industries could do the incredible. Replace coal, nuclear, maybe even natural gas. The problem with growth rates is the next year that triple growth you had last year is the new base for this year! An attempt to maintain even a modest growth rate year-over-year is incredibly difficult regardless of desire and acceptance. Another simple problem is, like any industry, the wind and solar utilities have targeted the best locations first - leaving the more difficult for tomorrow. Locations with little to no infrastructure, access to the grid, less desirable for technical reasons like less wind, or less sun. The necessary growth needed is simply too tall a request for wind and solar to accomplish alone, and certainly unnecessary handcuffing efforts whan another mature technology with lower CO2 emission is right at hand. What, what? Thats not a typo[3.3], for total life-cycle, nuclear beats both wind and solar for CO2 emission. Nuclear is the only feasible baseload alternative to coal. Solar and wind can be layered along with other technologies to accomplish reliable baseload for some areas, but this compounds problems for even sophisticated countries let alone the developing world where the choice is more likely either or. In countries where a good deal of growth of power plants will be, the choice of complex layering over the relatively simple and cost effective nuclear plant will be more attractive, and much better than coal.

S7ae7b591-Acaa71fac	Wind energy is unreliable and provides only an irregular source of supply – and even then only in some countries	Wind will only ever be a useful additional technology to provide extra capacity at time of high demand. We know it to be both unreliable and unpredictable. We know that unreliable technologies are fraught with expensive difficulties. As a result relying on such a technology would be reckless. To take one example, the only way of building in a capacity for wind into a regular energy network would require the construction of ‘battery capacity’ such as hydro-power. Developing such a capacity would be both hugely expensive and unreliable – it’s useful if the wind fails to blow for a few hours, if the doldrums last for a few days, then everything grinds to a halt.

See0f4916-Acd52db9f	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"I suppose in a world where irresponsible spending is allowed and encouraged, then we can ""substantially increase"" anything we want. But since no responsible parents will teach their kids to max out all credit cards without reasonable plan for repayment, such economical trade-off must occur. Even if my opponent practices such irresponsible financial planning himself, I hope the voters can maintain better credit scores. Since my opponent has simply built his arguments around my contentions, I shall defend them and continuing pointing my opponent's inability to see the fundamental issue at core. Firstly, it is clear that my opponent has only focused on increase spending in Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) development alone rather than increasing substantial incentives to the alternative energy industry as a whole. Therefore, his burden of proof lies within providing justification to provide incentives to the whole industry rather than any singular project. Although I agree to many projected benefits of IFR development, the real problem is whether the federal government is allocating its LIMITED RESOURCES in the most effective and efficient manner by increasing alternative energy incentive to the whole industry. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act increased funding for nuclear, wind power, and various other initiatives. All projects reported positive projections yet many are now inactive. Regardless of whether IFR can actually save the day, the core question is whether the government should once again divert its limited resources toward another ""positive projection"" at the cost of the American taxpayers. Secondly, since we disagree on whether the government has unlimited ability to spend, I shall maintain the position of responsible spending and continue my analysis of various trade-offs. Although you may admire my opponent's number crunching ability, you should also note that he maintains a ""IFR is only small money. If the rest of the nation's balance sheet is already crap, why not spend just a little more?"" The problem, however, is not the cost of IFR relative to the rest of our deficit schedule. My opponent continues to justify substantial incentive increase to the alternative energy in part or in whole! As a proxy to the will of the American people, the government has the responsibility to spend money only on projects which have already gathered significant public interest. Any diversion of funding toward minor pet projects of the congress or special interest group is a betrayal to the responsibility of legislators to represent the will of their constituents. Without evidence of the public interest comparison to those for education, welfare, defense, and healthcare, the federal government does not have the constitutional right to put my money into one of her pet projects no matter how small it may be. Lastly, I agree that free market may not be a cure-all solution. Government interventions are sometimes necessary for the welfare of the general public. But plenty of long-term innovations have been developed in the private sector, and the opinion of one man is hardly a sufficient reason to violate the cardinal of free competition. I agree that the government should establish protection measures such as preventing future dumping at Yucca Mountain. To invest in a competing technology, however, is establishing a nationalized entity with unlimited national resources to compete in a supposedly open market. And if federal subsidies is not the BEST method of reaching alternative energy, then why should we increase federal alternative energy incentives when other BETTER methods can be implemented? I completely agree that the society as a whole should pay more attention to the issue of energy crisis. However, the topic specifically asks for federal government initiatives and it is clear that the popular concerns reside in other more prominent issues. It may be proper for the government to promote private sector involvement without diversion of resources from other programs or printing more money. But it is constitutionally wrong to allocate resources toward projects which do not reflect the majority will of the people of the United States."	CON	149

Sf074f79e-A61bc1a6f	Nuclear Power	"I will agree to my opponents wishes and confine my arguments to the subject of large scale nuclear power facilities, but am still unclear as to his overall resolution. Even taking this into consideration, his opening statement is still ""I would like to argue that Large Scale Nuclear Power Facilities, which have been largely underrated due to events such as Chernobyl, is detrimental to the environment more so than the danger radioactive substances."" This continues to make no sense. 1. I am having trouble fully understanding the argument being put forward here due to improper syntax. To be blunt, your sentence structure is nonsensical in some areas, and my apologies if I misinterpret your meaning in some cases. I'll do my best. For starters, I am not holding that nuclear power and its by products are one and the same, quite the opposite. There is of course a difference between the scientific theory behind a technology, the actual application of theory to a technology, and the physical manifestations of that technology, I don't think anyone is arguing to the contrary. Pro then argues in favor of his position by stating that environmental impact from fossil fuel production and consumption is greater than that caused by nuclear power. While this may be the case, I fail to see the relevance of that statement. No where in the resolution, or anywhere else in Pro's opening statement, does it require that it must be proved that fossil fuels are less environmentally detrimental than nuclear power. That is to say, we are not debating the merits of nuclear energy by contrasting them with fossil fuels exclusively, and I am by no means required to prove the invalidity of nuclear power as a fuel source by upholding the validity of fossil fuels. As to his closing statement in this section, I believe the confusion rests with Pro, in his interpretation of my statement regarding the idea of nuclear technology. I was not holding the viewpoint that nuclear technology exists only as an abstract idea. That would be silly. What IS silly is Pro's assertion that because nuclear technology has been in practice for more than 60 years, it is no longer an idea. He fails to recognize that an idea doesn't disappear because you put it into practice, it doesn't 'cease to exist' as an idea. Pro as completely missed the point of my statement and misinterpreted it about as much as one could. The only reason I even felt I had to delve into such abstract lines of logic was to make sense of his nonsensical opening statement in the first place. His final argument is that the power which can be produced from a nuclear reactor is worth producing the radioactive waste. He makes no support to this statement, just the statement. I will counter it with a statement of my own. No it's not. 2. This section seems to consist mainly of Pro taking liberties and making assumptions that he's not allowed to make. In his first statement, he agrees to cede the point if I can show multiple instances where nuclear power has caused 'global damage.' He then conveniently excludes Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, as if to say because he knows about them and they are commonly recognized, they are somehow invalid in this argument. He further marginalizes legitimate nuclear disasters by stating that monetary damage alone is commonplace, again referencing the fossil fuel industry for similar incidents (again, I'm not contrasting Nuclear Power with Fossil Fuels exclusively, so I feel no compulsion to use it as a measuring stick in this debate.) Pro also fails to recognize that monetary damage implies economic damage, and 'global damage' is not simply confined to the environment, there is 'global economic damage' as well. As the resolution does not specify what type of global damage we are to consider, we must consider all forms of global damage as legitimate. I hold that Nuclear Power has caused over 20 billion dollars in property damage alone from 1952-2009, and thus I prove my point that it does not have an ""otherwise safe history"", as held by Pro. You must vote Con on this point alone. As to his attempts to preempt of any reference to the Japan disaster by reason of claiming the damage caused was not inherent to nuclear power specifically, but rather to an act of God, I refuse to validate such a thoroughly illogical claim. The propensity of a nuclear reactor to cause damage if compromised is directly relevant to its inherent safety and must be considered when evaluating the technology as a whole. If I invented a source of power that ran on peanut oil, but my Peanut Oil Reactor could detonate and irradiate several square miles if it got hit with a snowstorm (act of God), I could hardly be justified in calling my Peanut Oil Reactor 'safe.' Conversely, if I put a wind power generator on a hill, and it gets hit by an earthquake, the wind power generator doesn't explode and cause radiation. Therefore, the nuclear reactor by its very presence has caused nuclear damage in the Japan disaster, and I refuse to accept your invalid and illogical dismissal of it. Pro has clearly failed to demonstrate that nuclear power has 'otherwise a safe history' and thus this point must be given to Con. 3. My opponent here tries to construct a series of criteria which I must meet with my argument in order to win this point. He states that for a technology to even be allowed to be considered as meeting this criteria, it must be able to produce energy comparable to that of a nuclear reactor. My opponent fails to put forth any other requirements, such as cost, or area required to construct, so I hold that even wind power, given unlimited funding and space, can produce enough power to meet this criteria. Even if it takes wind farm the size of Kentucky to produce as much power as one nuclear plant, this point will have been won by Con, as it shows a source of power that is less 'polluting' than nuclear energy. Again, this is just ONE alternative fuel source, there is still hydroelectricity, bio fuels, liquid-hydrogen, solar power, kinetic generation, and others. If my opponent is attempting to claim that nuclear power is definitively safer and cheaper than every one of those technologies, then he has a hard road ahead of him. In summary, since my opponent has not further clarified his Resolution or initial points, we must rely on the list I supplied in round 1 for the criteria with which to judge victory. The points are as follows: 1(amended). Large Scale Nuclear Power Facilities have been demonized due to events like Chernobyl, and are in actuality more dangerous than radioactive isotopes produced by Nuclear reactors. This point continues to be absurd, and will be so until Pro defines it more clearly. As of now, it must be considered a point for Con as it contradicts itself. 2. Other than producing dangerous radioactive waste as a by product, nuclear power has had an otherwise safe history. I have clearly proved that this is not the case. I only needed to show one example where nuclear power has been demonstrably unsafe, other than in the normal operation of a reactor, and I have clearly done so. Point to Con. 3. When compared to other conventional fuel sources, Nuclear power causes less pollution. I have rejected Pro's inference that I must, as Con, attempt to defend fossil fuels. He makes no reference to that requirement in the Resolution or opening statement, and I do not recognize my need to do so. I have provided several alternative power sources that would qualify as 'conventional' (solar, hydroelectric, wind, bio fuel) that all produce less pollution than nuclear power. All points must therefore go to Con!"	CON	152

S66699e25-Abb30f95	Nuclear power presents the only viable option for reducing CO2 output	Ok, so you've decided to utilize both traditional uranium fuel supplies, then you moved onto thorium nuclear energy, and now fusion energy... cool. Firstly, i would like to point out that ITER does not solve, it would take another 30 years to develop safe and affordable fusion energy, might i mention that Global warming needs to reversed now in order to end the negative effects of climate change. You have cited economic statistics on the negative impacts of climate change which i agree with. The fact is, ITER is not even functioning, merely it is a concept. Fusion energy has yet to create a net positive creation of electricity. Even if ITER works within the next couple years, it would take another decade to refine the theoretic concept and make it safer and more efficient for the public, then take another couple years to make these plants that would cost millions of dollars. Fusion energy has not even opened a single power plant that works and puts energy into our system. By 2050, which is when Fusion energy should be up and ready, Global warming would most likely have taken nasty destructive effects. Fission energy cannot solve either since Countries like the US don't want other countries to use nuclear energy(ie Iran, North Korea) therefore it cannot solve in those regions. Fusion energy will also not be trusted in other non-nuclear proliferation countries due to it's potential bomb making qualities. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Btw in your evidence for thorium reactors, it stated: Current international research and development efforts are led by China, where a $350 million MSR programme has recently been launched, with a 2MW test MSR scheduled for completion by around 2020. So essentially this technology has potential , i won't deny that. But i want to point out that the first test for this new technology will not occur until 2020. Based upon the assumptions of the time it takes for these nuclear plants to be constructed and refined, this will not be a viable source of fuel until around 2050, we cannot implement this undeveloped technology simply due to the fact that we cannot wait that long period of time and let Global warming continue to destroy our environment. India wants to do this plan and supply 30% of it's energy by 2050 but in order to solve global warming, we need a global effort and radioactive substances can't be trusted to some nations/ http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org... On climate change, i can't agree with you more. We need to take action now to prevent the destruction of the environment. This destruction is destroying aspects of our economy and the global economy. The fact is current nuclear energy can last a decade or so. By the 2030's nuclear fuels will run out and nuclear energy cannot solve until the new technological changes can power the rest which will be around 2050-2070's. The fact is, we need to act now or we will face the economic and climate catastrophes that await us since nuclear can't solve completely in this century. Therefore i propose the following plan: The World should substantially increase Solar, Wind, and other renewable energy sources to power our future. You agree that fission material will be everywhere and will cost money. net benefit - no radioactive fuel or environmental catastrophes from nuclear failures or breakdowns which bear environmental and economic costs. plus you don't have to spend millions of dollars storing all this nuclear waste, and you solve faster. Wind and solar technologies are tested. In the UK, offshore wind is set to take about 15% of the energy markets of the UK by 2020, which is only 5 years and a substantial portion of their energy. Onshore wind is now powering 4% of the US's electricity, like right now. Wind power can supply US energy by 20% by 2030 with current tax credits. The international energy agency(IEA) in 2014 estimated that solar energy can power 27% of global energy by 2050. Wind will supply another 18% of global energy. Hydro electric power will continue to be a large resource for energy producing around 15% of the worlds energy in the status quo. Here's the fact, if you don't support solar, wind, and hydro electricity, our energy future looks bleak. Sustainable nuclear energy cannot be created for another 40 years or so and until then, we need to find alternative fuel sources. Nuclear energy is not the only viable resource because it is not feasible at it's current state. Pro is arguing that in the future, Nuclear will BECOME A VIABLE source of energy. He is not arguing that it IS a viable source of energy. Vote con for solar and Wind, it will solve for around 45% of energy by 2050 and is currently solving in the UK, US, and other countries like China. The debate topic is that nuclear energy is the only option, i am arguing that alternate energy sources can solve as well. http://www.businessgreen.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.iea.org... http://www.iea.org... http://large.stanford.edu...

S6140b8cc-Abb58da8	Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)	"Pro has selected a timely topic. In this debate we will try to sort out sense from nonsense as it relates to government subsidy of energy alternatives. Micropower has virtues in certain applications. The issue is whether government ought to pour in subsidies or let the technology advance according to its usefulness and economic viability. The main thing the government can do to support the technology is to get rid of the state and local laws that forbid it by zoning and siting controls. Government should not subsidize it, because the claims for non-economic benefits are false, and government should not attempt to pick winners in economic viability. The market sorts out what is economic far better than any bureaucrat. Note that Pro did not cite a single reference supporting his assertions about the technology or our need for it. As a starting point, the Industrial Technologies Program web site is http://www1.eere.energy.gov..., but none of their claims are supported either. Pro says the status quo is unacceptable. The status quo is s successfully providing electric power to consumers. That's acceptable. If we were not getting electricity, it would be unacceptable. As with virtually anything that exists, improvements are possible. The questions have to do with the expense of improvements versus the benefits. Subsidizing micropower makes no sense in that context. Insofar as it makes economic sense, it is getting plenty of private funding. 1.a We operate on a grid system. The virtue of the grid system is that power plants can go off line, usually for maintenance, while power is continues to flow to users. 1.b.i A terrorist might take out a major transmission line, but if the grid is properly designed it will only affect a limited number of customers. The reason large areas are taken out is antiquated design so that fails to isolate transmission failures, so that power is shut down in a domino effect, rather than routed around the failure. The reason the grid is antiquated is that the regulatory structure of utilities makes it difficult to profit from upgrades on either transmission lines or improvements in control systems. Texas, for example, operates a grid that is not connected to rest of the country. They can thereby manage improvements in grid technology without the Feds stopping them. Their electricity is cheaper and more reliable than the national average. http://www.slate.com... 1.b.ii Pro cites concerns over global warming. Global warming crisis theory is now proved to be false, because measured climate data is falling below the 95% probability bounds for the models that predict climate crisis. There is warming, but it presents to substantial problem. In any case, micropower is almost entirely implemented with gas turbines, so there is no appreciable effect on CO2 emission other than the efficiency of new power plants over old. 1.b.iii Economic competitiveness requires that we not waste money on non-competitive technologies. Insofar as micropower is economically competitive or even promises to be competitive, it doesn't need government subsidy. Saying that large industries are effective is irrelevant; it's like saying we ought to subsidize the construction of stone pyramids, because the construction industry is huge and vital. 1.b.iv Micropower is readily available on the market. If the U.S. wants to buy some and give them to developing countries, our government can do that now. North Korea wants nuclear for bombs, not power generation. 1.b.v Micropower is used exclusively to generate electricity, which in the US comes from, coal, nuclear, and natural gas. There is no dependence whatsoever on foreign oil to generate electricity. We do import a little natural gas, but horizontal drilling has opened up vast new reserves of domestic natural gas, so imports will be phased out anyway. 1.c Pro provided no reference or argument to support his assertion that subsidies of fossil fuels prevents micropower from being competitive. I don't believe the claim. Since micropower is almost entirely based upon fossil fuels, natural gas in particular, the claim makes no sense. The fossil fuel industry pays way more in taxes than it receives in subsidies, so there is no net loss to the taxpayer to be remedied. 2.a As alternatives to fossil fuels, solar power requires conventional backup at night and, in many places, in winter. The backup comes from the grid. If the grid is abolished then every user will need both a conventional power generator and wind or solar, with the conventional generator idle half the time. About two-thirds of the cost of conventional power is the capital cost of the generator of the generator, not the fuel to run it. The net effect is that costs to user will at the very least double. Pro cites geothermal and hydroelectric power. Very few individuals can implement their own dam or geothermal wells. Those are inherently centralized. Consequently, if the grid is abolished hydro and thermal will be replaced with fossil fuel generators. 2.b. Pro claims subsidies to fossil fuels of $120 billion, but even biased Greenpeace ""thinks the American oil and gas industry might receive anywhere between $15 billion and $35 billion a year in subsidies from taxpayers."" In 2006, the oil companies paid $138 billion in Federal corporate tax alone. http://mjperry.blogspot.com... They pay three times their profits in taxes. Of course, coal and natural gas industries pay taxes as well, and all pay sate and local taxes in addition. Consequently, any subsidies are more than paid for. If micropower starts paying huge taxes, they might merit some subsidy, but that hasn't happened. Micropower is getting plenty of private money, so it doesn't need government subsidy. ""...serious money has come to the micropower table. Nth Power, a venture capital firm devoted to innovative energy technologies, estimates that venture capital funding for micropower and related businesses climbed from less than $30 million in 1995 to over $1 billion in 2000. Major corporations including GE, Siemens Westinghouse and the European giant, ABB, have launched efforts to develop their micropower potential..."" http://www.minneapolisfed.org... Micropower makes the most economic sense when there is a cheap source of natural gas locally. Also, semiconductor manufacturing cannot tolerate brownout or interruptions of power, so micropower makes economic sense for them. 2.c See 1.c, above. 2.d. The DOE claims that it's ITR program works. All government programs are claimed to work, no matter how much they waste. Eve so, ITR does not equate to micropower. Their projects are a hodge podge of small energy conservation projects. http://www1.eere.energy.gov... I can find no evidence of any innovation related to micropower that was sponsored by DOE. DOE is competing with venture capitalists, and VCs are going to find and push he good stuff, not DOE. 2.e. Pro claims that the subsidies could be paid by ending fossil fuel subsidies. He has provided no evidence as to what those subsidies are. Since micropower has nothing to do with oil imports, ending subsidies of domestic oil would simply increase prices and make domestic oil less competitive with foreign oil. t would result in increasing imports, something Pro agreed we do not want. Besides, any money raised could also be used to subsidize health care or reduce the federal deficit. That makes more sense than trying to compete with VCs by picking winners in micropower development. With selective subsidies by project, ITR is far more likely to screw up micropower than to help it. Pro's affirming claims are unsupported by evidence. It will have no effect on oil dependence or CO2. The resolution is negated."	CON	156

I feel as if I should apologize to the readers and voters, since my opponent isn't going to do it. I, personally, wish my opponent wouldn't have started this debate and walked away... I'd have loved to see the clash! All I ask is you vote CON. All my arguments still stand, and I believe all my points are stronger than those presented by my opponent.

Sf1a21db5-A72d295a6	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"I'll go paragraph by paragraph: INHERENCY: Inherency was dropped by negative. SOLVENCY: My first argument was really a generic argument (for clarification). You claim that I do not get solvency (which is his big argument from last speech.) Therefore I would like to use my reserved right to add evidence to prove that solvency will be reached (still on first paragraph). -From: http://www.firstscience.com... -""Nuclear power is deeply unpopular while renewable energy sources – wind, solar and tidal – yield relatively little energy for their high cost. But nuclear fusion could render carbon dioxide-producing fossil fuels obsolete by 2100."" -This quote proves two things, 1) If congress keeps cutting costs, then we will lengthen the amount of time it takes to achieve fusion power… 2) By fossil fuels running out and getting more expensive… therefore we must increase the incentives of fusion power, which is the energy of the future. -(Same Source) -""Energy production from nuclear fusion has proven an insurmountable challenge so far. Yet scientists are now saying that plans for larger and more sophisticated reactors around the world could finally make this possible in 50 years time. Is this more than just wishful thinking?"" -This proves that we can't be cutting the funding for fusion power ESPECIALLY NOW. If we substantially increase the energy incentives by increasing funding, these ""larger and more sophisticated reactors"" will be created if the plan is passed. The ITER is the head of fusion development, but the US must do its part and if Congress cuts this spending (that should be overturned and increased by passing this plan), then fusion power will only be prolonged. The question is not IF solvency will be reached, but when. The sooner this funding can go through the sooner the energy crisis can be over (because fusion power will end the crisis). This is proven by the estimates made by Chris Warrick (the UK Atomic Energy Authority) ""You need 50 megawatts of power to heat it and you should get around 5,000 megawatts out."" (Next paragraph)--> The whole argument about ""hidden agendas"" is ridiculous. The CHANCE of hidden agendas does not make adequate grounds to vote down the plan. Furthermore, you have to see that the ONLY agenda that these scientists need to stick to is the agenda of finding usable fusion energy… that's it. The fact that there is a group of people being made to create fusion energy seems to be enough to see that they are going to have the agenda of creating fusion energy. ALSO, my opponent has not offered what these other agendas could be AND how they will harm anyone. This argument carries no weight whatsoever. Solvency was proven to be met two paragraphs ago… Simply cross-apply it here. (www.fas.org argument)--> This argument does not link to ANYTHING that has to do with fusion energy. If you go to the specific website of where he got this quote, it mentions fusion energy a whopping ZERO times. Furthermore, it never says HOW MUCH water would need to be boiled AND there is no link to how this would harm society. This argument continues to carry no weight… --> First of all, the evidence mentioned has already been proven insufficient to proving anything… Furthermore, my opponent has yet to show how boiling water (still unsure about how much) can harm ANYTHING… BUT STILL, the 1 harm of boiling water can't even begin to weigh while compared to the MULTIPLE advantages listed in solvency AND the ones solved from inherency harms. SIGNIFICANCE & HARMS: --> This argument isn't topical to my plan whatsoever. This evidence deals with nuclear power plants BUT my plan calls for fusion energy which is as safe as can be (which is proven in my solvency advantages)… The evidence only speaks about nuclear power which does not talk about fusion energy specifically… please drop this from the round. --> This paragraph clears up that my opponent does not understand what I am trying to do with my plan. FISSION power has many harms but FUSION power has yet to be linked to anything. My opponent talks about nuclear waste that is proven to not be caused by fusion energy (in my solvency). Then he talks about water pollution caused by fission energy but fission and fusion are completely different types of energy. There are no links and there are therefore NO disadvantages. (www.aecl.com) --> Again the water pollution is not linked to fusion energy. The water pollution he talks about only deals with fission energy which has nothing to do with my energy plan. In the end… even if ALL of these harms are passed (which they do not link so they don't), fusion energy should STILL be invested in. It IS the energy of the future with little to no negative effects. Boiling water does not kill millions of people. The harm is not significant but the advantages are. The costs of fossil fuels ARE expensive and ARE running low AND are causing significant pollution to our earth. Therefore, the plan should be passed immediately. Thank you!"	PRO	158
S27d3ce0b-Ad033cdad	nuclear power is a reasonable approach to generating electricity	I present Rebuttals regarding to Pro`s arguments for Round 2. A) Pro says that ``coal-fired power plants as the single largest industrial contributers to this crisis, producing carbon dioxide, fine particulates, and cancerous heavy metals including mercury.``(http://www.ncpa.org...). However, in the developed country like the U.S. I understand that new, innovative technology is being tackeled for coping with the defects of coal power as a energy source. We must admit ``coal-fired power plants generate 52 percent of the electricity in the United States.``(http://www.ncpa.org...). And ``Modern coal-fired power plants produce 90 percent less of major air pollutants than previous generations, and because of their increased efficiency, they emit less carbon dioxide(CO2) into the atmosphere per kilowatt produced.``(http://www.ncpa.org...). We must pay attention to the economic benefits of coal. For example, according to the researchers at Pennsylvania State University, ``By 2015, the annual benefit of coal use at currently projected levels is estimated at more than 1 trillion dollars in gross domestic product(GDP), 360billion dollars in additional household income and nearly 7 million jobs.``(http://www.ncpa.org...). Furthermore, ``a 66percent reduction in coal-fired electric power generation would reduce GDP by 371 billion dollars, household income by 142billion dollars and employment by 2.7 million.``(http://www.ncpa.org...). Therefore, coal-fired electric power generations play an important role in American economy. We can say that coal-fired electric power is not inferior to nuclear power from the economic and social point of view. B) Pro argues wind and solar power. I present my opinion. Wind power needs stable amount of wind blow and solar power needs stable amount of sun shine. However, coal-fired power plant can generate electricity constantly and safely if the operation of plants are effectively controlled. Therefore, it is better than wind and solar power. Conclusion: Oil, coal and nuclear power are three major approach to generating electricity. Each of them has advantages and disadvantages. It is important that each country must choose the best energy from among them by taking the economic, social and financial situation into consideration. It is urgentry required that government and industry of the world should spend much money in developing a energy source constantly which is less harmful not only for the environment and the planet but for the human being for a long time. From above arguments I believe that nuclear power is not the best approach to generating electricity.	CON	159
See0f4916-Af052e87d	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"I thank the opposition for his reply, and will proceed to answer his arguments and further support my own. 1. His first argument is that the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 has already provided funding for alternative energy, and yet alternative energy projects have been halted because energy prices are no longer in the headlines. However, this is irrelevant because the Energy Improvement and Extension Act increased funding for traditional nuclear reactors. Without the shift to IFR technology, those traditional reactors will continue to generate waste which will be stored in Yucca Mountain. As stated in Round 1, we must shift to IFR's regardless of other alternative energy projects because failure to do so risks a nuclear volcano, destroying the biosphere. 2. His second argument is that funding for IFR's trades off with healthcare, defense, education, and welfare. I have several responses: a. First, some generic points: i. Spending is already out of control. According to the Colorado Daily News on June 30, 2010, the federal budget deficit is projected to hit $13.6 trillion next year. This means he is in a double bind: Either new spending crowds out education, and it should have already happened with our record deficits, or the deficits prove we can always borrow more money to pay for our programs. There is no reason why we can't spend money on healthcare, defense, education, welfare AND IFR's. Either way, the trade-off won't happen. ii. We only need $200-300 million dollars to develop the IFR. According to Tom Randall, Director of the McGovern Center for Environmental and Regulatory Affairs, IFR's can be developed within 2-3 years for $200-$300 million – with an ""m"" – dollars. This means that the cost of IFR's isn't sufficient to trigger his trade-off. iii. IFR's will bring in more tax revenue than they cost. According to the American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness, a new wave of nuclear construction would create billions of dollars in federal tax revenue and create hundreds of thousands of jobs through the entire life cycle of development. This means that we would have MORE money to fund education and the other programs he fears will be cut. iv. IFR's are more cost efficient than the forms of alternative energy the government is currently subsidizing. According to Dr. Charles Till, the price of IFR generated energy would be competitive with coal and natural gas, and cheaper than other forms of alternative energy. This means that by using IFR's, the government can end subsidies for the other more expensive AE technologies. b. Second, on healthcare: Funding for healthcare has just seen a massive increase. According to CBS News on March 23, 2010, the health care reform bill will create subsidies for individuals and families up to 400% of the federal poverty line. This money has already been appropriated, and will not be affected by my proposal. c. Third, on defense: Cuts to defense spending are inevitable. According to the Christian Science Monitor on June 28, 2010, the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the persistent deficits means that the defense budget will be slashed no matter what. Thus, if cutting the defense budget is as bad as he says it will be, the impacts are inevitable. There is no reason why spending $200 million on an IFR will destroy the $861 billion defense budget. d. Fourth, on education: i. Funding for education is increasing now. According to The Politico on February 2, 2010, President Obama's budget increases spending on education from $32.4 billion to $71.5 billion in 2011. This means that education is a budget priority, and is unlikely to be cut if we spend $200 million on an IFR. ii. Although some federal money is spent on education, most education funding is done at the state or local level. According to Minnesota Public Radio on January 28, 2010, one typical school district receives more than 80% of its funds from the state government. Thus, even if the federal government reduced its education spending, it would not create a major impact on education. e. Fifth, on welfare: Welfare spending is unsustainable in the status quo. According to the Heritage Institute, welfare spending is projected to cost $10.3 billion over the next ten years. This will cause the country to go bankrupt, harming everyone, including welfare recipients. Thus, some reduction in the amount of welfare spending is inevitable, and won't be caused by switching to IFR's. f. Sixth is impact analysis: i. Regardless of the cost in terms of trade-off, one thing is certain: status quo nuclear technology will continue unless something is done to change its course. This will result in many more thousands of tons of radioactive waste being stuffed into Yucca Mountain. ii. Even if the risk is low, there is a chance of a nuclear volcano. If this were to happen, it would be biosphericide – the end of all life on earth. As stated by Dr. David Camarow, ""there is no ‘low enough' when the consequences are so cataclysmic… as a people, as caretakers for future people, we cannot create unnecessary catastrophic risks like biosphereicide, the agonizing death of billions."" Thus, even if all of his impacts are true, we cannot risk the chance of not developing IFR's. iii. He says that we cannot support ""baseless"" claims about IFR's because of a recession. However, remember points 12 and 13 from Round 1. Nuclear power can generate billions of dollars of revenue and create thousands of jobs in the U.S. Thus, spending money to develop IFR's will help end the recession, or at the very least be an improvement on the status quo. 3. His third and final argument is that the free market solves better. I have several responses: a. First, there is no reason why the free market and government incentives are mutually exclusive. There is no free market in the world which is entirely free from some form of government influence. Considering there is government involving with nuclear power now, he articulates zero risk that one more government subsidy will create. According to Scott Sklar of the Mother Earth News on January 12, 2005, coal and oil subsidies top billions of dollars per year, making fossil fuels artificially cheap. Thus, free markets and federal funding for IFR's can co-exist. b. The free market cannot solve the energy crisis. According to Jeff Vail, reporter for the Energy Bulletin on March 5, 2007, the free market ignores solutions which do not generate an immediate or near term profit. Relying on the free market will never develop a mass scale non-carbon energy because it would violate a fundamental market principle. At the moment, fossil fuels are (comparatively) cheap, so there is no market incentive to develop any alternative energy. c. In the status quo, the market will continue to use status quo nuclear power. This will lead to the risk of a nuclear volcano. Regardless of whether the free market is good (or better than federal incentives), we MUST switch to IFR's to avoid a volcanic Yucca Mountain. Thus, any advantage to using the free market is outweighed by the risk that the free market won't switch to IFR's. d. Finally, I do not need to prove that using federal subsidies is the BEST method of reaching alternative energy, but rather that we SHOULD increase federal alternative energy incentives. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, ""should"" means ""must, or ought to (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency). Thus, I must show that it is our duty, or that it is proper or expedient to increase funding for IFR's. Based on the dangers of waste storage in Yucca Mountain, I have proven that funding IFR's is our duty, is proper, and is expedient. Regardless of whether or not it is the BEST method, it is better than the status quo, has no disadvantages, and we SHOULD do it."	PRO	160

Just this week, President Bush signed the Cafe Bill to become a law (which i'm against). This is going to require that by 2020 all cars must have 35 mpg's. Also that Honda FCX is now available in southern California. GM will also start selling Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell cars, which are powered by hydrogen. This car is strictly powered by water, no gas. Also, plug-in hybrids are coming. Toyota will have one available in the 2nd half of 08. Chevy has the highly anticipated Volt available in 2010 and Ford plus another China auto maker has plans to produce plug in hybrids. For hybrids, Chevy will have a Tahoe hybrid (SUV) that will have better fuel economy than a regular hybrid. Imagine that? There are tons of other cars, but I have to stop at some point. ""I like how you are in agreement with the alternative energy and you have a 2009 camaro as your picture.""- Bear I back the producing of alternative fuel cars, but I love Chevy, and can't wait for the Camaro to come out. The design is awesome, in my opinion, so what does this have to do with supporting alternate fuels? ""You have to realize we have E-85 available and we just are not making cars that can use it.""- Bears We aren't making enough E85 cars?!?! That is what you want to believe for this debate, but it is totally wrong. In chevy alone there are 7 E85 capable cars. At our dealership, every car we get that's available for E85 we order and we have no trouble getting it or having a car that is E85 capable. I can speak for GM, they are making plenty of E85 cars. ""But did you know that GM and Ford bought out the electric car because they knew it would sell but stopped selling it because they were losing money."" -Bear I can not speak for ford, but GM is selling the electric car in 2010. As I mentioned before it is the Volt. It runs on plug in electric for 40 miles, then your choice of E85 or biodiesel. They stop selling it, because they were LOSING MONEY! You will get no where when you are LOSING MONEY! So in conclusion, you have clearly haven't read Motor Trend yet and saw that there are already alternative fuel cars out there. Car companies can't just decide they will make a electric car one day, and be on the lot the next. It take 4-7 years for that. We are currently in the 2nd or 3rd year. Everything just takes time.

Sf074f877-A86857c20	Nuclear Power	"Thanks to Smooosh for this debate. I will now present my case. I. Intro Pro is implicitly using a cost-benefit analysis framework to analyze the arguments in this debate by appealing to the negative consequence he believes will arise from negating the resolution. That's fine--I can accept a cost-benefit analysis framework for this debate. This allows us to skip a lengthy framework debate and move straight into the issues. Given that many of the disadvantages to negating (e.g. terrorism) that Pro brings up would seem to be inherent to nuclear power at all times, Pro should argue for immediate or near immediate prohibition of nuclear power. Any phase-out mere prolongs the dangers Pro talks about, if you buy that his dangers are real. This is particularly relevant in terms of global warming (GW). If the point of reducing pollution is to end global warming, then action ought to be taken immediately (as I will show later on). And if uranium mining is as polluting as Pro claims, Pro ought to want it to end now, not later. Pro himself writes, ""nuclear energy is the WORST polluter of all energy sources. Most scientists believe, if we stop using fossil fuels today the effects on the environment would begin to reverse in as little as a decade."" Clearly, Pro should want us to stop using nuclear ""today"" if this is what he's arguing. Finally, it is important to note that it is not my task to show that nuclear energy will always be desirable in all circumstances. Merely, I must show that it ought not be prohibited. In this sense, Pro has a harder task ahead of him, because if nuclear power has neutral or beneficial outcomes, there is no good reason to prohibit it. Only if nuclear power is clearly harmful, would Pro be able to affirm under a cost-benefit paradigm. II. Global Warming A. GW Needs to be Tackled Soon We've all seen the reports about rising temperatures and sea levels. We've heard political pundits on the right deny that the problem exists and castigate the left for its alarmism. Yet, the data seems to confirm that the left's alarmism may be justified. If the earth's temperature rises between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, 20-30% of the world's animals and plants could vanish. [1] This would constitute a mass extinction. Increasing temperatures could cause sea levels to rise such that island nations like the Maldives or Marshall Islands, or coastal cities like Venice and Bangkok, could become entirely submerged; it could also cause crop yields to decrease, resulting in global food shortages. [2, 3] In order to stabilize temperatures before 2050, CO2 emissions will have to fall 60-80% by that time. [4] B. Nuclear Power cuts down on Greenhouse Gases (GHG) ""Cumulatively, nearly 60 GtCO2 have been avoided globally since 1971, thanks to nuclear power. Thus, if the present nuclear energy capacity were to be phased out and replaced by remaining technologies in the world's current energy mix...global annual CO2 emissions from electricity supply would rise by 12%."" [5] These OECD findings also show that, when factoring in direct and indirect emissions, nuclear power is cleaner than coal, natural gas, biomass, solar, and hydropower energy. The example of France is also a great case study in how nuclear power can significantly and positively impact the environmental picture. In fact, ""the speediest drop in greenhouse gas pollution on record occurred in France in the 1970s and '80s, when that country transitioned from burning fossil fuels to nuclear fission for electricity, lowering its greenhouse emissions by roughly 2 percent per year."" [6] C. Nuclear Plants vs. the Alternatives I've already established that nuclear power is cleaner, in terms of GHG emissions, than the alternatives, but it also has some other advantages related to its energy capacity. In the US, the average solar plant or wind farm operates at 15 or 25% capacity, respectively. In contrast, a ""nuclear plant can operate also at 90 percent of full capacity and can replace a coal-fired plant on a one-to-one basis."" It would take six solar plants or four wind plants to replace a single coal-fired plant. [7] Moreover, many alternative forms of energy suffer from inherent intermittency. The wind is not always blowing, the sun is not always shining, and the rivers are not always flowing (or at peak fullness). Nuclear power, however, can run at the same pace year round, and is not contingent on the weather to operate. The fact that nuclear power is clean, can produce more energy than alternatives, and is not subject to environmental conditions in the same way that the alternatives are, makes is a key tool in combating GW. It would make sense to scale up nuclear to quickly address the threat posed by GW, because of nuclear's advantages. Any phase out would likely prolong our reliance on coal, because of the inefficiencies of the non-nuclear, clean alternatives. III. Nuclear Power's Practical Advantages A. Nuclear Power is Cheap ""On average, in 2011, nuclear power had the lowest electricity production costs at 2.10 cents per kilowatt hour, and petroleum had the highest at 21.56 cents per kilowatt hour."" Nuclear power has a lower levelized cost than advanced coal with carbon capture, conventional combustion turbine, biomass, offshore wind, photovoltaic solar, and thermal solar. [14] B. Nuclear Power is Safe Nuclear power kills fewer people per terawatt hour than coal, oil, natural gas, biofuel, peat, rooftop solar, wind, and hydro, averaging just 0.04 deaths per terawatt hour. [15] Since the first nuclear power plant was constructed 63 years ago, there have only been three major nuclear meltdowns: Three Mile Island (TMI), Chernobyl, and Fukushima. Of those, only one--Chernobyl--produced any fatalities [16, 17, 18]. That's 1 accident every 21 years, but, in reality, the accidents are becoming rarer. TMI and Chernobyl were less than 10 years apart, but Fukushima was 25 years after Chernobyl [16, 17]. And, Chernobyl happened only because of a design flaw that, given its notoriety, will never again be repeated. IV. Miscellaneous Benefits of Nuclear Power A. Nuclear Power and Medicine Radioisotopes are key for conducting CT Scans and nearly half of all US cancer patients receive some kind of radiation-based treatment. More than 80% of drugs are tested using radioisotopes, and radioisotopes are used in medical research (e.g. finding a cure for AIDs). [8] Moreover, alternatives like cyclotrons (a kind of particle accelerator which can produce some kinds of radioisotopes) cannot replace nuclear power in serving the medical community. ""More than 80 per cent of the radioisotopes used in medical procedures worldwide come from research reactors. Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), which decays to form technetium-99m...the most commonly used radioisotope--is currently only produced in nuclear research reactors. A recent report (2010) from the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency indicates that non-reactor technologies for Mo-99 production are still decades away from fruition, and expresses strong doubts as to whether they could ever substitute for reactor technologies."" [9] B. Nuclear Power and Vehicles Nuclear-powered submarines are a key elements of some countries' defense forces, and prohibiting that technology could disadvantage any one of them in the face of the others, should those others not similarly prohibit that technology. Nuclear-powered icebrakers are important for keeping Arctic trade routes open, for rescues, and for research. They are more powerful than conventional icebrakers, giving them a wider range of use. [10] C. Nuclear Power and Space Exploration ""Unmanned spacecraft rely on radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for the power they need for space exploration. RTGs use heat from plutonium to generate electricity."" [11] RTGs of this kind could also be useful for rovers. Rovers, like the European Space Agency's Rosetta, often carry solar panels and batteries that they rely on for power. Rosetta landed in an area shaded by cliffs, meaning that it could only send out data for 64 hours before it shutdown. [12] A non-solar power source, like RTGs, could prevent wasted missions like that. They could also allow rovers even in areas not subject to constant shade to transmit continuously, not just when then sun was up. This technology is currently in the works: ""The Idaho National Laboratory's Centre for Space Nuclear Research in collaboration with NASA is developing an RTG-powered hopper vehicle for Mars exploration."" [12] Looking towards future missions into space beyond our solar system, nuclear power will be an essential tool. ""Nuclear energy proves to be the most effective when attempting to make long distance missions in space. Nuclear energy not only provides way more power than batteries, fuel cells, and photovoltaic, but it also is an enduring source of energy as it has a much longer lifespan. Unlike solar energy, nuclear power is not dependent on the intensity of the Sun's rays, which makes it the optimal choice for traveling into deep space."" [13] V.

S2f07394f-Abe7bcdcc	America should expand nuclear energy production.	"Closing Argument Americans are growing increasingly concerned about energy, and the growing problems with America""s energy supplies are further complicated by hostile and unfriendly nations which dominates the world oil supply. Coercive regimes, occasionally, employ energy supplies as an economic weapon to harm American interest. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to to augment the domestic energy supply while at the same time reduce the reliance on foreign oil. Nevertheless, the nuclear energy should not be considered one of those options. It is undeniable that nuclear power does offers some advantages over other power sources, but the technology entails a great risk, both financially and environmentally. Without a proper management, nuclear power would gravely threat national security. Often, due to the nature of the technology, government direct intervention is necessary. The subsidy is frequently at the expense of the taxpayers. Companies that are planning new nuclear units are expected to pay a sum between $6 billion and $9 billion for each 1,100 MW nuclear plant. MidAmercian Energy Holding, citing exorbitant cost as the main cause for canceling a proposed nuclear power plant, further reinforces the notion that nuclear energy is not the solution. No private sectors are willing to finance the new power plant, which necessarily leaves the government, therefore the taxpayers to subsidize the nuclear industry. The unsustainable cost alone could sufficiently invalid the policy of building more nuclear power plants. In addition to the prohibitive construction costs, safety issue is also one of the greatest concerns. Chernobyl, Three Island, and Fukushima Diichi plant accidents can happen anytime anyplace. Undoubtedly, the United States would build more advanced nuclear reactors than Japanese ones, the Fukushima tragedy, however, reminds the American people that a well-designed nuclear power plant may still fail catastrophically. Human errors, although greatly reduced, may still occur. In Chernobyl nuclear disaster, 190 tons of highly toxic radioactive materials were expelled into the atmosphere. Even today, millions of people are still hunted by this man-made nightmare. Given the complexity of world situations and increasingly alarming global warming, it is not unreasonable to assume that nuclear disasters may happen again, if not necessary in the United States. The United States is blessed with a cornucopia of energy resources. Developing them has been a pathway to prosperity for the nation in the past and offers similar promise for the future.[1] Therefore nuclear energy is not the sole option anymore. There are many alternatives that may serve the national interest while also meet the energy demands. Gulf of Mexico, both the Atlantic and Pacific Outer Continental Shelves, Western lands, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and off the Alaska coast. All these aforementioned places are within the boundary of the United States territory and they also contain an abundant conventional reserves beneath them.[1] The oil explorations entail a great risk to the surrounding environment, government should therefore develop a comprehensive energy policy to prevent the BP oil spill from happening again. In addition to explore and develop the oil reserves, partner with friendly neighbors would also ensure a steady steam of conventional energy supply. Canada and Mexico are home to enormous oil reserves and the United States should work in close partnership with them to develop those resources.[1] Natural gas is another option. Natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, and it should play a bigger role in the national energy supply.[1] Recent discoveries suggest that the United States may have an approximately 100-year supply.[1] Extracting this gas requires a technique called ""fracking."" Although the technique is not without risk, the potential benefits greatly overweight the potential environmental concerns. [1] Besides, it is much safety than nuclear technology. Solar and wind power are the future energy source. The existing technology to harvest solar and wind power is not mature, and the efficiency of power sources are constrained by uncontrollable factors. (Continued sunlight for solar power plants and geographic requirements for wind power plants.) But both powers are alternative to nuclear power. Instead of spending billions of dollars on subsidizing the nuclear industry, government should redistribute the appropriation to fund fundamental research and advanced technology. Jim Talent, former U.S. Senator from Missouri once said that ""America has hundreds of years of coal reserves. Recent discovers are making the United States the ""Saudi Arabia of natural gas."" [1] Even oil, according to the Senator, is available in much greater quantity. It is estimated that America has domestic reserves of at least twenty billion barrels of oil.[1] With such an abundant natural reserves, America should not risk its own national interest and security to pursue highly dangerous and widely deplored nuclear energy. Americans are growing increasingly concerned about energy. Much of the world""s supply of oil is delivered in a restrictive market dominated by unstable or hostile nations, some of which are using energy as a tool to frustrate U.S. National security and foreign policy objectives.[2][3] Sound national energy policy therefore is central to America""s freedom and prosperity. It is time to debunk the claim that nuclear power is inexpensive and safe energy source and lead government energy policy to move in the right direction.[2][3] Thank you.

Sefd746e-A6f670bfb	Nuclear Power VS. Solar Power	“However, a new technology which contributes to producing a solar power with less cost is being seriously studied and will be introduced into it in the future. At this time one of the benefits of a nuclear power plant over solar power will be faded away. In fact many companies have been challenging for developing a new technology for solar power for many years.” This argument is null because we agreed to limit this debate to technology that is commercially available as of January 2013. “Capacity and Safety : It is true that a nuclear plant can simply run at full load all night or during cloudy/ rainy days. However, in case of Japan, people must take a natural disaster into consideration. For example, it is predicted that a great earthquake might happen in Japan. Therefore, in that country a nuclear power is not a safety and dependable energy source. If the natural disaster or technical accident at nuclear power plant might take place, the soils around the plant would be contaminated with nuclear waste for many years. The important thing is that the the accident of a nuclear power plant brings about the devastation of the local economy and the life of people as we have experienced in the Fukushima reactors.” I already demonstrated in round 2, that American Nuclear reactors are built to much higher standards than Japanese nuclear reactors, The American Nuclear society even went so far as to say that a Fukushima-style disaster could not happen in the US (1). Also, Solar Power produces 10 times more deaths per Terawatt hour than nuclear power (2), so essentially Nuclear power is 10 times safer for everyone involved.

S845a5d8a-A8c486b84	tidal power	"to my oppeant who has forfiet it was wise becuase tidal power always wins and to more info on it The Rotors Apart from the substantial experience behind its development, SeaGen is more efficient both in the amount of energy it can extract from the current and in cost. This is because it uses a pair of pitch-controlled axial flow rotors, which for good reason are the technology of choice in the closely analogous low-head hydro and wind generator industries. In fact virtually 100% of all commercial sized wind turbines use pitch controlled open axial flow rotors. Many other, sometimes ""weird and wonderful"", rotor concepts have been tried both as wind turbines and as hydro-turbines but in the end the elegant simplicity and unsurpassed efficiency of the axial flow pitch-controlled rotor has been shown to make it superior in all respects to any other method of kinetic energy conversion. What applied in the fields of hydro and wind power seems unlikely to be significantly different in the field of water current kinetic energy conversion because similar laws of physics apply. The rotor design also provides the capability for controlling a large power system as the rotor blades may be pitched into a neutral position to stop the turbine gently even at full flow – an essential requirement for any power generation system; by comparison fixed pitch turbines require a powerful brake to stop them and if the brake fails they cannot be stopped. Moreover SeaGen's rotor blades can be pitched to limit the power to a pre-chosen ""rated power"" at times when high velocities are experienced; this greatly reduces the loads on the turbine structure, the rotor blades and the power take-off – and reduced and controlled loads translate into reduced costs and safer and more reliable operation. These days no major wind turbine manufacturers use fixed pitch rotors for the aforementioned reasons. What is more SeaGen's rotor blades can be pitched through 180 degrees so that the rotor can run efficiently in a bi-directional flow (on both the ebb and the flood tides) – this allows high lift/drag ratios to be developed (through using cambered high lift foils) which in turn are essential for high rotor efficiencies. MCT's patented rotor blade pitching system has been shown to permit rotor efficiencies of similar quality to the best in the wind turbine business. Fixed pitch rotors and rotors in ducts, as have been proposed by others, can never compete effectively for such high levels of efficiency or energy capture as can be gained from conventional pitch-regulated axial-flow rotors. This has been comprehensively demonstrated over several decades by the wind industry under closely analogous flow conditions. The Structure Apart from using the rotor technology of choice, MCT's SeaGen system is mounted on a structure securely seated on the seabed. This makes it easier to maintain and more steadfast in the challenging marine environment. The technology for placing monopiles at sea is well developed. The patented design of the SeaGen turbine is able to be installed and maintained entirely without the use of costly underwater operations. A unique, and also patented feature of MCT's technology is that the turbines and accompanying power units can be raised bodily up the support pile clear above sea-level to permit access for maintenance from small service vessels. This is an important feature because underwater intervention using divers or ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is virtually impossible in locations with such strong currents as are needed for effective power generation. The artist's impression indicates a row of turbines such as MCT is planning to install (subject to consents) off the north Anglesey coast and shows one raised for maintenance from a small workboat. Inexpensive access is particularly important for minimising the risks of running up unexpected maintenance costs. How do you fix the system so it cannot move? It is often not well understood that the act of taking energy out of a flowing water current generates a major thrust reaction, typically in the order of 100 tonnes per MW, which in turn demands competent foundations. Anchors, relying on gravity and friction with the seabed, and other such seemingly simple solutions are generally inadequate for commercially sized tidal turbines. Perhaps the most difficult engineering problems are the high structural loads to be dealt with and in effect solving the question of ""how do you nail it to the floor?"" The weakest material to which the turbine is attached is the seabed itself, even if it is rock, so the foundations need to be sized so as not to overstress the seabed and cause the turbine to move or break loose. This is where piles drilled deep into the bedrock of the seabed, as used by MCT are probably the only reliable solution. Comparisons with other technologies MCT's SeaGen is the only tidal current turbine world-wide to be ready for deployment in commercial projects. There are many web sites claiming to have developed such technology, but in reality there are very few other designs which have even been tested in the sea, and with one exception these are all small-scale demonstration projects that will need to be scaled up significantly before they could be capable of commercially viable operation. This is because the fixed overhead costs of an offshore project are high and therefore a large system is essential so as to collect enough energy to cover its costs and make a profit. Just as no wind farm developer these days will consider using windturbines of less than 1MW similarly it is uneconomic to consider using very small tidal turbines. These devices can also be compared in terms of the rotor swept area (or where a duct is used, the entry cross sectional area of the duct) since the swept area or entry area governs the cross-section of current energy that can be captured. Given devices of similar efficiency, the energy capture at any given site is proportional to swept area just as solar panels deliver in proportion to their array area and windturbines in proportion to their rotor area. MCT's economic analysis suggests that at least 300 square meters of rotor area are about the minimum that could realistically generate commercially competitive power; this is regardless of the kind of technology. For reference, MCT's SeaGen system with 16m rotors has a swept area of 402 square meters. Most of the few competitors who have demonstrated systems in the sea have devices with rotor diameters in the order of 5 to 9m, which would be 15 to about 60 square meters."	PRO	172
S3af9364a-A34579f2e	Nuclear Power is the most viable substitute from fossil fuels	I thank whoever accepts this debate. As the pro side, I define nuclear power as power generated as a result of nuclear fission and fossil fuels as coal, natural gas, and oil. The job of my opponent is to provide a suitable alternative that is more viable than nuclear in substituting fossil fuels. My first argument is nuclear power's ease of location. A nuclear plant can be built anywhere on land (and possibly sea) which could provide power for more desolate places or places which have temperature extremes. While the sun may be shining for the day, there are many places where solar panels are not cost effective. Geothermal energy is self explanatory as it can only be done where there is sufficient warmth in the ground. Wind energy has to be put in rather desolate places that have seasonal temperatures as the cost of maintaining wind farms in a blizzard is tremendous. Hydro has to be near water and cannot be inland without rivers. Nuclear plants can be built anywhere and the energy can be generated at a rather low cost which will later tie into my second point. Nuclear power can be in all temperatures and can be provided to every place in the world. Even coal, oil and natural gas have to be reasonably to a mine or well or the transportation cost would be too high. As shown in the following website, the cost of uranium needed for nuclear does not really affect the price. Logically following, the location of the uranium that it uses does not have to close to the plant. http://www.world-nuclear.org... (chart is about 1/3 of the way down) I look forward to anyone accepting this debate and presenting an alternative that can replace fossil fuels and is more viable than nuclear, which I currently believe is easily the most viable.

S1baa36a6-A2b787729	Can alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuels.	"Electric cars can be expensive to own (the price of the batteries). They won""t go far without stopping to re-charge the battery. Except in London, there is almost nowhere you can go to charge them up. Most of the electricity in this country is made by burning coal, gas or oil, so this means that electric cars end up being as pollutants as the fossil burning cars. The batteries used to power electric cars are very heavy. This slows the cars. Battery costs will vary but may be several thousand pounds and they have to be replaced every 5 years. The batteries use lithium and other rare metals. Disposing of batteries causes real environment problems. In an accident it may be difficult to get you out of the car because of the dangers of electrocution. Chemicals spilled from the battery may also be dangerous. The average electric car available in the UK will reach 50-55 mph. this is lower than even a small 1.1L car. A kilogramme of petrol contains enough energy to propel a car about 15 miles. A kilo of fully-charged lithium-ion battery will drive your electric car 500 yards. And you only get about 100 miles to a fully-charged battery at best, compared with 1,000-plus miles from the most economical diesels. This leads to ""range anxiety"", or the fear you will be stranded miles away from a socket. The energy intensive manufacturing of EVs means that some cars make almost double the impact on global warming as conventional cars. This is mostly because of the raw materials and energy needed to build the lithium-ion batteries. In the UK, during 2012, electricity generation from coal-fired power stations actually increased to almost 40% of total production, as the price of gas soared, and gas-fired electricity generation was reduced. Electricity from coal, which is the most polluting way to generate power, drastically reduces the environmental advantage for EVs. Because China, for example, generates almost all its power from coal, life cycle analysis of EV cars in China shows they are far more polluting than conventional cars. This means that depending on the electricity produced based on coal, the impact of an electric car can vary. If the production of burning coal based electricity is really high, it means that the impact of an electric car can be even higher than a fuel powered car."	CON	174
S4b391e77-Adc683495	The US should encourage more nuclear energy use over current widely used energy forms.	"I'd like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate and for responding in a serious manner, with effort shown, in contrast to some others. First off, let's look at the energy we use in the United States now, as I stated before coal burning makes up about 50% of our energy production. According to the same source (that's [1] in the above round) 15% is generated through natural gas, and 3% comes from petroleum. These basically have the same problems as coal, minus the mining issues. They contain harmful chemicals and they emit toxins when burned (again, [1] from above round). Now that makes up for 69% of our energy, but where does the rest comes from? Well, nuclear makes up about 20% of our energy [10], leaving about 11% or so for renewable sources. My opponent brings up wind, solar, hydrogen, and tidal energies. Now, I know a little about wind, solar, and hydrogen. But I am not that aware of tidal energy beyond the bare basics. I would love it if my opponent would provide backing that tidal energy is actually being used in America to generate energy, and how much energy it generates, percentage wise. As it isn't even listed on the Energy Information Administration's site, I would assume that it isn't a significant part of our energy make-up Now, let's look a little at wind energy, solar energy, and hydrogen energy. These types of energy, while they may be non-polluting, are simply not economical. When choosing the energy make-up of our country, it is important to choose a main form of energy that can provide what is known as a base load power. A form of energy that can actually be economical, so that companies will choose it, and can take a big portion of our energy. Nuclear is the only base load power that is clean. There is simply no other choice [11] available at the present time or in the foreseeable future. Now that we have seen that our present choice is basically between fossil fuels and nuclear power, let's look at why nuclear power is the superior choice: Response to Contention 1: The piece quoted excludes coal, precisely because the organization knows that coal does leave behind waste. As I have already shown, we only have two large-scale choices of energy at the present time. Coal, as I have already shown in the above round, produces 100 times the radiation of nuclear energy. So we see the harm from coal is greater than the harm from nuclear. Now, I'd like to just talk about nuclear radiation. How much is produced? What effects has it had? Well, nuclear waste produced by a plant is less than a golf ball, per person, per year. About 40,000 tonnes (~44,092.5 tons) of waste come from nuclear plants from all across the WORLD every year. The whole world produces about 44,000 tons of nuclear waste. Compare that to the billions of tons of more radioactive waste from coal plants, and the choice is clear. Nuclear is the way to go. But, let's look less at the theory and more at the record. What has happened. Well, there has never been a single death or health incident in the United States from nuclear power in our almost sixty years of using it [13]. This includes its use on ships in the Navy, where men and women live and work on basically, floating nuclear reactors, for months or years of their lives. Again, compare this to coal. Under normal operation, coal and other fossil fuels kill 25,000 people EVERY YEAR [14]! The choice for the good of the citizens of the United States is clear. Response to Contention 2: There is simply no link between nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear power, anymore than there is a link between coal power and BBQ-caused house fires. The United States uses fuel from nuclear warheads. They are actually TAKING APART some of our weapons to use as fuel for nuclear reactors [15]. Using more nuclear power will, if anything, decrease weapons proliferation in the United States. In fact, it is far easier to make a nuclear weapon with plain uranium than with uranium fuel from a reactor [16]. No one is going to steal uranium fuel so they can have a tougher time making bombs. Now, up to this point, I've been summarizing the articles I cite, in my own words, however this article says it better than, I believe anyone really could. ""The fissionable isotope of uranium must be enriched to 90% to create a weapon. In a reactor it is only 3%. You could not blow up a nuclear reactor if you tried."" [17] It is simply impossible to take uranium from a reactor and turn it into a weapon. Response to Conclusion: This argument actually includes nuclear energy, as it is a form of alternative energy. The study cited included nuclear, as that is an alternative. Source Comparison: My opponents has used three sources, an admission from the IAEA (this argument doesn't actually stand anymore), the AES (this that my opponent actually mis-interpreted) and a Illinoisan anti-nuclear organization. I have used sixteen to this point, including the Energy Information Administration, the Washington Post, the National center for Policy Analysis, the Wall Street Journal, doctors, scientists, nuclear technicians, even a senator. It is obvious my sources are superior in enforcing the Resolution in the round you are viewing. Apology: I would like to apologize to those who have to read this response as it is rather lengthy. I am very pro-nuclear and have a lot of information availably to me on the topic, that I could pack into here with almost no limit, so it rambles on a little. Thank you to those that persevered to the end of my response and to my opponent, who must slave through this lengthy read. Conclusion: Nuclear energy simply is our only option other than fossil fuels on a large-scale, and we can see its superiority to fossil fuels. Consider it this way. There is a door, this door leads to energy. There are three paths. The first, renewable energy stops in a dead end short of the door. The second, fossil fuel power kills some of the people that pass through it and injures others. The third is nuclear power. It has never killed anyone and it goes all the way to the door. It doesn't have the downsides of other forms of energy. It is simply, the logical choice, the best choice, the choice for a cleaner, healthier, and wealthier America. Thank you!

S66699e25-A5871b7c8	Nuclear power presents the only viable option for reducing CO2 output	I believe that solar energy and wind are in fact viable options of reducing co2 output. Solar and Wind do not pose grand ecological and human threats like nuclear power plants. Nuclear waste has to be specifically and carefully stored. pro has mentioned overall lifetime cost of nuclear energy is cheaper per kilowatt, but pro forgets to remember that nuclear fuel will only last 200 more years at current energy consumption(which is increasing) and that governments have to invest extensively into things such as nuclear waste storage places like the WIPP that cost's the federal government $19 billion. Nuclear power only powers 11% of the worlds electricity, increasing that power level to 100% will cause a 9X increase in nuclear fuel demand, which will deplete these supplies within 1-2 decades. Using basic math and estimations, we find that nuclear fission is a short term solution to a long term problem. Solar and wind have been around since almost the dawn of the Earth. Why not invest in these new technologies that continue to become more efficient, easier to implement, and better for the planet. Nuclear power plants might i add can cause severe ecological damage due to its ability for radiation. The fukushima disaster costed Japan around $140 billion dollars to decontaminate, evacuate, and so many other problems. These nuclear disasters have occurred very oftenly throughout history. A tsunami triggered this disaster and in order for nuclear to be more viable, we have to place these power plants farther from the coastline where electricity demand is highest to avoid these costs. Also, 5% of electicity produced is lost through long transmission wires and conversions which will reduce the cost-competetiveness of nuclear power plants. Solar and wind farms are renewable unlike nuclear energy. solar and wind will not deplete for another billion years or so whereas nuclear energy will probably deplete within 1-2 decades if nuclears is used as the prime source of electricity. If you look at the levelized cost of electricity here http://www.eia.gov... you will find that the lcoe of wind it is 80.3 per mwh while advanced nuclear energy is at 96.1 per mwh. Hmmmm, which is cheaper? Look, wind and solar will solve, new tech is advancing to make them more efficient. Nuclear fission supplies will only last a couple of years if you implement them to their absolute capacity while wind will always blow as long as there is the sun to stir the air. Solar will always be here until the sun burns out. You can't solve long term global warming with short term nuclear energy, It is illogical. Even if the cost of creating wind turbines and solar energy may be bad for the environment now, the investement will eventually pay off as these are long term solutions that are renewable and don't require a fuel supply that will eventually run out. Once all the nuclear fuel is spent, what do we do? Burn more fossil fuels? No, eventually when all the nuclear fuel is gone, they will have to develop solar, wind, and other sources of renewable energy in order to attain long lasting energy supplies. http://www.world-nuclear.org... http://www.scientificamerican.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.eia.gov...

This rubbish is then sent straight out into the environment courtesy of the humans who made it. In Australia, where I live, most of the country is run by coal plants. Why? Because some 'green' people do not want to see a start to a new era of cleaner energy. Instead, they advocate the immense destruction of our atmosphere with the dozens of coal plants that spit out all these toxins constantly. This waste they give out is far worse than nuclear radioactive waste. Nuclear waste will eventually decay until it is no longer harmful. Fossil fuel waste doesn't decay. It just hangs around until it destroys something. Now, compare what we do with these waste: Nuclear: Deposit it in sealed containers in deep repositories that will have no contact with any part of the eco system. Fossil fuel: Dump the sludge waste in landfill sites and send the CO2 into the atmosphere. This is rather appalling. We pay so much attention to what we think is dangerous that we miss the actual danger that is slapping us in the face. Furthermore, Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product.[2] Everyone else just doesn't seem to care. Secondly, Nuclear power is so sustainable, it has the ability to last us until we definitely need it no longer. With modern-day technology, we can potential use nuclear energy for 30,000 years. We will only need nuclear for a few hundred, but the implications are enormous. Instead of digging up the last of the coal we have and burning it, we can extract a little bit of Uranium from the earth and use that to power us until we have the ability to reach nuclear fusion or any other completely clean energy source. Compared to coal plants, where we have to burn 250,000 tonnes of coal PER DAY. I'd say we have a pretty good chance if we chose to go down the nuclear instead. We definitely won't survive much longer on coal. Thirdly, Nuclear power is far more economical in the long run versus coal and oil plants. For a start, it is the cheapest form of power available. The National Academy of Sciences in a 2009 report said that the cost of nuclear power is equal to or lower than natural gas, wind, solar, or coal with carbon capture. Reactors can operate for 80 years, while wind and solar last about 25 years. And nuclear reactors operate 90 percent of the time, while wind and solar are only available about a third of the time. [3] (Remember: wind and solar power can't be stored today in significant amounts.) Most people don't want their lights and computers working only when the wind blows. Fourthly, Nuclear power plants are a couple thousand times more efficient than conventional coal plants. Nuclear power turns 98% of the fuel into heat, [4] which is used in the electrical generating process. Of the remaining 2%, 40% of it is treated and turned back into usable fuel. The remaining 1% is the waste. In a coal plant, 65-75% of the fuel is turned into heat and the rest is waste product. That is an astounding difference that should make you cry. If that doesn't, then this will: for every 15 tonnes of waste produced in a nuclear plant, a coal plant will spit out 500 million tonnes. That is a giant win for nuclear power in terms of efficiency. So how can one say that it is an unreasonable approach? Have a look at these quick facts about nuclear energy: http://www.nei.org... Fithly, Nuclear power plants are on average, safer to humans than coal and oil. Since I live in Australia, I don't have to worry too much about dangerous air pollutants, though they are an increasing problem, but in 2000, the Ontario Medical Association declared air pollution ""a public health crisis"" [4] and coal-fired power plants as the single largest industrial contributors to this crisis, producing carbon dioxide, fine particulates, and cancerous heavy metals including mercury. In 2005, the Ontario Medical Association estimated that air pollution costs the province more than six hundred million dollars per year in health care costs, as well as causing the premature deaths of thousands of Ontarians each year [5].[6] Australia is soon to be Ontario if coal burning keeps up like this. Many places in the world are already worse than Ontario. China for instance, has air pollution in some cities that can be seen from upper orbit. Air pollution is indeed a grave problem on a global scale. Across the world 850,000 people are known to die prematurely because of it.[7]. Lastly, Nuclear power plants help the development of more cleaner and efficient uses of nuclear energy namely, nuclear fusion. In a talk on energy and climate entitled, ""Innovating to Zero"", Microsoft's Bill Gates gives a compelling argument for why we need nuclear power in an age of increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 [8]. Using a simple equation, he argues that CO2 is a product of the number of people on the planet, the services delivered per person, the energy needed per service, and the amount of CO2 produced by each unit of energy. The first two are heading up and are unlikely to be stopped. The cost of energy is decreasing, but not enough. So that leaves the fourth factor. We must use energy that does not produce greenhouse gases, but we need reliable energy – energy that's available when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Gates believes that nuclear power offers this promise and should be part of the mix, especially if improved (safer) technology is employed. Energy conservation should be a viable way to transition from dirty to clean energy, but increases in services delivered per person along with a growing population would quickly eat up conservation savings. So think of nuclear power like a bridge. its not what we want forever, but we cant stay with what we have for long, and we cant get what we need for the future now, so while we wait, we use the best alternative we can muster. Since that is the purpose of nuclear power, we can definitely call it a reasonable approach to generating electricity for the time being. [1]http://www.ucsusa.org...

S53275be8-A2a8a5c2e	Energy demands are increasing exponentially and nuclear power is the only renewable source capable of matching it	"Although EU countries are using energy more efficiently, demand for energy continues to rise, especially in the new eastern European member states. The demand for electricity is expected to rise by 8-9% by 2020 meaning a much more urgent need for generating capacity[1]. At the same time world energy consumption is projected to expand by 50% from 2005 to 2030 leading to high oil and gas prices[2]. The production of renewable energy is not growing at a fast enough pace to replace fossil fuels; wind, wave and solar simply cannot provide the quantities of energy required. It is possible – indeed, desirable - to combine nuclear power with other renewables, but nuclear energy is a crucial part of that mix as the only option capable of producing the quantity of energy required. Nuclear power is actually more efficient than any other power source: a gram of uranium 235 contains as much energy as four tons of coal[3].

Sf4c49f83-A498fe8c5	Nuclear power is beneficial for society	It is in my strong belief that nuclear power is beneficial to society. I will present to you four points are why nuclear power is good for society. First, nuclear power has basically no carbon dioxide emissions that are released into the atmosphere. Global warming has been proven to be a huge problem and the world is struggling to come up with a clearn alternativie energy. Solar and wind just don't have that kind of capacity to produce enough energy for a nation to use. Nuclear does. Take France for example more than 78% of its total energy is produced by nuclear and the country's carbon dioxide levels have lowered over the last 30 years, something very few countries can say. Nuclear is just one very clean source of energy. Radiation levels near nuclear power plants are about as much as someone sitting in their house for a year contrary to popular belief. I will now proceed to allow my opponent to attempt to point out flaws in nuclear energy.	PRO	182
See0f4916-A835169d5	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"I hate long speeches and like to keep my arguments concise. But since my opponent enjoys long speeches and bullet points, I shall entertain him here. Be warned: this post will be long and boring... 1. b. For every person blaming the market for the economic collapse, there is another blaming the government for initiating the problem. From a judge's point of view, of course it is better to be considered ""negligent"" than being recognized as the problem. Reviewing the history of the financial crisis, it is clear that Congressional intervention played a large part in the rise and fall of the subprime mortgage system (http://en.wikipedia.org...) ""1938: The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, is established (as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal) to purchase and securitize mortgages to ensure that funds are consistently available to the institutions that lend money to home buyers. 1968: Fannie Mae is converted from a federal government entity to a stand-alone government sponsored enterprise (GSE) which purchases and securitizes mortgages to facilitate liquidity in the primary mortgage market. The move takes the debt of Fannie Mae off of the books of the government. 1970: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) is created by an act of Congress, as a government sponsored enterprise, to buy mortgages on the secondary market, pool them, and sell them as mortgage-backed securities to investors on the open market; 1971 it issues its first Mortgage Participation Certificate security."" Still want to say that the government incentives have nothing to do with starting the crisis itself? 1. c. According to an interview with DOE Secretary Dr Steven Chu (http://www.technologyreview.com...), IFR is only an option to deal with future waste. It will not eliminate existing waste at Yucca Mountain. If we don't need nuclear power as a fuel, IFR will not consume existing waste and ""avoid"" what's already been done. There are already many reprocessing technologies in developments besides IFR. Many potential energy sources are also in development (http://en.wikipedia.org...). 2. a. My opponent has taken a very narrow interpretation of the resolution. Basically, he's saying that provision of basis for increase incentiv to any ONE alternative energy incentive shall win his this debate. I contend that he shall make a strong case against all other projects that also deserve increase in incentives. Maybe incentives in education for better technology of the future? Incentives for using more efficient appliances? We cannot increase EVERYTHING. Even if we manage to cut spending from somewhere else, it does not automatically justify transferring the money to alternative energy initiatives. Until my opponent can provide a sounding argument to why alternative energy incentives should be agreed as the best solution or the most important issue around, the reader cannot reasonably conclude that alternative energy incentives should not be DECREASE to support other more important and effective projects. 2. b. My point is that, regardless whether IFR is good, IFR should not be developed by the government especially if the intent is to MAKE MONEY. How is it not a nationalized entreprise if the government gives exclusive rights to someone to develop a profitable technology? The Fed made huge money buying distressed assets in the financial crisis but remained in deep red with its investment in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG. Still trying to show that government actually know how to make money? 2. c. the federal government has many priorities and legal obligations, but it is all about prioritizing. The polls you cited only indicate people's general view that funding toward national defense and healthcare reform can better spent. They do not prioritize the importance of energy reform over those in defense or healthcare. I completely agree that there are market interferences now and that's exactly why it SUCKS. Go over ECON 101 and you can find all the reasons why interference has been and will be bad. They NEVER WORK. 3. a. It is completely ridiculous to solely blame free market for environment destruction. Government invented nuclear bomb. Government invented internet leading to both benefits and harms (kiddy porn, cyber bullying?). Every invention has its pros and goes. Demonization of free market is narrow-minded and completely ridiculous. The private sector has invested plenty of resources toward environmental solutions and it's simply ignorant to disregard them. Just because my opponent has no business sense to create a valid proposal for his enviromental concern does not mean he should be allowed to force his ill-planned strategy onto the rest of . 3. b. First of all, building of any factory, private or public, will lea to population of the air and water, and depletion of natural resources. Engineering and technological developmett ALWAYS presents trade-off with ecological soundness. The very reason why pollution is widespread in China is due to implicit political backings among these local commodities-based companies who receives special treatment from the local government. Corruption and briberies are abundant across China. Arguably, a private company like BP is more ecologically responsible since it does not receive government protection for its wrongdoing. 3. c. All report has only indicate that ""we don't like our current defense policy; we don't like our healthcare reform; we think energy is important."" I agree completely! I'm not going to NOT support something that inherently sounds like a beneficial goal. (no duh?) However, the main debate is the balance of priorities and my opponent still refuse to produce reason or evidence why energy concerns shall be valued above all else and receive priority treatment. 3. d. If you believe that oil and coal prices are artificially low due to government incentives, take them away! (another example of failed government incentive). That will present an immediate need for energy alternative, no? By limiting its influence in incentives and maximum nuclear waste allowance, the energy companies will seek their own solutions (IFR or otherwise) to compete in the free market. Many electrical cars are now in production and oil companies are expanding their alternative energy profile. I pity my opponent's complete ignorance and disregard of private effort to innovate for the future. If any private company is intentionally ignoring the energy need of the future, it is only due to governent incentives hindering the evolutionary elimination of out-dated technology. Since the next round will be my opponent's last round, please provide a simple explanation to why this energy concern should be valued above all other important social needs that demand ""substantial increase in incentives?"""

Sf1a21db5-A93630324	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"I will go from paragraph to paragraph... INHERENCY The true inherent barrier is stated in the plan. This plan will only accomplish what it is supposed to when passed because of the money from Congress (that was cut off) is going to be paid. Since that money was overturned, the inherent barrier was created. Thus, the only way these incentives will be substantially increased is if the plan is passed. SOLVENCY The point in the round is to only to substantially increase alternative energy INCENTIVES. Therefore, the plan creates an organization specific to creating fusion AND therefore incentives are increased. When the group is made to create fusion (which increases incentives), then they will not be able to spend the money on other stuff so the incentives ARE increased. AGAIN, I do not have to show that fusion power WILL be obtained or how long, but simply that the incentives will be increased and that when they are increased, the energy will come soon. The big problem with fusion energy is that people don't know a whole lot about it. But when we get the power of the sun, anything will be possible. My opponent puts the burden of me to prove that environmental harms won't happen. But it is my job to show the advantages of the plan and it is my opponents job to show the disadvantages. My opponent offers no evidence that these harms will happen and I have seen nothing of this. The point of policy debate is to have AFF provide the advantages and NEG to provide disadvantages and compare them... THEN have the judge to decide if they should pass the plan. BESIDES ALL OF THAT, I would like to cross-apply my Advantage 5 from my case that states the few environmental harms. Even if there are some, it will not outweigh the numerous waste products there are now from current energy forms. the environment harms come from the factory (if there are any, but NEG still has to provide evidence that there is ANY), but then the harms would STOP right there. Let's just say that before this plan was passed that it would be 100 years before fusion energy could be achieved. WITH increasing energy incentives, THEN it can be made possible to get the energy in 20 years. In other words, increasing the energy INCENTIVES does not mean that this energy will be ready for use tomorrow, but rather that we will have the POWER OF THE SUN in a shorter time. SIGNIFICANCE & HARMS 1) There is NO link to water pollution 2) There is NO quote from the evidence that has ANYTHING to do with water pollution from fusion energy and if there was it has not been quoted in the round yet. 3) NEG MUST prove (with evidence) the link between fusion energy and water pollution AND must prove that it is significantly worse than current water pollution for energy. (numbers on the bottom) 1)-->It is NEG's job to provide evidence of environmental harms. 2)-->It is NEG's job... again... to provide harms and disadvantages. 3)-->The agenda will be created by the legislative intent claimed in case. It will consist of making fusion energy WHICH increases energy INCENTIVES. 4)-->Must only increase energy INCENTIVES. With that increase comes the chance of getting the energy significantly sooner. The sooner we can get the power of the sun the better. In the end, my opponent has offered NO disadvantages with any proof WHATSOEVER. If this was allowed, he could say that ""he has not proven that fusion energy won't provide EVERY harm known to man."" It is NOT my job to show that fusion energy does not have every harm known to man... Rather, it is NEG's job to show the disadvantages (with evidence) and then have us compare that to the advantages (in case) to decide if the plan should be passed. Therefore, I urge a PRO vote...

Sf074f877-Ace086ca5	Nuclear Power	"Thank You Mr President for an insightful look into the ""bennefits"" of nuclear power. Now onto my rebuttal! Nuclear power is safe? I would have to consider the claim by my opponent that nuclear power is safe, to be a little more than a stretch, it's outright false. There are several factors my opponent failed to consider. First let's consider the health effects on the uranium minners! https://www.scientificamerican.com.... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.... https://www.epa.gov... Since most uranium minning is not done in western countries, most westerners are unaware of the effects that plague uranium minners, and that extends to the enrichment process as well. My opponent seems to downplay the effects of major meltdowns. When radioactive material is released on as large of a scale as it was at chernobyl, the radiation becomes omnipresent. It doesn't act like a liquid or a chemical which are influenced by matter, instead it radiates through the air, the vegetation on the ground, and the ground itself, including groundwater, insects and animals. It moves through solid earth as if the earth isn't even there. It contaminates the earth, the insects, the animals, the vegetation and groundwater in the effected area for hundreds of years. Only 25 to 40 deaths can be inextricably linked to the Chernobyl meltdown, but the World Health Organization says that number is probably far higher, but since radiation sickness effects each person differently, it would be impossible to directly link each death to that specific incident. Furthermore, the WHO (the organization, not the band) has noted a rise in cancer and infant mortality rates in the effected areas of the Chernobyl meltdown. https://www.usnews.com.... http://www.world-nuclear.org.... More than three quarters of the nuclear power plants in the US have reported some kind of radiation leak. My opponent also brings up the fact that sea levels are rising which should also be of concern for all of us because nuclear power plants need large amounts of water, so they are built near water. It may not take a mega earthquake to cause the next nuclear accident. Because of global warming, powerful storms happen more often, these storms may be a risk to the ""safety"" of nuclear power. In March of 2014, a Malaysian flight with more than 200 people went missing. Officials believe the pilot purpously took the plane off course and flew it into the ocean, it has never been seen or heard of since. Could a nuclear technician with suicidal feelings be capable of sabotaging a reactor and cause unspeakable damage to lives? This scenario is conjecture I know, but in my mind, the only way to know with 100% certainty that it can't happen would be to prohibit nuclear energy. http://gizmodo.com.... There's also the storing of radioactive waste, which has to be stored, cooled, and monitored for 100,000 years. The facilities that store the waste has to be maintained and checked for leaks, and guarded because of the hazards it can pose to humans, and its appeal to terrorists. This does not sound safe to me. None of these problems would arise from renewable energy. If the glove don't fit, we must prohibit! Nuclear is NOT clean. My opponent points out that solar and wind farms need backup generators far more often then nuclear, he also points out that nuclear plants produce far more energy. I don't dispute those claims, but when you put them into context, you realize that nuclear would need to rely on backup generators just as much, if not more. Nuclear plants produce more energy than solar or wind, but when a nuclear plant is down, it would need more, or larger generators to compensate for a higher energy demand. Furthermore, as I pointed out in my opening statement, energy saving batteries are becoming cheaper and more efficient, which eliminates the need for backup generators. I also pointed out that nuclear has to rely on GHG burning equipment for minning and processing, and trucks and trains for shipping. The process of creating nuclear energy is NOT free of GHG emissions. http://www.sciencedirect.com... Thermal pollution is also an environmental concern posed by nuclear power. Cost!!! When you take into consideration the cost of building an energy producing facility, and the cost of gathering and processing the fuel needed for the energy source, it gives you a wider spectrum of the true cost of your energy. This type of calculation is called ""levelized cost"".http://energyinnovation.org.... When you take all these points of analysis into consideration, nuclear doesn't do as well when compared to many different types of renewables. I must also point out that this analysis doesn't take into consideration any possible environmental impact posed by each power source, so renewables would fair even better vs traditional power sources. My opponent seems to be prodding me to argue for prohibiting nuclear power immediately, however I see no need for this resolution. I think as renewables become more of a mainstream option, countries will recognize that traditional power sources are obsolete and will no longer renew the contracts needed for continuing production. Furthermore there is nothing in the proposal by my opponent that suggests I have to adhere to an ""immediate end to nuclear"" argument. Testify, bsh1."	PRO	185
S78068d61-Ad2e9d398	Nuclear power should be banned	"To voters, don't think that just because con cited a million lobby groups he has any credibility. He has misquoted and twisted sources, as I have shown, quoted personal opinions of lobby group members as facts, and ignored almost all of my sources. But on to what actually matters in the debate - the arguments: Waste First, on solar energy. I've already said solar panels can be safely recycled. My opponent's source is an article detailing how solar companies are setting up recycling programmes. Con also drops pretty much all of my counter-arguments from last round, such as how their quantity is much smaller than nuclear and how we aren't ""throwing out"" anything, only REMOVING these dangerous chemicals from the environment and putting them into solar cells. Second, on wind energy. Hey look, it's a new argument in round four! My opponent claims wind is a waste of money. Well, that's much better from a moral perspective than a waste of human lives, which is what nuclear does! My opponent's main source that wind is a waste of money is a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing an extremist opinion (and the author is the executive director of an organisation sponsored by nuclear lobbyists called ""Great Lakes Wind Truth""). I've already provided evidence that wind is not any more costly than nuclear, and in fact the US government says it's cheaper. The wind lobbyists claim their turbines cost only five cents per kwh (cheaper than coal by a mile!) [1], and I think they'd know better than the nuclear lobbyists. 500 homes is quite a bit considering that most wind farms have hundreds, if not thousands of turbines. Third, my opponent notes radiation occurs with geothermal energy. Wow, more new arguments. That's because geothermal requires an energy input - usually it requires about 1kw for a geothermal plant to generate 5kw. In the USA (con's source is from the US government), this initial current is usually generated with a nuclear reactor. I say - why not do what NZ does, and use hydroelectric or wind to generate that initial 1kw? No radiation is generated as part of the geothermal generation process, and NO byproducts are generated unless it's broken (waste fluid is re-injected back into the Earth). Fourth, hydroelectric. As with wind energy, don't believe con's assertions that it's more expensive. It isn't. Fish population displacement is a problem, so any potential site would need to be evaluated for this purpose to check that fish can still breed etc. Many newer hydroelectric dams have elaborate systems to allow fish to be elevated up and down the dam, circumventing this problem. Next my opponent sources three more lobby-group assertions (seriously, stop quoting World Nuclear!) to boost his sources count. All three assertions I have already countered. It's not just that waste is the main issue. It's the danger that the waste poses to human lives. Con has never specifically addressed this fact. No other industry has so much waste - indeed, no green energy has ANY toxic byproducts from electricity generation. I never said I wanted to ban coal, I said I'm against coal power plants, so my opponent's coal assertions are irrelevant. I didn't drop any of the argument concerning safe waste disposal because it didn't exist. My opponent made no case in round three that it was safe except for a breif assertion that I answered with reference to a scientific study that I had already cited. Regulations do not make waste safe. No regulation can stop a major environmental disaster breaking them open, or the radiation that we KNOW is leaking out. More importantly, no regulation IS doing it. Also I did talk about Lead at the same time as I talked about Mercury - ever used a lead-acid battery, con? And about the economists who don't like solar cells, the Chinese point out that to make the solar panels they use American equipment, and sell them to America so that America can make money off them. It's really a win-win for both countries. Also my opponent confused exports and imports last round. I guess some economists really are stupid... [2] Weapons My weapons analogy was not to show that a nuclear power plant behaves like a nuclear weapon. My point was to show that they are the same except one is operating in a controlled fashion. That's not conceeding the debate, or even the argument. Con has never even addressed the point. I'm not referring to a dirty bomb or any explosive device at all. I'm just saying that the same dangerous effects felt by places around a nuclear bomb in ten seconds are felt in places around a nuclear power plant in 1000 years or so. Jobs I said in round one that I would not instantly fire all nuclear workers. There are many jobs in decommissioning plants (usually even more than are required for their running), plus there would be jobs in all the other things that would need decommissioning. That would give time for capital investment to flow into the clean energy sector and create the jobs. Nuclear power has created more jobs because they've had more investment - and despite this, wind and solar have had far more new capacity additions [3]. I've already proven that solar is better in terms of job creation (see last round). It's not just that I'm scared. It's that there are tangible harms to me being right, and tangible benefits to following my model even if I'm wrong. More jobs is a tangible benefit of following my model. Cost Again, my opponent shows his ineptitude at reading sources. It doesn't say 67 cents, it says 67 dollars. And it included nuclear power plant tax breaks and subsidies. The study I cited did not include any government market manipulation and was therefore a much better way to evaluate relative costs. It also used a much larger number of data points, using the whole of the USA instead of just California. Safety I've already provided a source proving that there is NO HARMLESS LEVEL OF RADIATION. Every tiny bit of radiation has some impact. X-rays last a few seconds at most - these people had to live with all that radiation for years! And his only source saying the contrary comes from World Nuclear's spin doctors, not the medical doctors whom I cited. On my opponent's round 2 case, I dealt with that in round 2, and my opponent did not respond - he dropped it, not me. Green Less pollutants is needed - so why is con supporting a power generation system that creates 12.3 million kilograms of pollutants for his country alone? Preventing climate change is a start, but not polluting other aspects of the environment is part of environmentalism too. Just ask Lucy Lawless and her Arctic buddies. My opponent continuously reasserts that nuclear is safe, but he does so only by citing lobby group articles, when I have cited scientific research showing the opposite. He has given no responses to any of these. I have shown other alternatives (green energy), and that it is not the presence of alternatives that constitutes a ban, but the danger of the waste produced by nuclear. About the CO2 graph, I talked about CO2 in rounds 2 and 3 already, my opponent is still trying to get me to repeat myself. Finally, con claims my arguments are circular. Obviously he does not know what a circular argument is. None of my premises have made it into my conclusions. Anybody who has the vaguest understanding of formal logic will be able to see that. And then to claim that I haven't attempted to counter his refutations shows that he clearly hasn't even read any of my round 2 case and is just making stuff up. It's time that the world woke up to the dangers of nuclear energy. We cannot support a system that creates so much un-necessary waste when there are so many better alternatives available. That's why I'm proud to affirm the motion. Vote pro! Sources 1 - goo.gl/0dm6a 2 - goo.gl/Ami4W 3 - goo.gl/YqHlE"	PRO	186
Sb4dd79ae-A5b665004	Nuclear Energy	There once was a saying that went something like this. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Clearly, this is not the case for neither my opponent, nor myself. The non-renewable bubbas are quick to dismiss anything positive, and exacerbate anything negative that would threaten their cash flow. Welcome to modified capitalosm. Voting issues: 1. There is no doubt that nuclear energy works. 2. Likewise, there is no doubt that there ae inherent dangers associated with nuclear, and we have yet to discover a feasible way to dispose of the toxic waste without further endangering lives and ecology. 3. Start up costs clearly make it prohibitive for much of the world. 4. As only a handful can afford it, nuclear constitutes only 16%. This deduces that 84% comes from alternative sources. I have demonstrated that the 3 headed renewable energies, wind, hydro, and solar, are indeed efficiient, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. I went on to make the ddo community further aware of the possibility of magnetic energy. While still in it's infancy, should magnetic energy blossom, everyone, everyone could benefit from this discovery. Yes it is a monetary threat to the Haliburtons of the world, yet they too could prosper by among the first to expand this invention. Conclusion. My opponent outlined the merits of nuclear energy and attempted to minimize the effects of it's toxic waste. I have demonstrated viable alternatives. I would like to thank my opponent Ore_Ele for a good discussion that if read widescale, it could open eyes at the highest levels of the people who make our decisions.	CON	187
See0f4916-A68ccf55	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	Fossil fuels are a finite resource. According to the BBC on June 29, 2010, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the recession is causing even West Virginia coal miners to re-think status quo fuels. 2. Traditional renewable energy is insufficient to meet America's energy needs. According to Dr. Daniel LaGatta on February 16, 2010, the U.S. cannot meet its energy needs by 2035 without at least 40 new nuclear plants. 3. Some form of nuclear power is inevitable. According to the Texas Tribune on June 28, 2010, more than $18 billion is currently being spent on developing nuclear power plants, and Congress is considering adding another $9 billion. A review done by the Department of Energy in 2008 found that there are 108 nuclear plants in operation in the U.S. 4. Status quo nuclear technologies create thousands of tons of radioactive waste. According to National Geographic in 2002, there is currently 52,000 tons of highly toxic waste in the U.S. 5. Despite his promise to scrub the project, President Obama recently lost a lawsuit challenging the current plan to store the waste in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. According to the New York Times on June 29, 2010, although the Yucca plan still faces significant hurdles, it is still highly likely that the project will continue. 6. Unfortunately, the Yucca Mountain area contains an active volcano range. According to the New Scientist in 2002, if a volcano were to erupt, the magma would burst into the storage tunnels underneath the facility, sending radioactive magma several miles into the sky. 7. A nuclear volcano would have devastating consequences. According to Dr. David Camarow, if a volcano near Yucca Mountain were to errupt, it would contaminate and sterilize the entire biosphere. Even if the risk is extremely low, we cannot risk the survival of the human race. 8. Thus I present the following plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives by funding the development of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). 9. The IFR is an entirely different form of nuclear power. According to Dr. George Stanford in 2001, the IFR uses spent nuclear waste as fuel. This will allow the IFR to burn waste and old decommissioned nuclear warheads, and prevent the need to store waste in Yucca Mountain. 10. The IFR was a pilot project terminated in 1994, despite being only three years away from completion. According to Dr. George Stanford in 2001, the IFR is a proven technology, but only needs funding to complete the prototype. Once the prototype is complete, construction can being on a mass scale, replacing the use of traditional nuclear power. 11. There are several other advantages to implementing IFR technology. According to the London Guardian in 2008, more than 1 billion people have insufficient water supplies, causing millions of deaths each year and millions of dollars of drought damage in the United States. However, according to Dr. Robert Pfeffer in 2001, a small nuclear power plant could create millions of gallons of fresh water as a by-product of the cooling process. 12. Although there are some signs of recovery, the economic recession is still continuing. According to the American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness in 2006, nuclear power can generate billions of dollars of economic growth and thousands of high paying jobs would be created in the U.S. 13. Another factor in prolonging the recession is the loss of cheap energy. However, according to Dr. James Hylko in 2008, nuclear power is one of the most cost effective forms of energy at 1.6 cents per kilowatt hour.	PRO	188
Sf074f79e-A932c5eb7	Nuclear Power	Sorry for the incoherent nature of the opening statement i should have defined it as a look at large scale nuclear power station, as my primary example of nuclear power. In response to the first point you have produced nuclear power and the bi-products of the process as one and the same and the use of word i would reinforce my point as that the lack of nuclear power being developed as a primary source of energy, has allowed the production of energy from fossil fuels has caused more pollution, Carbon and sulfur emissions from fossil fuels causing acid rain, and the absorption of Carbon dioxide into water cause changes in pH damaging ecosystems. Whereas the only radioactive waste products from nuclear fission based reactor technology has had a relatively small impact globally. I would also state the define that by stating in your response that nuclear technology is an abstract idea seem to be come confusion for you for as far as I'm aware nuclear technology is and has been a reality for over 60 years now, and hence it is no longer an idea. I argue that the power which can be produced from a nuclear reactor is worth producing the radioactive waste. In response to your second point If you can reference a majority of points which show global damage done by these accidents at nuclear reactors, then i will cede my point. However, as the only major incidents in history of nuclear power are Chernobyl and Green Mile Island, in these incidents radioactive materials were dispersed into the atmosphere, however asides from in the locality of the incidents no long term damage has been proven. I will aslo like to preempt that the incidents with nuclear reactors in Japan can not be contributed to flaws in the nuclear technology but due to extreme damage caused by a random act of God. I would also hasten to point out that the amount of incidents that involve in death of work or costs over $540000 dollars is not confined to the nuclear industry but is common place in oil industries, i need only quote the deep water horizon incident in which lives of works were lost, and the cost of clean-up into billions of dollars, likewise the damage to the ecosystem is severe. And finally in response to your third point i would argue that in order for you to win on this point you would have to present a feasible technology that could produce power of the same magnitude as that produce by nuclear reactor technology. As such wind power and most renewable sources cannot produce energy on large scales, which would sensibly be defined as over 25% of a countries energy consumption.	PRO	189
See0f4916-A414606b6	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"My opponent says that I have the burden to show the necessity for shifting resources to IFR's, and that the current recession shows the impacts of excessive deficit spending, and that taking away coal and oil incentives will cause the free market to seek alternative energy. I'll take his points in turn: a. On our respective burdens: I have the burden to prove the resolution true. But if my opponent makes an argument against my position, he has the burden to prove HIS argument is true. Until his housing/recession argument, he had failed to do so. Now that he has, I'll answer it. Otherwise, he has yet to give EVIDENCE, WARRANTS, or PROOF for any of his arguments. b. On the housing collapse/recession: He makes a fatal mistake here. He concedes that the housing market caused the economy to collapse. But it wasn't government intervention that caused the housing collapse – it was the belief in the ""free market"". According to conservative federal judge and law and economics expert Richard Posner, ""Rational maximization by businessmen and consumers, all pursuing their self-interest more or less intelligently within a framework of property and contract rights, can set the stage for an economic collapse… A profound failure of the market was abetted by governmental inaction...The movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience -- the self-healing powers -- of laissez-faire capitalism."" Thus, his argument actually flows AGAINST him – his only example of the failure of excessive deficit spending actually proves that the free market and LACK of government intervention caused the housing crisis and the ensuing recession. c. On eliminating subsidies and free markets finding alternative energy He does not understand my point. My point in the status quo, we are developing traditional nuclear power. This will create nuclear waste. This waste WILL be stored in Yucca Mountain. There are no other alternatives, according to the New York Times. Even if we don't need nuclear power as a fuel, we need IFR's to avoid a nuclear volcano. 2. My opponent says that I need to talk about all forms of alternative energy, that I need to focus on whether the federal government is a beneficial actor, and that the federal government acting would be unconstitutional, immoral, and anti-social. I'll take his points in turn: a. Scope of the resolution My opponent says that I need to talk about all forms of alternative energy. I argue that proving one example proves the resolution. This is simple to resolve: when he restates the resolution, he puts the word ""all"" in brackets – THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE TOPIC. I don't have to prove ""all"" incentives. He completely ignores my analysis on Point 2 in Round 3, where I argue that in-depth education is preferable to broad education. My interpretation of the topic is therefore superior to his. b. Government Action/Trade-Off: My opponent argues that there are many beneficial things we can do with our tax revenue. But look back at his posts: he never answers my argument that investing in IFR's will actually INCREASE revenue. I cited the American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness, which says that billions of dollars of tax revenue can be generated with new nuclear plants. Thus, even if there is a general trade-off between government priorities, and even if our deficit spending is limited (which it is not, see above), there will be no trade-off because IFR's are revenue generating for the federal government. And yet he has still failed to PROVE that a trade-off WILL happen. c. Propriety of Government Action: My opponent says that I have to demonstrate why it is the responsibility of the federal government to fund IFR's and interfere in the market. On the issue of responsibility, it is the legal obligation of the federal government, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to create a long term national plan for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste. Because IFR's satisfy that burden as an alternative to the otherwise inevitable Yucca Mountain, that proves that it is a federal responsibility. Additionally, the federal government can do things, even if it doesn't have an OBLIGATION to do them. That's my ""necessary and proper"" argument from Round 3. On the issue of market interference, I have made several points so far he has yet to answer: i. There is market interference now, yet we have yet to see a harmful impact. HE HAS PROVIDED NO IMPACTS TO INTERFERING WITH THE FREE MARKET. Because this is his argument against me, he has the burden to show that interfering with the market is bad. ii. We can still use the free market, just not a ""pure"" free market. Free markets and government incentives are not mutually exclusive. iii. The free market is a terrible mechanism. See below. 3. My opponent argues that the free market is the best way to achieve our desired outcomes. I have several points: a. First, he ignores my four specific warrants as to why the free market will lead to global environmental destruction. These are all reasons why the free market is bad and will eventually lead to terrible catastrophe: i. The tech revolution had put massive strain on the environment ii. The consumption movement has depleted our planet's natural resources iii. American consumption of beef is ravaging our ecosystem iv. Free markets fail to properly value our environment, and thus prevent the formation of an effective ecological movement b. Next, he argues that China's transition to a market economy proves that capitalism has given them prosperity. Yet, this example just proves that capitalism will lead to ecological destruction (see above). According to Wang Yi, a Chinese scholar writing in Social Research, Vol. 73, No. 1 in Spring of 2006, China's transition to a market economy has created a huge ecological crisis, with pollution of the air and water, and depletion of natural resources. The only way for China to avert a major catastrophe is to revert to some government pollution controls. This just proves that the ""pure"" free market can't solve, and some government will always be necessary. Giving incentives to IFR's is one such instance. c. My opponent argues that my examples of government intervention in creating the internet and the NIH were issues of popular concern, and that this is more important than alternative energy. However, according to a poll conducted in March of 2010 by independent agency Bisconti Research, 70% of Americans support building new nuclear power plants, and 87% feel that nuclear energy will play an important role in our energy future. In comparison, a June 2009 Pew Opinion poll found that 55% of Americans want to reduce or maintain current defense spending, and a March 2010 Gallup/USA Today poll found 40% of Americans thought the health care reform bill was a ""bad idea"". But the most damning for my opponent (from the March 2010 Bisconti survey): ""THE SURVEY SHOWED STRONG SUPPORT (79 PERCENT) FOR RECYCLING USED FUEL FROM NUCLEAR ENERGY FACILITIES TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT MUST BE PERMANENTLY DISPOSED."" Game over… d. Finally, he argues that if IFR's were so great, then the private sector would have funded them. I would point out that he has ignored my point that IFR's are not ""immediately"" profitable, and that the free market will ignore any technology that doesn't produce a foreseeable profit. According to Dr. Charles Till, because other fuels like oil and coal are so much cheaper, IFR's don't make current sense to capitalists, even if they'll be beneficial in the long term."	PRO	190
S9bc8d269-A63f9d4fa	Nuclear power is a more potent and efficient source of energy.	A very small amount of Uranium can produce a massive quantity of energy. This compares favorably to solar power, in which a very large amount of sunlight is required to produce a much smaller quantity of energy. Nuclear energy is more efficient in this way.	PRO	191
Sf074f877-A761cfc1f	Nuclear Power	"Thanks, Smooosh! I. Uranium Mining Most of my opponent's argumentation has to do with uranium mining. He argues at various points that it is environmentally hazardous and unsafe, though these issues are somewhat interrelated. He also suggests that the finite nature of uranium makes nuclear a non-renewable resources. It is important therefore to explain the real impact of uranium mining moving forward. A. Breeder Reactors Breeder reactors are reactors which produce more fissile material than they consume, allowing some of the produced fissile material to be reused as fuel. Imagine if I could produce ten units of energy, from a single unit. I can then use one of the ten units I created to create an additional ten units, and so on. The system feeds itself. [1] This kind of reactor has the potential to substantially reduce the need for uranium mining in the future because it can recycle its own fuel. Breeder reactors are 100x more efficient than other kinds of reactors, and ""in fact can supply all the world's energy needs at present costs."" [2] Russia, China, and India are all actively pursuing this technology, and it has already been deployed in various facilities around the world (e.g. Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Plant). [1] Rapid investment in and development of this kind of reactor could solve the vast majority of the harms Pro talks about by drastically cutting demand for uranium. Breeder reactors also solve for sustainability. ""It is frequently said that the amount of uranium available can support the world's energy needs for only about 1000 years. Under this definition, nuclear fission is not a very long-term energy source. Such arguments ignore the fact that usual estimates of the world's uranium resources refer to quantities available at the current market price of about $40 per pound...However, if used in breeder reactors, the cost/kWh is reduced by more than a factor of 100, so one can afford to use much more expensive uranium. For example, uranium costing $1000/lb would contribute only 0.03 cents/kW-h to the cost of electricity and would thus represent less than 1 % of the total cost. At that price, the fuel cost would be equivalent to that of gasoline priced at a half cent per gallon."" [2] Taking into account various sources of uranium, my source finds that ""all the world's energy requirements for the remaining 5""10^9 yrs of existence of life on Earth could be provided by breeder reactors without the cost of electricity rising b as much as 1% due to fuel costs. This is consistent with the definition of a 'renewable' energy source in the sense in which that term is generally used."" [2] B. Research & Data If you refer back to my last speech, you will find some evidence from the OECD, which accounts for both the ""direct and indirect"" impacts of nuclear power on pollution. These indirect effects explicitly consider uranium mining. The report states, ""there are some indirect emissions that can be attributed to nuclear energy, principally due to the use of fossil-based energy sources in the various steps of the nuclear fuel cycle (for example, during uranium mining)."" Despite factoring in uranium mining, the reports nevertheless concludes that nuclear power is cleaner than coal, natural gas, biomass, solar, and hydropower energy. [3] Pro does a lot to tell us how uranium mining pollutes the environment, but he never puts forth any empirical data which compare the polluting effects of uranium mining against the environmental clean benefits of nuclear plants. This data shows that, when all elements of the nuclear energy chain are considered, nuclear power still benefits the environment. II. Cost Savings A. Levelized Costs Pro says that we should assess the cost of nuclear power using ""levelized costs."" I agree, which is why the data I cited used levelized costs. I repeat my study's findings: ""Nuclear power has a lower levelized cost than advanced coal with carbon capture, conventional combustion turbine, biomass, offshore wind, photovoltaic solar, and thermal solar."" [4] The very method Pro says is most credible supports the Con position. B. Bailouts Honestly, I don't see how this is relevant. Firstly, it's just non-unique. Fossil fuels and renewables are all heavily reliant on government subsidies and assistance. Consider that ""[m]ost renewable energy industries are heavily dependent on government subsidies, and without constant taxpayer support, many renewable energy industries cannot survive. Both American and British renewable energy companies have failed when policymakers decrease subsidies."" [5] Secondly, given how cheap nuclear is, it stands a good chance of eventually being able to ease of the subsidies, particularly once the fossil fuel industry began to fade in earnest. Thirdly, why are bailouts necessarily bad? Keeping energy prices down for consumers with subsidies benefits the entire economy, because there is no sector of the economy which does not rely on energy. Cheaper energy thus puts more money in firms pockets so that they can grow, boosting the economy. III. Obsolete or Necessary? Pro cites the Tesla Powerwall as an example of a soon-to-be ""mainstream option for home energy consumers."" This struck me as rather perplexing for several reasons. Firstly, we're not just talking about modernized countries with homes capable of accommodating such technologies and homeowners capable of buying them. Secondly, it's not clear that this technology will be able to make up from a loss of nuclear power any time soon. In the US, the Paolo Verde nuclear plant, which has three reactors, is capable of 94,488 MWh. If we divide this by three to approximate a single reactor, and then convert it to KWh, we get this number: 31,496,000 KWh. [6] Tesla's best model, by comparison, can manage 250 KWh. [7] In other words, a single nuclear reactor can produce about 126,000x the energy. As of right now, the 2,500 Powerwalls in existence seem nowhere close to being able to fill the void Pro is hoping they'll fill. And this just isn't about the Powerwalls, novel as they are. The evidence I have shown repeatedly illustrates that nuclear plants fill a void that alternatives just can't--either because those alternatives are unable to produce sufficient quantities of energy or because of intermittency. Pro also claims that renewables will likely continue to improve apace; that's possible, but not guaranteed. But it is equally possible that nuclear power will also become ""more efficient and less expensive,"" particularly as technologies like breeder reactors revolutionize the industry. Finally, Pro concedes that renewables like wind and solar are intermittent, but seems to miss the part where I show that nuclear power plants can run at 90% capacity year-round. [8] Therefore, nuclear plants don't require back-up generators, unlike wind and solar. IV. Miscellaneous A. Terrorism Pro cites literally no case of nuclear terrorism happening, nor does he offer any data on how likely it might be to happen. But, let's talk about some specific risks. Firstly, cyberterrorists could conceivably cause a meltdown, but only if all security protocols (including emergency shutdowns) were penetrated. Even then, it is unclear if a meltdown would kill anyone, because nearby communities are often well-trained to respond to a meltdown situation [9] and because only 1 meltdown has every resulted in fatalities. Secondly, there is the risk of a physical assault on a power plant, leading to a meltdown--which again brings up the issue of whether a meltdown would result in fatalities. Thirdly, Pro worries about ""inside jobs."" But, employees would likely undergo extreme vetting, making these unlikely. Finally, another fear would be terrorists stealing material to make a dirty bomb or similar device. Yet, most of the damage from a dirty bomb would be confined to the immediate area of the explosion (less than a city block up to a few square miles), and radiation levels would likely be so low that they would not pose any immediate health risks. Plus, such bombs would emit gamma radiation which is readily detectable. [10] In other words, these devices are little more lethal than conventional explosives. B. Thermal Pollution Pro makes a completely unsubstantiated and offhand comment about thermal pollution. In fact, thermal pollution is basically irrelevant. ""The study analyzes whether the magnitude and distribution of thermal pollution is sufficient to be a meaningful contributor to global and regional climate change...The authors find that, in total, the magnitude of the thermal pollution around the globe is very small (nearly negligible) in comparison to estimates of the influence of the 'greenhouse effect'."" [11] C. Drops Pro drops quite a few of my key arguments, including: Nuclear Power and Medicine, Nuclear Power and Vehicles, and Nuclear Power and Space Exploration. Pro never directly responds to my data showing that nuclear power kills fewer people per terawatt hour than other energy sources or to the fact that nuclear meltdowns seem to be getting rarer. He also never even mentions the France example. D. Time Pro says he doesn't want immediate implementation. But, remember, emissions must drop 80% by 2050 to avert a GW catastrophe. If he can't show that alternatives can achieve this without nuclear, he incurs those harms. And if he truly believes nuclear is net contributor of pollution, he should want to stop them sooner rather than later to avert that threshold. V.

S1ff2ec96-A21a04fa	The united states federal government should offer tax incentives for offshore wind turbines	"To answer and refute my opponents statement: A) No ships for construction? Increasing demand for offshore wind means that an offshore wind building crew will be established by businesses who want to take advantage of this new industry. No site here, just basic capitalism at work since supply eventually meets demand. Siemens and other corporations have met the European demand, all that these corporations have to do is expand, which is a really easy thing for corporations to do. They will not create these turbines if we don't incentivize them. B)onshore wind? Only offshore wind can prevent climate change Thaler 12 http://papers.ssrn.com...; ninety percent stronger and more consistent over water than - land, with higher power densities and lower shear and turbulence,13 America’s offshore resources can provide more than our current electricity use.14 Moreover, these resources are near many major cities that are home to much of the population and electricity demand thereby “reducing the need for new high-voltage transmission from the Midwest and Great Plains to serve coastal lands so basicly, onshore wind may be cheaper now since it's already implemented, offshore wind offers greater potential energy without creating co2 emmissions. economies of scale will make offshore wind cheaper. Clarke et al, 9 http://offshorewind.net... Offshore wind farms are more expensive to build and maintain than onshore systems. According to the U.S. DOE 20% Wind Energy by 2030 report, the capital costs for offshore wind farms are estimated at $2,400/kW (in 2006 dollars) compared with $1,650/kW for land-based wind projects. Windpower Monthly notes that information on the cost of offshore wind power facilities continues to be sparse. 81 Based on limited data available from completed offshore projects, this publication estimates that a fully-installed offshore wind system will cost as much as €3,300/kW ($4,600/kW) compared with €1,700/kW ($2,400/kW) for landbased. These figures include the cost of the turbines, as well as installation and maintenance. Despite the increased costs associated with building and operating turbines in ocean and lake environments, there are several factors that make offshore wind development extremely attractive. Benefits include a more robust and consistent wind resource, and the ability to host ever-larger turbines (approaching 10 MW) and more expansive multi-turbine projects (with installed capacities of 1,000-3,000 MW). Economies of scale can offset, at least partially, the higher initial capital costs. Also, one of the most important economic benefits of wind power (both land-based and offshore) is that it reduces energy price risk. Once wind farms are operational, the fuel cost is zero (in contrast to the high price volatility of fossil fuels). Finally, for a number of states along the East Coast and Great Lakes, offshore wind offers the best—or only—opportunity to develop utility-scale renewable energy projects. The great potential benefits of offshore wind energy warrant its serious economic analysis. Global warming/environment The status quo and alternative to offshore wind is coal, which is bad for the enviornment green peace 14 http://www.greenpeace.org...

The nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, mercury, and dozens of other hazardous substances that come from coal combustion can lead to not only respiratory ailments, but also cardiovascular and nervous system disorders.

Coal-burning power plants emit more than 30% of the USâ€™s global warming pollution. Coal mining includes more fatal injuries than any other American industry. Each year, up to 36,000 Americans die as a result of air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Nearly one in ten American children has asthma. Coal-fired power plants cause 554,000 asthma attacks every year. Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, mercury, and dozens of other hazardous substances that come from coal combustion can lead to not only respiratory ailments, but also cardiovascular and nervous system disorders. Cities with high concentrations of nitrogen oxides, a compound produced in coal combustion, have death rates four times higher than those with low concentrations, which suggests a potential correlation. Children are at particular risk from the mercury emissions from coal. According to Physicians for Social Responsibility, every year between 300,000 and 630,000 American children are born with blood mercury levels so high that they underperform on neurodevelopmental tests and face lifelong loss of intelligence. Look the fact is, we can't regulate how China get's their resources but we can regulate how we use their resources. Even the the mining costs of offshore wind and coal are similar, in the end, which is more sustainable and which one is burnt away in a constant cycle. coal ash is radioactive scientific america 7 http://www.scientificamerican.com... coal ash(emissions from coal) also emit radioactive nuclear minerals such as uranium into the atmosphere. An area around a coal factory is proven to be 100 times more radioactive then then an area near nuclear power plants. Ok,your right about methane, this is exactly why we need to curb pollution now so we don't cross the methane artic melting and so the perpetual cycle doesn't start. We're nearing the tipping point so we need to stop now! http://www.climatecentral.org... Rare earths disadvantage: from your negatives source: ""While nuclear storage remains an important issue for many U.S. environmentalists, few are paying attention to the wind industry’s less efficient and less transparent use of radioactive material via rare earth mineral excavation in China. The U.S. nuclear industry employs numerous safeguards to ensure that spent nuclear fuel is stored safely."" The fact is, yes, China's rare earth mining does create radioactive waste. But China will need to be pressured by the international community in order to reduce their reactivity and reprocess or potentially store the radioactive waste. This is not a fault of the affirmative, but merely a flaw within the system of which the pro must solve for. In increasing our demand for these rare earths, we should also pressure China to get rid of this sludge. Conclusion: If you vote pro, you are voting to solve global warming which is on the brink from methane hydrates, we avoid the rare earths disadvantage since this problem is external of the plan. This disadvantage can also be solved for with effective international policy. My plan doesn't cause radiation, but merely perpetuates a system that does. We try to end or regulate this system, which i agree with, but that doesn't mean You should vote negative based on this outside effect. If you vote neg, we will all eminently fail to solve global warming, radiation, and other impacts. Global warming needs to stop now from the negatives evidence which states that there will be artic methane emission. Using my evidence, the methane emission will only be released when a 2.5 celsius increase in global temperatures occurs, which means that we have to stop and curb emissions now or methane emissions will increase and warming will accelerate. Yes, these offshore wind turbines will be slightly costlier than coal, but coal has much more social cost then offshore wind. Global warming will lead to mass extinction. vote pro."	PRO	193
See0f4916-Ac31fe28f	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	Although the affirmative may have typed 13 bullet points, he has yet provided any significant argument or evidence to demonstrate why the federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives. I will first summarize my opponent's arguments and show that governmental intervention in the free economy of energy development is undesirable. According to the affirmative, both nuclear energy and IFR are potential solutions to our inevitable energy crisis in the near future. I agree with that. He further details the superiority and benefits of IFR over nuclear energy. I agree with that as well. In fact, I will even accept the notion that the development and maintenance of nuclear plants can provide both economic growth and employment opportunities. With that said, he has stated little justification why the federal government must substantially increase alternative energy incentives outside of the free market mechanism in the midst of economic recession. Firstly, little evidences have ever supported the claim that government could artificially create or eliminate the supply and demand of any particular product or service. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provides much tax credits to various renewable energy ventures. Once a promising frontier of both technological advancement and economic development, many renewable projects are now halted as the RENIXX Renewable Energy Industrial Index falls to its five years low to €576.25 once the immediate concern of energy prices retreats from the public spotlight. No single market participant, not even the government, can force the prosperity of any particular sector without the support of the broader economic cycle. Therefore, any governmental incentives are likely to prove futile over the long run. Secondly, the affirmative fails to explain why the alternative energy industry should receive substantial incentives over other equally important social initiatives. Governmental funding to healthcare, defense, education and welfare programs has been reduced substantially in recent years. While welfare and healthcare needs may be more immediate, education holds the key to long-term prosperity. Without comparison and basis of showing the importance of energy over other economic concerns, no citizen or government can blindly support the affirmative's baseless claim in the midst of a recession. Most importantly, the affirmative has failed to demonstrate the necessity of bypassing the free market mechanism when plenty of private sector support will be available at the right moment. Energy is an important aspect of life to the citizens as individuals and as a nation. Our nation has well-developed market of private companies supplying the majority of energy in this country while maintaining stability and balance of the energy market within the context of the invisible hands. In conclusion, the affirmative has failed to demonstrate why the federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives while creating more financial strain on the federal balance sheet and focusing less on other equally important issues. Although energy stability is important, the affirmative has failed to provide any evidence demonstrating the necessity of breaching of the free market mechanism. Therefore, I strongly disagree with my opponent and urge you to vote against his claim.	CON	194

Sb3cf5511-A8b6d031f	Resolved: On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks.	"In order, I will address: framework and then my opponent's case. I. Framework: 1. Extend my framework where I reserve the power of fiat for the negative. 2. While I agree that my opponent must show net benefits, I would argue that specific examples (such as Three Mile Island) should be utilized for two reasons: Reason One: The resolution calls for potential risks. By definition, a risk indicates a “possibility of loss or injury.” While obviously not every single nuclear power plant will meltdown at some point its lifetime, it's possible that some will. As such, the impacts of such possibilities must be weighed. Reason Two: In order to ensure a fair debate. My opponent is trying to nullify some of the Con's warrants by stealthily framing the debate to give the Pro an unfair advantage – please do not be fooled. II. Affirmative Case: AC1: Nuclear Energy is the Best Way to Reduce Carbon Emissions NR1: Nuclear Energy Emits More Carbon Than Viable Alternatives TURN – a meta analysis of nuclear plant life done by Benjamin K. Sovacool, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore, found that “nuclear power (at 66 gCO2e/kWh emissions) emits twice as much carbon as solar photovoltaic, at 32 gCO2e/kWh, and six times as much as onshore wind farms, at 10 gCO2e/kWh.” My opponent asserts that nuclear energy is the best way to reduce carbon emissions but according to Sovacool, “Things like energy efficiency, and some of the cheaper renewables are a factor of six better. So for every dollar you spend on nuclear, you could have saved five or six times as much carbon with efficiency, or wind farms.” At the point where alternatives are viable and offer less harms, it's clear that nuclear power's risks don't outweigh – an assertion that will expanded upon throughout this round. NR2. Nuclear Energy Doesn't Solve Excessive Carbon Emissions Even if you don't buy my first response, understand that according to the Wall Street Journal, “Nuclear power isn't a solution to global warming. Rather, global warming is just a convenient rationale for an obsolete energy source that makes no sense when compared to the alternatives.” The WSJ furthers, “The sheer number of nuclear plants needed to make a major dent in greenhouse emissions means the industry hasn't a prayer of turning nuclear power into the solution to global warming. One study from last year determined that to make a significant contribution toward stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide, about 21 new 1,000-megawatt plants would have to be built each year for the next 50 years, including those needed to replace existing reactors, all of which are expected to be retired by 2050. That's considerably more than the most ambitious industry growth projections.” NR3. Nuclear Energy Is Not Renewable My opponent asserts that nuclear energy is “the best renewable energy option for the United States.” However, Nathan Shedroff of the California College of Arts explains, “Uranium sources are just as finite as other fuel sources, such as coal, natural gas, etc.” Furthermore, NGO CSEF found that “Nuclear energy is not a renewable because [it] uses Uranium as fuel, which is a scarce resource and is expected to last only for the next 30 to 60 years.” AC2: Nuclear Energy Reduces Terrorism NR1: Nuclear Power Doesn't Solve U.S. Oil Dependence This is true for two reasons. Reason One: Oil Is a Fungible Commodity With A Single Global Market Extend my WSJ evidence where I tell you nuclear power plants take years, if not decades, to build. Understand that my opponent's terrorist impact hinges on the fact that nuclear power will replace oil quickly and efficiently enough to hold tangible significance. Given nuclear power's negative economic impacts, the thriving oil market, and said construction times, it's improbable that nuclear energy will replace oil as the U.S.' staple means of generating power – to the extent where not switching to nuclear energy will have minimal impact of state sponsors of terrorism. Reason Two: Energy Independence Isn't Feasible Nor Desirable TURN: Pundit Shikha Dalmia explains that the notion of “replacing oil with alternative fuels will create ""millions of jobs"" and, once again, put America on the road to riches” is a common misconception. In fact, Dalmia states “Trying to fight this reality won't create jobs or restore America's economy, it'll do the opposite.” She points to Nixon's crusade for energy independence, noting that oil importing actually increased by 27%. Let us also understand that Third World countries in Latin America and Asia also tried to achieve energy independence by adopting a policy known as “import-substitution,” where – through massive subsidies, these nations attempted to bolster domestic production by discouraging the importation of key industrial products. In the end, import-substitution “raised production costs, making Third World goods uncompetitive in the global markets and prohibitively expensive at home, consigning these countries to decades and decades of economic stagnation that has not yet been fully reversed. Delinking America from global energy markets will wreak similar economic havoc.” Understand that in order to extend my opponent's terrorism impact, he must first show that nuclear power does solve U.S. oil dependence because otherwise – there would be no reason for the United States to turn to nuclear power instead of following the status quo. Given these two reasons, we can see that Pro's terrorist impact can't actually be extended. However, even if you don't buy any of my evidence or logic, look to my second response (NR2) where I turn his terrorist impact. NR2: Energy Independence Would Aid Terrorism This is true for two reasons. Reason One: Discourage Middle Eastern Aid in Counter-terrorism According to the Reason Foundation, “But will energy independence make America more secure by depriving terrorist nations of petro dollars? Not really. Indeed, insofar as America, the single biggest oil consumer, spurns Middle Eastern oil, it will only make it that much cheaper—and therefore more attractive than the alternatives—for everyone else, including India, China and other energy-hungry emerging markets. The result might well be a new geo-political alignment with countries dependent on Middle Eastern oil in one camp—and ""energy-independent"" America in the other. This is not a recipe for defunding terrorism. Rather, it is a way of giving Middle Eastern countries even less of a stake in our well being and making them less interested in helping our struggle against terrorism.” Given the utmost importance of Middle Eastern support in counter-terrorism, we have to understand that turning to nuclear power wouldn't reduce terrorism – as my opponent suggests, but would actually increase it as counter-terrorism would be hampered. Reason Two: Incentivize Further Support of Terrorism If the U.S. stopped importing oil from states such as Russia, two incentives would be created in order to further said terrorism. First, these states would be losing a significant amount of revenue. Russia, for example, relies on crude oil as one of its main exports. With this in mind, it would benefit Russia to increase arms sales to terrorists – in order to: 1. make up for lost revenue on oil sales 2. harm the United States. States that seek to challenge the status quo, such as Russia, have an added incentive to do so – as knocking down the U.S. from its hegemonic status would be a bonus. States such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq share similar goals. NR3: Most of the U.S.' Top Oil Import Locations Do Not Sponsor Terrorism Even if you don't buy NR2, understand that out of the U.S.' top oil import locations, none are on the U.S. state sponsor of terrorism list, and only 3 (Saudia Arabia, Russia, and Iraq) are alleged supporters of terrorism. Due to character limitations, I will focus on defending my case in the next round – whilst extending my rebuttals."	CON	199
Sdd09931a-A828e62bf	Resolved: The United States should Significantly Increase its Use of Nuclear Energy	"Before we look at my opponent's arguments that nuclear energy is a process that produces carbon emissions, let's first look at some key facts: 1. Nuclear power plants generate about 20 percent of U.S. electricity. They do not burn anything when producing electricity, so they do not produce any combustion byproducts. By substituting for other fuels in electricity production, nuclear energy has significantly reduced U.S. emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. 2. In 2006, U.S. nuclear power plants reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide—pollutants controlled under the Clean Air Act—by 1 million short tons and 3.1 million short tons, respectively. The amount of nitrogen oxide emissions that nuclear plants prevent an-nually is the equivalent of taking more than 51 million passenger cars off the road. 3. Also in 2006, U.S. nuclear plants prevented the discharge of 681 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is nearly as much carbon dioxide as is released from all U.S. passenger cars. As a matter of fact, between 1995-2007, U.S. nuclear plants prevented the discharge of at least 600 million metric tons of CO2 per year. 4. Generating 1 million killowatt hours produces 996 metric tons of carbon dioxide from a coal-fired plant, 809 metric tons of carbon dioxide from an oil-fired plant, 476 metric tons of carbon dioxide from a natural gas-fired plant, and none from a nuclear power plant. Now to address my opponent's argument: there is no method of producing electricity that in the manufacturing process, product aquisition process (mining, transporting, etc.), and maintenance process will not depend on fossile fuels. Nuclear energy is, again, only one component of energy independence in America, and it does not address fossil fuel burning vehicles. However, neither do the other methods of producing clean electricity. It is also important to point out that the processes you are speaking of are not continuous with nuclear energy. Uranium mining does not occur in the US at the frequency which, for example, coal mining does, nor do fuel rods get spent as often as coal is burned. For example, a University of Wisconsin study found that nuclear energy's life-cycle emissions are 17 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalents per gigawatt-hour. Only wind and geothermal sources ranked lower, at 14 and 15 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalents per gigawatt-hour, respectively. Now, it is important to note that clean energy accounts for only 27% of US energy, nuclear power accounting for 20% of that. Though nuclear energy cannot be the only alternative to fossil fuels, it is a very important piece of the pie, as I have mentioned before. In a transition from fossil fuels to clean energy- given the lack of solar, wind, and hydroelectric plants already in place (they account for a combined 7% of clean energy in America)- nuclear power would be a major pivot point. Regarding my opponent's argument on efficiency, let me first start by stating his argument does not contradict my own. If nuclear energy production takes up 20% more of America's energy needs by 2050, that will be a 100% increase from now, and nuclear energy would then account for 40% of America's electricity generation. In his own argument, full production of solar and wind would bring the ""other"" number up to 39% of America's electricity needs. That would mean that by 2050, 79% of America's electricity would be clean. That would mean that by 2050 we would be producing nearly 80% less carbon emissions. That's a great number, yet my opponent provides this info as if it would be a bad thing. My argument is not for competition between clean energy sources. Making a significant increase in nuclear energy production does not mean we cannot have a bigger increase in other clean energy sources. That is the idea. As for availability, Current usage is about 65,000 tU/yr. Thus the world's present measured resources of uranium (5.5 Mt) in the cost category somewhat below present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors, are enough to last for over 80 years. Exploration has been at it's lowest levels between 1985-2005. With the recent increase in exploration and renewed world interest it is only a matter of time before supply and demand equal out. Even now with uranium at it's highest spot prices, nuclear plants are the lowest-cost producer of baseload electricity. The average production cost of 1.76 cents per kilowatt-hour includes the costs of operating and maintaining the plant, purchasing fuel and paying for the management of used fuel. Storage: It is obvious safe storage should be a primary objective in the development of nuclear energy. Significantly increasing the use of nuclear energy requires the develpment of sustainable storage and recycling technologies. The only proponent who denies this requirement is John McCain.

S57476c56-A854fe589	government should intervene in the transition to alternative fuels	"No. Yes, the market will take care of it. Currently, non-renewable sources, especially natural gas, is the cheapest form of energy according to the EPA (http://www.eia.gov...), and that won't change in the near future. Some renewable sources will catch up, but the majority will still be more expensive than non-renewable sources. Also if you take a look at the mill/kWh of different energy sources from 2002-2012 (http://www.eia.gov...), you can see that natural gas even declined in price over thise period, whereas all other mentioned resources, renewable and non-renewable, increased by up to 80%. Secondly, if the government should intervene, my question to you is how. Monetary, or by introducing new legislature? I'd like to remind you that if you want the government to assist renewable energy sources monetarily, the money has to come from somewhere; either from new taxes or cut away from other budget items (where I'd prefer the lesser option, gov is big enough already). Thirdly, you don't provide any sources for your claims. Therefore I have some questions regarding your very vague arguments: 1) ""companies say they can make alternative biodiesel fuels for a dollar a gallon"" -> where does this number come from? What does it include (only investment, or also operating / maintenance cost, or only variable costs)? 2) ""alternative energy companies often must put operations on hold. why? because there's no demand"" -> Well, according to the EPA the demand for renewable sources is rising and will continue to rise, whereas e.g. coal is projected to decline (http://www.eia.gov...). Again, I ask you to elaborate on your claim and show me your sources for that. Your argument that there's ""no"" demand is invalid. 3) ""say a new biodiesel machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand"" -> This is just the investment. You purely ignore the O&M costs. I could continue demading more sources, but altogether your arguments can't be judged as highly valueable if you only provide things you may know or may have heard/read somewhere without any source to prove your credibility. Fourth, let me remind you that Tesla's foudner, Elon Musk, recently released the patents of Tesla cars and thereby made the technology open source (http://www.teslamotors.com...). This can be an incentive for car companies to create their own electric cars, as they don't have to do the R&D anymore (which can reach hundreds of millions of dollars). In the following costs per car can decrease as the large manufacturers can produce the cars faster and have more experience in assembling them (whereas Tesla's USP was the technology and R&D). Thereby electric cars can get cheaper, meaning more people will buy them. Following that, the demand for electricity will rise whereas the demand for fossil fuels will fall. Whether the electricity comes from renewable or non-renewable sources is another question, but according to various sources (e.g. http://www.acore.org...), wind power will increase heavily, as well as solar power, geothermal, TPD and others. Last but not least: rather than allowing the government to intervene to increase renewable energy sources, the government should, and is already, stop to prefer non-renewable sources like oil. The DoD for example already plans to lower its reliance on oil and increase renewable energy consumption (http://energy.defense.gov...)."	CON	201

Sf074f81a-Aeee7d48c	Nuclear Power	"Thanks again, Think. I. Scientific Consensus This is is an ad populum fallacy. Just because most people believe X to be true does not mean that X is actually true. At one point in time, most scientists believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, that humors were the causes of disease, that light was conveyed by a luminferous ether, and that the steady state theory explained the evolution of the universe. [18, 19] Each of these examples, which span from the 6th century to the mid-20th century, has been debunked over the years, despite enjoying temporary preeminence in the scientific community. In other words, the fact that most scientists believe X is not evidence for X, it is just evidence for the fact that most scientists believe X. Even if you don't buy that argument, Con only samples scientists from a single organization. Other groups, like Physicians for Social Responsibility, an arm of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and which I've cited already in this debate, does not support nuclear power. II. Reliability A. Nuclear power will become Less Reliable with GW Some damaging effects of climate change are inevitable. [20] Rising sea levels, changing weather patterns, and hotter temperatures will undermine the safety and functionality of nuclear plants. Heat waves can force reactors to shut down so that they don't overheat. This has already happened: ""During the 2006 heat wave, reactors in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Minnesota, as well as in France, Spain and Germany, were impacted. The European heat wave in the summer of 2003 caused cooling problems at French reactors that forced engineers to tell the government that they could no longer guarantee the safety of the country's 58 nuclear power reactors."" [5] Extreme weather events, which will likely become more frequent may also increase the risks of meltdowns; if Fukushima could be caused by a tsunami, why could a super-typhoon not duplicate that disaster somewhere else? Thus, functionality will decrease and meltdown risks will increase in the future. B. Renewables Won't need Fossil Fuel Back-ups This is true for three reasons: 1. The Law of Large Numbers. LLN is ""a probability theorem, which states that the aggregate result of a large number of uncertain processes becomes more predictable as the total number of processes increases."" Kind of like how sea turtles coordinate their egg-laying and -hatching so that so many cute baby turtles will be born at once that some are bound to survive, having many clean energy plants ensures that some will always be running so you don't need fossil fuel back-ups. If it is cloudy in Sacramento so that the solar panels can't work, it might be sunny in L.A., so their solar panels can help supply both cities. Diversification is also useful, in that even if the solar panels in Sacramento aren't able to work, the wind turbines may be able to. Consider: ""a study...found that an additional 15,000 megawatts of installed wind energy only requires an additional 18 megawatts of...reserve capacity to maintain the stability of the grid."" [21] 2. Better Batteries Solve. As battery storage capacity improves, renewables can store extra energy they produce on good days to compensate for bad days, thus ending the need for back-ups. Batteries are getting better now--recently, researchers found a way to increase battery efficiency by 20% and to decrease the costs by 25%. [22] 3. Some renewables are immune to intermittency. Geothermal and Hydropower energy draw from constant, predictable sources of energy, and are thus reliable. [23, 24] Hydro and geothermal can therefore be used as back-ups (instead of fossil fuels) to sources like solar. Hydro is also remarkably efficient--it's 50% cheaper than nuclear, can convert 90% of available energy into electricity, and some dams could conceivably produce 2,000+ MW of energy. [38, 39] III. Environment A. Nuclear Cannot be Deployed in Time To stop seriously catastrophic climate change/global warming (GW), emissions must fall drastically by 2050. Nuclear cannot be scaled up in time to reduce emission by 60-80% by 2050. Therefore, nuclear power cannot stop GW. 1. 2050 danger threshold. If the earth's temperature rises between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, 20-30% of the world's animals and plants could vanish. [25] This would essentially be a mass extinction. Increasing temperatures could cause sea levels to rise such that island nations like the Maldives or Marshall Islands or coastal cities like Venice and Bangkok could become entirely submerged; it could also cause crop yields to decrease, resulting in food shortages. [26, 27] In order to stabilize temperatures before 2050, CO2 emissions will have to fall 60-80% by that time. [28] 2. Nuclear cannot be scaled up in time to accomplish 60-80% reduction. Scientists estimate that 115 reactors would need to be constructed per year to entirely decarbonise by 2050. [29] There is no precedent which would indicate that this is feasible. In France and Sweden, which both had periods of ""rapid"" nuclear expansion, the build rate was less than 3 reactors per year. [29] Most countries could not afford to build these plants, which could cost up to $9 billion each (or ~$1.04 trillion per year), straining even wealthy countries like the US. [30] Realpolitik also tells us that not all countries will participate in such an effort, for political, financial, or security reasons. Given these challenges, it is highly improbable that nuclear is an effective solution to GW. B. Nuclear Power = Radiological and Thermal Pollution ""In addition to radiological pollution, nuclear power also contributes massive thermal pollution to both our air and water. It has been estimated that every nuclear reactor daily releases thermal energy...in excess of the heat released by the detonation of a 15 kiloton nuclear bomb blast...[N]uclear power contributes significantly to the thermal energy inside Earth's atmosphere, making it contraindicated at this time of rapid global warming."" [31] C. Renewables Solve Scientists have analzyed 139 countries' unique situations and put together individualized plans that would allow these countries to rapidly switch from fossil fuels to things like solar and wind. They argue that implementation of this plan could achieve 80% renewables by 2030. [32] Because this plan is tailored to suit each country's resources, it has a higher likelihood of successful implementation than a one-size-fits-all nuclear approach. In terms of displacing CO2, wind (with levelized costs) is 24x more effective than nuclear; other renewables, like hydro, range from 2x to 20x more effective than nuclear. [33] D. Sustainability Firstly, Con's card was not even about sustainability, where that is understood to mean being renewable/not beholden to limited resources like coal. His argument was essentially an extension of his reliable power arguments which I already responded to. Secondly, concerns over sustainability actually favor the Pro position. A ""study, based on an analysis of global deposit depletion profiles from past and present uranium mining, forecasts a global uranium mining peak of approximately 58 kilotonnes by 2015, declining gradually to 54 ktons by 2025, after which production would drop more steeply to at most 41 ktons around 2030."" The study found that even under a modest 1% per year phase-out of nuclear power worldwide, there would be supply shortages. [34] This has two impacts: (a) it turns sustainability for the Pro, and (b) it further complicates any efforts to scale up nuclear as a response to GW. V. Costs Con essentially holds off on really expanding this point, so I'll address this more thoroughly when his arguments are presented. However, it is worth noting that the image of the chart he pastes into the debate pertains only to natural gas and coal against nuclear. I am not advocating for the use of natural gas or coal; just like nuclear, I want to phase out these energy sources as well. Because I do not have to defend the use of fossil fuels, Con's evidence does not actually rebut my specific advocacy; it only addresses a strawman. You'll notice that in my argument I explained how advanced nuclear was more expensive than geothermal, wind, and hydroelectric. That same source finds that biomass energy is comparable in cost to nuclear. [16] The cost of solar is rapidly decreasing--it is down 70% since 2009 (about 10% per year). [35] The trend of cratering costs is apt to continue: ""The latest data show that the continued decrease in solar prices is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, with total installed prices dropping by 5 percent for rooftop residential systems, and 12 percent for larger utility-scale solar farms. With solar already achieving record-low prices, the cost decline observed in 2015 indicates that the coming years will likely see utility-scale solar become cost competitive with conventional forms of electricity generation."" [36] Nuclear, on the other hand, is experiencing a cost surge, jumping 2.25-4.5x from 2002 to 2008. [37] My earlier source [16] also reflects a cost increase for nuclear. IV.

S4b391e77-Ad1a2cc8f	The US should encourage more nuclear energy use over current widely used energy forms.	"Thanks to my opponent for hosting and starting this debate. I wish him the best of luck. As I will be negating the resolution today, I believe that the United States should not increase more nuclear energy over current widely used forms. To start, I would like to offer the following definitions to ensure a fair and proper debate: Nuclear Energy: The energy released by a nuclear reaction, especially by fission or fusion, regarded as a source of power. ""Current Widely Used Energy Forms"": Since my opponent has only addressed coal as a widely used energy form, I will assume that this term applies to other forms of widespread used energy such as wind, solar, hydrogen, and tidal energies. Contention 1: The increase of nuclear energy will proportionally increase the amount of nuclear waste, while other forms of energy produce little to no waste (non-radioactive). According to a July 2010 study performed by the Nuclear Energy Information Service, nuclear waste is produced in many different ways. There are wastes produced in the reactor core, wastes created as a result of radioactive contamination, and wastes produced as a byproduct of uranium mining, refining, and enrichment. A typical reactor will generate 20 to 30 tons of high-level nuclear waste annually. There is no known way to safely dispose of this waste, which remains dangerously radioactive until it naturally decays. The rate of decay of a radioactive isotope is called its half-life, the time in which half the initial amount of atoms present takes to decay. The half-life of Plutonium-239, one particularly lethal component of nuclear waste, is 24,000 years. This dangerously radioactive nuclear waste has not been dealt with, and, historically (Yucca Mountain, EM program), cannot be solved in any form, presenting large amounts of radiation that has powerfully and negatively impacted much of our vital ecosystem, such as soil and water supply and marine and human life. Other forms of energy (excluding coal), however, have been proven to leave behind virtually no waste, greatly preserving vital sectors of our ecosystem. Contention 2: The increase of nuclear energy will give rise to threatening proliferation risks, as other forms of energy cannot. Plutonium is a man-made waste product of nuclear fission, which can be used for bombs. In the year 2000, an estimated 310 tons (620,000 pounds) of weapons-usable plutonium had been produced. Less than 8 kilograms (about 18 pounds) of plutonium is enough for one Nagasaki-type bomb. Thus, in the year 2000 alone, enough plutonium was created to make more than 34,000 nuclear weapons. The technology for producing nuclear energy that is shared among nations, particularly the process that turns raw uranium into lowly-enriched uranium, can also be used to produce highly-enriched, weapons-grade uranium. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for monitoring the world's nuclear facilities and for preventing weapons proliferation, but their safeguards have serious shortcomings. Though the IAEA is promoting additional safeguards agreements to increase the effectiveness of their inspections, the agency acknowledges that, due to measurement uncertainties, it cannot detect all possible diversions of nuclear material. My conclusion will be another sort of contention, but it didn't nominally fit as a contention. Nuclear energy, as my opponent stated, does provide jobs & revenue. However, alternative energy provides the same, if not greater, economic stimulus without the risks of proliferation and hazardous nuclear waste that are brought on by nuclear energy. According to a 2007 study performed by the American Energy Society, in 2006, alternative energy development industries/efforts generated 8.5 million new jobs and grossed nearly $1.22 trillion dollars overall. Nuclear energy may seem like the best way to go, but it is merely a wolf in sheep's clothing. The furthering of nuclear energy usage would be a very detrimental choice. Coal is not, as my opponent has insinuated,the only choice to contemplate other than nuclear energy. Alternative energy use will complete all of the benefits my opponent mentioned of nuclear energy without posing any risk to our ecosystem, human life, or proliferation-resultant attacks. If someone is presented with an obtainable reward, but given the choice to either walk to recieve it with no threats, or to take risks of any sort to recieve the reward, the choice would and should be obvious. For all of the aforementioned reasons in this debate, I strongly urge a vote for CON. Thanks."	CON	204
Sdd09931a-Acba51811	Resolved: The United States should Significantly Increase its Use of Nuclear Energy	My opponent claims I did not address the issue of carbon emissions released in the aquisition, maintenance, and post-production stages of producing nuclear energy. I in fact have addressed this issue providing stats that indicate the release of those emissions is through the use of fossil fuel burning vehicles in mining, transport, and construction. I pointed out this part of the process is equal throughout the field of energy production. I also pointed out that nuclear was just one piece of the puzzle to cleaner energy and energy independence. By using clean energy like nuclear, we can free up natural gas reserves for use in these vehicles. THEN there will be little to no carbon emissions at any step in the production of nuclear energy. Until then, it is a reality with ANY type of energy production, including wind and solar. I addressed the Belarus issue by stating the US is not Belarus. Our methods of production, disposal, security, research- we are far superior on all fronts to all developed nations, let alone Belarus. In fact, the incident in Chernobyl occured in 1986, and scathing reviews have been written about the various inadequacies at the plant, including poorly trained personnel. My opponent claims we shouldn't use the US as an example, but at 104, we have almost double the amount of nuclear power plants in France and Japan (59 and 55 respectively). Only two major accidents in the history of civil nuclear power have ever occured, and the Three Mile Island icident was contained. Only TWO major accidents in over 12,700 cumulative years of use in 32 different countries. There is no argument against the fact that nuclear power is potentially hazardous, but safer methods are being developed, and even without those methods there have been only two major accidents in history. Only one can be pointed to having a major affect on the population, and that is because there were no fire prevention/containment methods in place at the poorly built, poorly managed facility at Chernobyl. If nuclear energy production in the US is raised by 20% of the total- as my opponent points out is the maximum possible with current manufacturing constraints to do so by 2050- and solar and wind were ramped up to represent 39% of total energy production, that would mean that 79% of US energy production would be clean by then. That would lead to a drop of 79% annual carbon emissions. I pointed this out in my last argument... My opponent argues that he doesn't see how it is an important piece of the pie. Well, rather than citing 1,000 sources that say it is a significant piece of the pie for the path to energy independence and clean energy I will ask readers to do a simple google search, and read the thousands of comments from educated sources. There are very few energy experts claiming nuclear shouldn't be a significant part, but even most of the detractors admit it should be. My opponent's argument on efficiency makes no sense. Efficient: (1): effective operation as measured by a comparison of production with cost (as in energy, time, and money) (2): the ratio of the useful energy delivered by a dynamic system to the energy supplied to it. An increase in production of nuclear energy would, in fact, result in an increase in it's share of total energy production in the US. His argument that demand increases is true for ANY type of energy, and therefore moot. His argument contradicts logistical reality and needs. If nuclear energy falls below 20% of total energy we are working backwards. We will be working LESS toward the goal of clean and independent energy, as even by his own estimates by 2050 solar and wind will go up to 39% of total energy. If nuclear is not ramped up, and demand goes up at a rate that would eliminate nuclear's 20% share, then any clean alternative would be meaningless because we would have to support the need with no-so-clean sources like coal and natural gas. That is counterproductive to the goal of cutting carbon emissions. My opponent opposes energy because methods for storage have not been put into place, and efficient recycling hasn't been developed. I am arguing that they MUST be developed, and this will result in a significant increase in nuclear energy production. The beautiful thing about science is that when something is not available, but needs to be, the research and development of the process alone creates jobs. The implementation creates more jobs, and the use of these methods will create even more. Research and development is already in place, and not too far off from success. My opponent seems to have given up in this debate. He has not offered any new arguments to my rebuttals, and has placed redundant arguments. Conventional logic is the belief that the US should significantly increase it's use of nuclear energy. http://www.world-nuclear.org... , http://www.euronuclear.org..., http://www.nei.org..., http://www.ne.doe.gov..., http://www.epa.gov...

S712ab9ff-A443312b4	The United States should invest in nuclear power.	"Alternative energy is something that the United States desperately needs to look into but nuclear power should not be one of the areas. It is not cost effective. It is dangerous and is subject to terrorist attacks. Nuclear power was formerly known as ""to cheap to meter."" It now needs to be renamed ""to expensive to produce."" France invested in nuclear power in 2007, the main investor is now millions of dollars in debt. There are more effective alternative energies to invest in such as wind or solar. America has invested in nuclear power before and it just hasn't worked out. The fact that a repeat of the three mile island disaster is still prevalent should be a reason in itself on why we should not be investing. Like most energies, waste will be produced. To this day storage containers for this potentially deadly nuclear waste has not been developed. Many states have ended all research of nuclear power. It has turned into a ""not in my backyard"" argument. America wants to be a secure country. Investing in nuclear power only increases the chances of it becoming insecure. Of the 61 nuclear sites in the United States over half were deemed vulnerable of a terrorist attack. Some shocking news is that Al Qaeda's original 9/11 plan was to fly planes into nuclear power plants, as if the executed attack wasn't deadly enough. When making a decision on where the United States should invest it's time and money, I sincerely hope nuclear power is not considered."	CON	206

Sf59a1cd-A7def630e	Beginner's Tournament, Nuclear Power Plants	My respected opponent, thank you for continuing this debate Rebuttal Renewables: It is true that power is not generated if there no sun or wind, but let's be real here. No one is going to die in a hospital when it rains or is calm because of no solar/wind power being generated at that moment. Both technologies have energy storage capacity. Again, I need not provide alternative sources for energy, only to prove nuclear is costly, and dangerous. Looking at the article you cited #7, the author calculates death rates from start to finish of all types of energy sources; i.e. mining, construction, installation and particulate dispersion. Yes, coal has the highest death rates. Death rates for wind and solar power were attributed to installation and maintenance; falling off roof tops and wind towers. I find that lack of construction safety is not a direct factor to be considered, especially in light of long term affects of a radiation cloud contaminating everything in its path for decades. Chernobyl 1,004 square miles of inhabitable land that will remain so between 180 to 320 years [3], Fukushima 3,500 square miles of contamination [2]. Furthermore, there are no mining deaths associated with solar or wind. Also, the article states that coal emissions can be reduced to 99.5% efficiency with electrostatic precipitators if plant retrofits were done. China has 650 GWe and US 315 GWe coal fired output. It would cost 20 billion and 16 billion respectively for ALL these countries plants. In light of cost for a single 1 GW Nuclear power being $17 billion, where would you put your money? The 0.04 figure you ascribe for nuclear power deaths is very misleading due to IAEA reporting of deaths are direct causal, i.e. calculated only during and shortly after a nuclear disaster, as well as data collected only in highly contaminated zones, excluding lesser contaminated areas. They do not report or add the latent death tolls accrued over the long term, decades [4, 5]. Rebuttal Safe & Stable: To repeat when a nuclear power plant accident does occur it very much does pollute the surrounding area for many decades. On top of the uninhabitable zone, the Chernobyl disaster cast its radioactive plumage over Eastern Europe, Finland and Sweden [6]. Upon review of your citation #8 [7] regarding radioactive fly ash from coal, this contamination is limited to one half mile to a mile of a coal stacks along with disposal sites, a relatively contained area in comparison to nuclear accident fallout. There is a serious issue on what to do with Fukushima’s decommissioning and what to do with the radioactive wastes; they still have not found the melted nuclear cores. There are no plans to remove the radioactive fuel until 2020 because the technology to do it safely does not yet exist. There seems to be a lot of placing carts before horses when it comes to Nuclear Power. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Prime Minister Noda both were against nuclear power expansion, with Noda planning to phase out nuclear power within 20 years [8]. Rebuttal 1. Cost: Using again your citation #1 [9], under Key Observations “Government incentives can change the relative costs of the generating technologies. For example, federal loan guarantees can turn nuclear power from a high cost technology to a relatively low cost option.” Please note can change and high cost technology. On p.17 “the costs of building a new nuclear plant in the United States will apparently be very high” and goes on to state later not only loan guarantees but, tax credits are needed. Continuing “If the plant is expensive, adding the return into rates as a single big adjustment can inflict “rate shock” on customers.” Also on p.77 “ Because it was not possible to extract the escalation costs from the project estimates, as a rough correction the financial model assumed no cost escalation to avoid a double count.” Cost overruns are persistent [10] and not included in this report. Then, let’s factor in those additional subsidies that go out every year, remember that 3.3 billion mentioned last round? Rebuttal 2. Dangers: I have addressed the issue of disparity in reported death tolls. And yes, this type of reactor has been decommissioned, but what happened just in 2011 with Fukushima, a newer technology. Another such accident is pending due to sea level rise and storm surges with nuclear plants located near water for cooling purposes [11, 12] 2011 & 2015 data. Then there is the ever-present issue of nuclear waste storage [13]. Your citation #1 also states that no permanent solution for wastes has been determined. As well as now there are additional risks associated with now non-nuclear countries obtaining this technology; North Korea and Iran for example [14]. If a country can build a power plant they can also build a bomb. 16000 reactor-years of safety is brought to insignificance when just one accident occurs. Sweden, Austria, Germany, Denmark Greece Italy and a dozen additional countries are phasing out nuclear power as a result of past nuclear accidents. Rebuttal 3 Clean: See rebuttal renewables & safe and stable In summary: Without heavy government subsidies, production tax credits and loan guarantees from a government, nuclear power is far too costly against other power generating options. The lack of end result on what to do with radioactive wastes is and outstanding issue of concern. Despite the few number of accidents that have occurred, deaths and land contamination over long term has been devastating, more so than other energy sources. The issue of safety and fear of future accidents has resulted in more than a dozen countries choosing to discontinue their nuclear power programs. Proliferation of nuclear power extends to the issue of nuclear aggression. Citations in comments	CON	208
Se6216237-A5785a1ab	Resolved: Allowing deep water offshore oil drilling is in the best interest of the United States.	Thank you for a great debate Pro, I believe it was very productive. To address your claim about the cost: it is true that solar energy is relatively expensive in comparison to oil and coal, at about $0.38 per kilowatt hour. However, as previously stated, while oil and gas technologies tend to get more expensive as time goes on, solar technology gets cheaper and cheaper as it becomes more and more mass produced. Additionally, the government plans to initiate tax incentives to benefit solar industry, which will help expedite the falling costs (http://greenecon.net...). Wind power is similar in that the startup costs are high, but much like any other long-term investment, both of these technologies pay for themselves and end up saving the investor money over the 20-30 year life of the unit. This is what people with Pro's mentality never seem to be able to grasp. Oil is a short-term investment that will cost us in the long run for environmental and economic reasons, while alternative energy has long-term benefits that will pay off in both environmental and economic benefits in the years to come. Saving the quick buck by continuing off-shore drilling is no way to build a sustainable nation, and sustainability is certainly in the best interest of the United States. The rest of my opponent's final round is essentially a repost of his first round, which I have already negated. I feel no need to do so again. I will therefore end this debate with an appeal to logic and reason. In summary, we have a choice. As world population continues to rise, we can either continue down a road that will inevitably lead to a dead-end when we run out of oil while we do severe damage to the environment in the meantime and miss out on great economic opportunities, or we can immediately shift our focus to alternative energy, which has a greater economic benefit, provides vastly more than enough energy for the entire planet, and is much less harmful to the environment. It is a choice that should be obvious - a choice that is not only in the best interest of the United States, but is in the best interest of the world at large.	CON	209

Sf1a21db5-A82678a78	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"Overview, line by line, and voting issues: My opponent has offered a lot of things within this debate that COULD do harm, but NO WHERE has he offered a direct disadvantage of passing the plan. He has said that we will have to boil a lot of water… but where is the disadvantage in that. He has yet to say how these ""harms"" will outweigh ANY of my advantages let alone have they been PROVEN to hurt anyone. The amount of money we presently spend in the status quo should SLIGHTLY be shifted to the energy of the future… fusion energy. --> So my opponent says that I've called his arguments irrelevant. Well… 1) The evidence does not specifically say anything about fusion energy. 2) There are no harms PROVEN with boiling this water. 3) Even if there were harms, they would NOT outweigh the advantages already PROVEN. --> I don't know the exact date of when fusion energy will be achieved, but I DO know that fusion energy will be EXTREMELY for longed if the plan is not passed. Fusion energy will be achieved, the question isn't when but how can we make it come sooner… the answer? Advocating this plan will make fusion energy (the energy of the future) come MUCH sooner. The reason that fusion energy hasn't come yet is because of people like negative who expect a new form of energy tomorrow. But in reality, it will take a consistent amount of funding until this new form of energy is reached. To all people judging this round, I ask you to be patient and pass this plan, if you do, the chance of fusion energy being here as soon as possible is increased. --> AGAIN… It is not Affirmatives job to show the environmental harms of his OWN PLAN… I guess since I haven't shown any environmental harms then there aren't any. The only harms argued in this debate are that we have to boil a lot of water. 1) That's not a bad thing. 2) The harms from fossil fuels are MUCH greater. --> The whole agendas thing must be dropped from this round. He himself has said that he doesn't know what these agendas are AND (like the other insignificant ""harms"") are not proven to do ANYTHING bad AND if those bad things (that don't exist) outweigh the advantages in my original case. --> As proven in my previous speech, the energy exchange is 50 megawatts put in, 5,000 megawatts received (from fusion energy). Therefore the Deuterium argument must be dropped. He says that we need to put in energy to get energy… BUT when you get 500 megawatts for every 1 megawatt you put in, it is WORTH it. Multiply that many times and soon the energy crisis is over! Even the CHANCE of this is enough reason to pass the plan. (he said), ""proving that bad things can come of this.""--> He says that bad things CAN come from this but has yet to say WHAT these bad things are. (he said), ""if we somehow achieved fusion, and that it is unlikely that we will""--> He never gave any evidence that fusion energy can not be found. I gave evidence that it is likely to come relatively soon, you simply have to be patient AND pass the plan in order to offer the appropriate funding. LEGISLATIVE INTENT EXTENSION: Cap on the emergency fund is all controlled by the government and is issued by the government (post-plan). The point of the emergency fund is if there is need for more funding if what is originally issued becomes not enough. --> Negative has brought up (in a small manner) the amount of money that this will cost. However, if you look to the amount of money that we spend on fossil fuel is SLIGHTLY transferred to fusion energy; it is not that much money. Billions upon billions of dollars is spent on fossil fuels, therefore, investing in another form of energy that will be cheaper in the end could HARDLY be ""too expensive."" (he said) ""Do the large amounts of risks outweigh the slim chance of success, and even slimmer chance that fusion will live up to what it claims to be?""--> 1) Again, it is not a matter of ""IF"" but ""WHEN"" solvency will be reached. Fusion energy has not been reached yet because the incentive is not high enough yet, therefore, I urge that this alternative energy incentive is substantially increased and therefore we make the ""WHEN"" sooner. It has been said that two heads are better than one… therefore the more we put into the research of fusion energy, the better we are. 1)--> Instead of providing evidence that you pressed for I turned it against you. You pressed me to provide evidence that there were no harms but it was you job to provide the harms and my job to prove that they are not that bad AND/OR they don't outweigh the advantages. 2)--> My new evidence was 1) reserved, and, 2) expansions and/or responses on previous arguments VOTERS: In the end of this debate, I want judges to ask themselves, ""Why not?"" My opponent has said that we will have to boil a lot of water and that we might have to spend some money but has yet to show how this will ""harm"" society. One thing is for certain, we are in an energy crisis. Billions of dollars are being spent on fossil fuels and it is ridiculous. Imagine a world where you never have to fill your car with any form of energy… A world that you get all of your energy in each of your everyday items and only have to pay pennies for all of it. ""The power of the sun in the palm of my hand"" is what we are trying to achieve and the BEST way to achieve it is by passing my plan."	PRO	211

S78068d61-A5fa0174b	Nuclear power should be banned	"I thank my opponent for his counter-argument. Waste Let's take a look at the total amount of byproducts produced by various forms of generating energy in the USA: Wind - nothing Solar - nothing Tidal - nothing Geothermal - nothing Hydroelectric - nothing Nuclear - 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste So the idea that nuclear emits less toxic byproducts than other industries is a complete lie. Now, is it safe to produce 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste per year? You can have all the regulation in the world and it still wouldn't be safe! He claims that the huge metal water-vaults (aka toxic swimming pools) are safe, and yet I've already provided a scientific study showing that they're not. Finally he says that there is a financial incentive for the companies to keep them safe. I agree, but I contend that they cannot be kept safe. The companies are going for short-term profit over long-term environmental protection. I agree that coal isn't a good alternative, but how about not comparing nuclear to other crappy forms of energy, and instead comparing it to good energy? If the motion was for abolishing coal-based power plants then I'd be all for it, but right now let's deal with the topic at hand. Then he says nuclear byproducts are less toxic than solar ones. First, those aren't byproducts of electricity generation, they're construction byproducts. Second, the byproducts we're talking about are things like lead and mercury. They're dangerous if handled frequently, but completely safe inside a cell (like how mercury is safe in thermometers or lead in lead-acid batteries), particulary a cell that isn't handled frequently. If a solar panel ever leaks, it can be simply and safely recycled, unlike radioactive material. It is far safer for mercury to be inside a solar cell than for it to be out there in the environment. Same thing applies to lead. The differences to nuclear are that: 1) the byproducts are not byproducts because they are part of the cell, not buried or drowned, and 2) there is a much smaller quantity of them than 12.3 million kilograms, and 3) enriched, spent uranium isn't a naturally-occuring thing we are removing from the environment, rather we are adding it. That's why nuclear is worse. Finally he talks about China importing the solar cells. Oh no, you're boosting your exports! I doubt you'll find an economist who says that more money for American businesses is bad for the American economy. Weaponization Let's take a step back. What is a nuclear weapon? Dictionary.com defines it as ""an explosive device whose destructive potential derives from the release of energy that accompanies the splitting or combining of atomic nuclei."" Now what is a nuclear reactor? Dictionary.com gives the very unhelpful answer of ""a reactor"", but thefreedictionary.com defines it as ""a device in which a nuclear reaction is maintained and controlled for the production of nuclear energy"". So, the differences are that one is explosive and destructive, and the other is maintained and controlled. Other than that, the two are exactly the same. A reactor is a maintained and controlled bomb. As to required enrichment, it is true that one requires a different critical mass for a nuclear chain reaction compared with just a slow nuclear reaction, but BOTH are harmful to people and the environment. Both solutions are therefore bad. Also, I think the US would be much safer if they were peaceful and stayed out of everybody's way too, but I digress. The point is that nuclear technology is NOT required for a strong national defense - if anything, it just gives foreign countries and terrorists another thing to attack. Jobs Remember how I said Germany is getting rid of their power plants? At a time when unemployment in many places, such as almost every single nuclear nation, is at a record high, guess who are enjoying their lowest unemployment rate in two decades? That's right - Germany - with the interviewed economist even noting that ""all available indicators still point to a further improvement of the German labour market"" [3]. So why is my opponent so wrong? Firstly he says that solar could only create 10,000 jobs total. If you look at his source, however, he has missed a zero at the end of that number, so it should read 100,000 jobs - and that's not the ""total"" jobs, that's just the initial ones, for as it says ""jobs would only go up over a longer period"". He then states that 11% of wind energy jobs are in construction, and 5% are in maintenance. If you look at his source, it doesn't state these percentages anywhere, so he's clearly just making stuff up. I agree that the nuclear industry employs 50,000 people - but when solar energy ALONE, ignoring all the other forms of green energy, will generate 100,000 jobs right from day one if expanded, you bet jobs would boom. Just like they boomed in New Zealand after we banned it, and in Germany after they banned it. Cost My opponent has simply mistaken megawatts for kilowatts. 1 kilowatt = 0.001 megawatts. Bearing this in mind, my source actually estimates the hourly cost of nuclear even cheaper than many of con's sources. And I agree that nuclear is cheaper than fossil fuels. However, green energy remains the cheapest. His source asserting that nuclear energy is the cheapest did not take into account any green energy production, only fossil fuel. Safety A meltdown is not the only way nuclear energy can break down, so meltdown regulation is a bit of a waste of time. Our favorite lobby group, world nuclear, tells us they try hard to minimise accidents, but the fact is we're still facing a major accident every 8 years or so, despite all these ""newer"" designs (by the way, the idea that nuclear is too modern to break down predates Chernobyl by a few decades, and was in that Economist article I talked about last round). Then he cites another lobby-group article saying the accidents are easily controlled, using the example of three-mile island. That's where 40,000 gallons of radioactive waste water was dumped into a river, 140,000 people were evacuated, and $1 billion was spent on the cleanup [1]. That's far from being ""easily contained"" - the accident wasn't contained at all! That's the worst accident in the US involving nuclear power plants. The worst involving solar power? Nobody cares what that is, because when solar power fails, there is zero health risk. Same for all the other green energy solutions by the way. And given how long the list of nuclear power plant accidents is [2] (and that's excluding incidents and accidents at the Springfield power plant), I doubt that any level of training will help the situation. Green Again, I don't care what emits more CO2. Don't confuse environmentalism with climate change (though my opponent is wrong about the CO2 thing - solar has zero running emmissions, only construction emmissions from mining minerals used in solar cells, but nuclear power plant construction takes longer and emits more). I also don't care about sustainability, which my opponent tries to talk about twice. A sustainable nuclear power plant is a bad thing, because all that while it will be killing you and your descendants, among other harmful effects. On my part, I do worry about that. I worry about it a lot. We don't need to poison ourselves with more radiation. There are other, cheaper, and most importantly, cleaner alternatives available. My opponent continues to ignore this. We don't need nuclear power to save the planet. We don't want nuclear power to pollute us. My opponent's arguments are wrong, his sources are either lobbiests or misquoted, and he has failed to respond to my case. The motion stands.

Se8b51f74-A9244fa5c	Alternative Energy used by 2010	Hello bears: Let me get this straight first, I support alternate fuels, but having them by 2010 is impossible. For my argument, I'm going to focus on the car business. Having alternate fuels would be great, but 2010 is too soon. 1) Congress would agree with me here that 2010 is too soon, because their new Cafe Laws will require cars to have a minimum of 35 mpg' s by 2020(I do not support this law). This is a whole 10 years after than you propose. 2) Where can we fuel up. If we were to grow to full time alternate fuels in 2-3 years there would be no fuel to fill up. factory's and scientist need to find ways to these fuels at high demand. Another thing is we would need gas stations to fill up. It would take at least 5 years to get the right number of gas stations to fuel our demand. I know that General Motors is trying to get more E85 stations, but they are having a lot of trouble. It has been 2 or so years, and the only places that they are common are in Minnesota and Wisconsin (there are not that common, but there are more in those states than any other state). Lastly, how would we get the fuel to the stations. It would take billions of dollars ant multiple years to get a truck fleet to fit our demand for the fuels. Three years isn't enough time. It won't be till 2030 before alternative fuels are more common than gas.	CON	220
S1ff2ec96-A78a16d1c	The united states federal government should offer tax incentives for offshore wind turbines	"SOLVENCY A.) NO SHIPS FOR CONSTRUCTION According to Robet B. Hopkins and Duane Morris LLP w/ with a concentration on transportation, products liability and commercial litigation, there are NO ships available to install wind farms as most of the ships in the SQ are tied up in Asia (especially China, the leading producer of Wind Energy) and Europe. This means that the plan is impossible and cannot actually happen, thus it shouldn’t be voted on. (link below) Inherency A.) Price of the energy on the consumer Institute for Energy Research, 11-6-2013, ""N.J. Offshore Wind Project Reveals True Cost to Taxpayer,"" IER, http://instituteforenergyresearch.org... As noted previously by the Institute for Energy Research (IER), offshore wind is a terrible investment economically. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), offshore wind is 2.6 times more expensive than onshore wind power and is 3.4 times more expensive than power produced by a combined cycle natural gas plant. On a kilowatt hour basis, offshore wind power is estimated to cost 22.15 cents per kilowatt hour, while onshore wind is 8.66 cents per kilowatt hour, and natural gas combined cycle is only 6.56 per kilowatt hour. The price for coal is about 10 cents per Kilowatt hour thus doing the plan will raise prices of electricity more than 2 fold. Not only thins but you, the judge will have to pay for the subsidy with YOUR tax money meaning that your wallet will be double hit by this plan. Pro said that wind energy is: “a rapidly growing industry that needs the US federal government support in order to expand.” How exactly does that work? if you are rapidly growing industry you are successful if you require subsidies you are failing and thus require a crutch. Wind is a failing industry that is usurping money from the US economy which could be better used in education, infrastructure or hell, even onshore wind which is much cheaper and more reliable. Just look at how weak wind energy really is without the Production Tax Credit to support and subsidize it and then tell me how such an industry can truley be profitable on its own two feet: Response:Global Warming Advantage A.) Creation of wind turbines causes massive pollution and leads to Radioactive waste in china IER, 10-23-2013, ""Big Wind’s Dirty Little Secret: Toxic Lakes and Radioactive Waste,"" http://instituteforenergyresearch.org... ""A typical wind turbine contains more than 8,000 different components, many of which are made from steel, cast iron, and concrete. One such component are magnets made from neodymium and dysprosium, rare earth minerals mined almost exclusively in China, which controls 95 percent of the world’s supply of rare earth minerals"" It is these magnets which result in huge amounts of radioactive waste being produced in china, here is testimony from Simon Pary from the Daily Mail who went to see these magnet factories in China first hand: ""As more factories sprang up, the banks grew higher, the lake grew larger and the stench and fumes grew more overwhelming. 'It turned into a mountain that towered over us,’ says Mr Su. ‘Anything we planted just withered, then our animals started to sicken and die.’ People too began to suffer. Dalahai villagers say their teeth began to fall out, their hair turned white at unusually young ages, and they suffered from severe skin and respiratory diseases. Children were born with soft bones and cancer rates rocketed. Official studies carried out five years ago in Dalahai village confirmed there were unusually high rates of cancer along with high rates of osteoporosis and skin and respiratory diseases. The lake’s radiation levels are ten times higher than in the surrounding countryside, the studies found."" ""According to the Bulletin of Atomic Sciences, a 2 megawatt (MW) wind turbine contains about 800 pounds of neodymium and 130 pounds of dysprosium. The MIT study cited above estimates that a 2 MW wind turbine contains about 752 pounds of rare earth minerals. To quantify this in terms of environmental damages, consider that mining one ton of rare earth minerals produces about one ton of radioactive waste, according to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. In 2012, the U.S. added a record 13,131 MW of wind generating capacity. That means that between 4.9 million pounds (using MIT’s estimate) and 6.1 million pounds (using the Bulletin of Atomic Science’s estimate) of rare earths were used in wind turbines installed in 2012. It also means that between 4.9 million and 6.1 million pounds of radioactive waste were created to make these wind turbines. For perspective, America’s nuclear industry produces between 4.4 million and 5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel each year. That means the U.S. wind industry may well have created more radioactive waste last year than our entire nuclear industry produced in spent fuel."" Furthermore... ""Not only do rare earths create radioactive waste residue, but according to the Chinese Society for Rare Earths, one ton of calcined rare earth ore generates 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters (339,021 to 423,776 cubic feet) of waste gas containing dust concentrate, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid, [and] approximately 75 cubic meters (2,649 cubic feet) of acidic wastewater.” These facts alone represent a case take-out and shows that wind turbine creation will have no better effects on the environment then other methods of energy production B.) Methane makes warming impossible to stop Bobby Magill, 2014, ""Arctic Methane Emissions 'Certain to Trigger Warming',"" No Publication, http://www.climatecentral.org... ""As climate change melts Arctic permafrost and releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere, it is creating a feedback loop that is ""certain to trigger additional warming,"" according to the lead scientist of a new study investigating Arctic methane emissions. The study released this week examined 71 wetlands across the globe and found that melting permafrost is creating wetlands known as fens, which are unexpectedly emitting large quantities of methane.

For example, in the UK, where there are several hundred turbines, about one bird is killed per turbine per year; 10 million per year are killed by cars alone.[3] In the United States, turbines kill 70,000 birds per year, compared to 57 million killed by cars and 97.5 million killed by collisions with plate glass.

Sb3cf5511-Abbfaa49a	Resolved: On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks.	"Framework I agreed with my opponent's framework that the burden of Pro is to prove that the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks. That is, after all, what the resolution states. But the main phrase that should help voters frame the debate is ""on balance,"" where the concept of nuclear power as a whole must be taken into account. I went into great detail in the previous round explaining why Chernobyl and Three Mile Island are not representative of nuclear power today. There is a possibility (a risk) of my computer exploding in my face. Such a risk is very impactful, but it only outweighs the benefits of computer ownership (increased productivity, etc.) if it is likely to occur. If the possibility of harm is extremely small, as is the likelihood of a nuclear meltdown, and the probability of benefits are almost certain (economic growth, energy security, etc.), then the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks, and Pro has upheld the affirmative burden of proof. Carbon Emissions I would like to point out to voters that Con's many arguments to the Pro case do not necessarily have much substance behind them. In many cases, Con's quotations are simply reiterations of his claim without defending the reasoning behind the claim. In a couple cases, Con's citations have nothing to do with the topic at hand. I'll point these out along the way. Con then claims nuclear power actually results in more carbon emissions. This is really interesting, because Independent Online explains: ""Over the full life cycle - from mining of the uranium, iron ore and other minerals, manufacture of the components and construction of the power station, operation and maintenance of the power station through to decommissioning of the station and the management and disposal of waste - nuclear power emits less than 11 grams of carbon equivalent per kilowatt hour. "" [(10) http://www.iol.co.za...] The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates carbon output as even lower: ""For example, during its whole life cycle, nuclear power releases three to six grams of carbon per kiloWatthour (GC kWh) of electricity produced"" [9]. Clearly, we have conflicting evidence. Here's why Pro is still prefered: Unlike solar and wind power, nuclear energy is not susceptable to weather fluctuations. For example, wind farms must keep conventional power generators running at all times, making wind extremely unprofitable [(11)http://online.wsj.com...]. Nuclear energy is able to thrive in limited spaces and operate independently from global weather patterns. So even with both sides' carbon emissions evidence dropped, nuclear power is still more efficient than wind and solar. Is nuclear power alone enough to mitigate total carbon output? No, and I never claimed it was. It is, however, the best and most sustainable among current energy sources. Con then claims that nuclear energy is not renewable, because uranium exists only in finite quantities. While the earth's supply of uranium, if used and discarded, will only last for about 50-60 years, Con ignores my evidence explaining that used uranium (95% in fact) is often recycled over and over again to meet future needs [6]. Nuclear energy is indeed renewable. Terrorism When it comes to energy security, one must look to the long term effects of enacting a policy. Con's only responses to the fact that nuclear energy will reduce oil dependence is citing costruction times and negative economic impacts, all of which I refuted in the previous round. When looking long term, the fact that a nuclear reactor takes 5 years to build is paltry compared with the resulting economic output and productivity. Even construction times are beginning to decrease, with pre-assembled parts increasing in use in recent years [(12) http://www.technologyreview.com...]. Furthermore, just as transportation transitioned coal power to petroleum power in the 20th century, current modes of transportation will likewise adapt to nuclear power as the technology expands [(13) http://www.ncpa.org...]. This should alleviate any of Con's concerns that nuclear power would not reduce oil dependence. My opponent then claims that if the U.S. attempts energy independence, that we will follow the fates of Third World Countries that attempted import-substitution economic policies. Understand that the concept of ""import substitution"" is that of replacing imports with domestic products, and my opponent's comparison of the United Statse to Latin American nations is ridiculous. The reason this policy did not work in these nations is that governments, by implementing elaborate command economies, tried to force their destitute citizens to consume products they couldn't afford. Market economies with greater citizen purchasing power, such as Brazil and Chile, have experienced enormous success by turning to domestic energy sources [(14) Blouet, Olwyn; Olwyn Blouet and Brian W. Blouet (2002). Latin America and the Caribbean: A Systematic and Regional Survey. New York: John Wiley.]. The U.S. will be wise to follow this model. Con then tries to turn my terrorism point, claiming that ceasing oil imports from the Middle East will cause those nations not to like us, and will therefore cause them to increase terrorist support. There are two problems with this assertion. First, one of the main reasons there is jihadist resentment against the United States in the first place is because our oil ties with Middle Eastern governments, namely Saudi Arabia [(15) http://www.brookings.edu...]. The United States is literally seen as an imperialist aggressor hell-bent on exploiting Middle Eastern resources. Secondly, the concept of peak oil ensures that oil prices won't decrease in the long term, and the fact that demand for oil in India in China is increasing at a faster rate than demand in the United States ensures that prices will remain high in the short term [(16) http://www.nytimes.com...]. To conclude this point, my opponent continues to operate under ""what-if"" scenarios to substantiate his points. Con claims that Middle Eastern nations might turn hostile if the United States were to phase out oil dependence, but never cites any intent by these governments. The likelihood of a risk becoming reality must be given more weight than mere theoretical possibility. Conclusion This is essentially what this debate comes down to: possibility versus probability. Con tries to extend the fears of the past to today's very different nuclear climate. Meltdowns, terrorist attacks and health crises are possibilities with an extremely slim chance of actually taking place. On the other hand, the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear energy are well documented and supported by reality. Don't let the scare tactics fool you. The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	223
Se2550a31-A9fb5490	Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs	"My opponent did not present direct responses to my points. His first argument seem to be that: 1) It does not facilitate public policy debate, and that it avoids real issues. I answer with a simple, so what? This may sound harsh but the risks of extinction which have gone un-responded too outweigh the need for honesty, which is where I will deal with my opponent's should analysis. He claims should implies a moral issue and thus we debate fairness or ""deontological"" issues. However I see no reason why utilitarian values are not just as moral. Utilitarianism, the ends based system of measuring morality, is far superior then this general, ""people should ACT according to some abstract moral standard"", because: 1) there are no 'universal moral truths.' Such truths are difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. On the other hand, the benefits and disadvantages of actions are much more easily calculated. Thus, rather than relying on amorphous, vague moral truths to guide action we should look to more concrete ways of determining the ethics of a particular act to allow us to actually weigh actions and understand what impacts could be in the first place. 2) What do we do when absolute moral principles in deontology conflict? For example if we say retributive justice is an absolute moral principle, then we cannot do a plea bargain as then the one receiving the bargain would not be getting their full due of punishment. However what if that plea bargain could result in 10 more criminals getting their due of punishment? So we must look to and ends based system of morality and in this system I have showed in my counter plan that we risk extinction without global warming. Colder temperatures support war and in a nuclear world we cannot risk this. And as I showed with bearden any nuclear war is by necessity unlimited in scope. Extinction or even the probability thereof outweighs all else as it ends all life forever, it takes away all the future lives also. No matter the probability it outweighs all else as a fraction of infinity is still infinity. My opponents second point was that alternative energy sources are sought to reduce dependence on foreign oil and that it is inevitable that fossil fuels will run out. I would say this is simply not true, lets be honest here, the main support or at least one of the main supports for alternatives is global warming. Causing people to be afraid of alternatives will make us use fossil fuels here especially at 3545467.5 times at much. And on the point that fossil fuels will run out eventually anyway I would say that 1)If we can use enough, and if we use enough that it's actually gone, we would of put enough out to warm the planet more. This means you should compare which planet will be warmer and since mine would be because of the outpouring of fossil fuels there is: A) Reduced chance of nuclear war and extinction B) Reduced chance of famine, we need more c02 in the air not to have a famine in grains. A famine would cause massive harms to human life and also decimate our chances of stopping poverty a leading killer in the world. My opponent last point-like thing about how, If there were no global warming and no foreign dependence on oil, we would still be concerned with obtaining energy at the lowest cost and with minimizing pollution, is irrelevant. At the very least making alternatives appear more expensive will cause MORE fossil fuel output then there is on his side and thus maximizing global warming. Resolution, consider yourself negated."

S66699e25-Aef0db834	Nuclear power presents the only viable option for reducing CO2 output	Rounds: One opening statement each, two rebuttals and then one open to floor/closing. Nuclear power is not only a safe and reliable source of power but also when considered the most cost effective source of electricity currently available. Even taking into consideration all nuclear incidents globally, this includes mining, fuel purification, plant operation, waste disposal, construction and material transport the number of life years lost as a result is considerably less than those lost solely in the mining of coal. The effects of radiation are widely misunderstood and the limits set by the international community are extremely cautious compared to studies on actual tolerable levels of radiation. This combined with the media outlook on the results of nuclear accidents has given a highly distorted view of the danger posed by nuclear power generation. Nuclear power plants as a result of the way they operate are an inherently stable and reliable source of energy particularly when plants operate more than one reactor and have the capacity to shift load from one reactor to another during routine maintenance. The long and predictable lifespan of reactor designs also gives a constant source of unvarying power output for extended periods of time. The typical lifespan of a nuclear reactor is 70 years this is almost double that of a coal fired power plant. When compared to other forms of electrical generation the overall lifetime cost per per kW is one of the lowest if not the lowest, this however does not take into account the potential global economic costs of global warming beyond 450ppm CO2. If the potential cost of the effects of global climate change are factored into the costing then nuclear is easily the best option. Not only this but if you consider the heavy impact of concrete production on the release of greenhouse gasses then it is in fact, in terms of construction, greener to build a nuclear power plant than to build the equivalent number of wind turbines. This is down to the fact that each and every wind turbine requires a considerable concrete foundation and when this is multiplied for an entire installation of wind turbines the volume of concrete involved is greater than that required to build a complete functioning nuclear power plant. Another downside to both wind and solar is that they both have high maintenance cost compared to nuclear power. In wind turbines this is down to their adverse working conditions and the inevitable wear on expensive moving parts. In solar the relatively short working lifetime of solar cells combined with the expensive material used in photovoltaic coating means that the costs are similarly high. I am sure there are more points to be made but I am leaving some, hopefully, to be highlighted by my opponent and/or some for later remarks.	PRO	225

Sb4dd798f-Af7989c0a	Nuclear Energy	I thank my opponent for his response. I would like to bring to my opponent’s attention that I will be leaving town Sunday and will not be able to continue this debate after that, so I hope that my opponent will be hasty in his responses so that this debate may conclude before then. My opponent’s first contention is that there are no suitable locations for nuclear power plants to be constructed. However, my opponent fails to realize several things. Firstly, regulations at both the state and federal level mean that nuclear power plants constructed in the United States are among the safest, most secure in the world. The plants are very resilient to natural disasters. For example, in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster several safety concerns were raised over U.S. nuclear facilities. One such plant was the Callaway Nuclear Plant near Fulton, Missouri which is located less than 500 miles away than one of the most active fault lines in North America: the New Madrid Fault. In the event that an earthquake caused damage to the facilities at Callaway there are several safety measures that could be activated to avert disaster, including: -Billions of gallons of fresh water from the Missouri River (which is located only a few miles away) could be pumped into the reactors to cool them -Backup diesel generators would supply emergency power, meaning that water could continue to be pumped into the reactors even if the plant had to be powered-down -The plant is capable of being powered down completely in several ways -Equipment at the Callaway site would detect any major, seismic activity and immediately power down the plant [1] In response to my opponent’s claim that U.S. nuclear facilities would be targets of terrorist activity, I will have to agree with him. Radical, Islamic terrorists would love to cause just a partial meltdown at a nuclear power plant near a major American city. However, once again precautions already in place would prevent such from happening. U.S. nuclear facilities are very secure in the sense that they have a 24-hour security presence and semi-restricted airspace exists around all U.S. nuclear facilities. In the post 9/11 world, the notion that anybody with malicious intentions could gain access to an American nuclear facility is simply speculative and unsubstantiated. As it is clear to see, the safety precautions at U.S. nuclear power sites help safeguard them from natural and man made disasters. By opponent’s second point of contention is that nuclear power plant’s require a large amount of monetary investment in the form of licensing and construction costs. However, I have some points that I would like to bring up in refutation of his argument. Firstly, one of the main goals of extra government investment into nuclear power would be the reduction of start-up costs. More government investment could lead to the formation of new, less costly construction techniques that would consequently increase the feasibility of nuclear power plant construction. One method by which government could lower the costs of nuclear power would be removing two-hurdle licensing and encouraging uniform design. Two-hurdle licensing is method of licensing still used in some states that require a license be obtained in order to construct the plant and an additional license be acquired to actually operate the plant. In some instances, this delayed the dates of the plants’ planned openings by several years resulting in additional, unseen costs. The worst case scenario happened at the Shoreham Plant on Long Island which was constructed but never allowed to operate. It is estimated that this cost New York taxpayers over five billion dollars [2]. By streamlining, the licensing process the government could lower costs associated with nuclear development. Even still though, the government could go a step further and encourage uniform design. Currently, all U.S. nuclear power plants are highly specific and use unique, one-of-a-kind equipment. This increases costs because it costs extra money to develop all of the unique equipment required for nuclear power plant construction. Also, it lengthens the construction process because all of the unique equipment has to be inspected and approved by federal regulators. By using tax credits and tax waivers, the federal government and state governments could encourage uniform design. [2] In his third contention, my opponent claims that investment should be directed towards cleaner, “greener” sources of energy. My opponent has made a mistake. He has assumed that by “investment” I mean additional funding into nuclear power plant development. However, by reviewing the definitions posted in Round 1--one can clearly see that the term “investment” does not just mean money. One way in which to increase investment in nuclear power would be to streamline and simplify the licensing process--something that would not require any additional funding. Secondly, my opponent claims that it is foolish to invest in nuclear power when so many “better” energy sources exist. However, more careful examination reveals some alarming facts about the practicality of wind energy. Windmills are extremely large, yet produce very little electricity. If the fully operable windmills in California, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington and Oregon were to run and produce electricity, the amount produced would be equal to one-third of 1% of the electricity produced in the United States in one year [3]. In addition, these wind farms impair environmental, ecological, scenic and property values, for obvious reasons. The bulk of the windmills become an eyesore in many scenic areas, may affect bird migration, and potentially would adversely impact ecological rarities. In his fourth point, my opponent brings up the environmental concerns related to nuclear waste and the availability of uranium resources. I agree with my opponent in saying that the waste produced by nuclear power plants is a real concern and that uranium and plutonium are not infinite resources. However, the nuclear waste problem is one that has been solved for quite some time. Regulations by the EPA, the DoE require that nuclear waste be disposed in such a manner that keeps it safe for at least one million years [4]. Burying the waste underground is a sensible means of disposal as it reduces its environmental impact while keeping it safely away from the human population. Also, as advances in technology continue one option that may become available for nuclear disposal is that nuclear waste be launched into outer space. Imagine, our nuclear waste hundreds of light-years away! How is disposal in this manner not environmentally friendly. My opponent also makes a point about the availability of uranium and plutonium--these things are not infinite resources. However, recent studies by independent agencies seem to suggest that the world holds more radioactive material than one might think. In fact, we have not reached “peak uranium” and new uranium deposits are being discovered everyday [5]. Also, recycled radioactive material form nuclear waste and decommissioned nuclear weapons serves as a major source of nuclear energy. While estimates are somewhat arbitrary, scientists predict that enough uranium exists in the world to sustain nuclear energy for several hundred years [5]. I would also like to point out to my opponent that he supplied no sources and did not even challenge my contentions. Thus, at this point I can claim to win by default. [1]http://www.kmov.com...

S3b786af9-Ae9885de6	Nuclear Power Vs. Solar Power (Future Electrical Needs)	First, the solar plant my opponent cites is a 14 megawatt solar plant that cost $100 million to build. For this cost to power ratio to be extrapolated to the size of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Plant That I cited it would cost ((1500megawatts/14megawatts)*$100 Million) over $10 billion, and it would still produce less electricity because it is a solar cell, solar plant (20% capacity factor at best). Second, My opponent then cited a concentrating solar plant that produces 365 Megawatts. However this plant will not be operational until October 2013 (2), and it cost 2.18 billion to build, with a capacity factor of only 28% My opponent then completely skews the statistics about nuclear power plants. They Cited the cost for 2200 megawatts worth of nuclear power, and then a capacity factor from outside the US (Capacity Factor in the us-90%+). They then cite a 365 Megawatt reactor built in the late 1960’s as the Nuclear reactor’s capacity. After all of this, My El-Cheapo Nuclear and Solar plants still stand as factual, because the nuclear plant is a real and operational one (4), and the solar plant was extrapolated from the cheapest cost per kilowatt hour I could find. Arguments: Cost: The fact stands that I showed Solar Power costs twice as much per megawatt as nuclear over its lifespan ($37 Vs $16). Also, after extrapolating the solar plant you cited to 1500 Megawatts, it actually cost more than $10 billion (more than the 1500 megawatt nuclear plant cost), and it would still produce 1/5th the electricity per year. You must also remember that solar plants do not produce power at night, so the cost of multi-gigawatt hour batteries must be factored in for use at night. At $250 per kilowatt/hour, gigawatt batteries would cost more than a billion dollars. A Nuclear plant can simply run all night. Capacity: My opponent sites a reactor from the 1960’s as the Capacity of nuclear power plants, although I cited a fully operational nuclear plant that produces 1500 megawatts (4 times what my opponents $2.18 billion solar plant produces), and it would only cost $8 billion to build. Also the Grand Gulf Nuclear Plant has a capacity factor of 90%, but my opponents solar plant has a capacity factor of less than 30% (2,3,4). Life Span: Nuclear Plants have been known to run for 60+ years, and they have done so in real life (5). There is not one commercial solar operation in the world that has been used at full capacity for longer than 30 years. Land Use: The Fact still stands that 6x as much land would have to be destroyed for the comparable solar plant to be build. That means 6x as many plants and animals would lose their habitats, and many desert animals are already endangered, so solar would further endanger these species. Also, solar plants built in the desert would have to transmit their power for thousands of miles, whereas Nuclear plants can be built close to the source of demand. This means that 7%+ of the solar energy generated could be lost to transmission losses (6). Safety: Nuclear power is actually the safest power source in the world. Comparing deaths/TWh for all energy sources (7) Energy Source Death Rate (deaths per TWh) Coal – world average 161 (26% of world energy, 50% of electricity) Coal – China 278 Coal – USA 15 Oil 36 (36% of world energy) Natural Gas 4 (21% of world energy) Biofuel/Biomass 12 Peat 12 Solar 0.44(less than 0.1% of world energy) Wind 0.15 (less than 1% of world energy) Hydro 0.10 (Europe death rate, 2.2% of world energy) Nuclear 0.04 (5.9% of world energy) Nuclear power kills less people per terawatt produced than any other form of power in the world, 1/10th of the people per terawatt that solar kills! Conclusion: I have proven that Nuclear power is cheaper, can produce more electricity, lasts twice as long in real life, uses less land, and causes less deaths per terawatt produced. I have used completely honest statistics to do so, and my opponent has mixed and matched data to prove their case (such as listing the cost of a 365 Megawatt solar plant, as the cost of a 14-megawatt solar plant).

Sf1a21dd4-A80184062	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"Generic Arguments: 1)Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level . Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature. The 100-year linear trend (1906-2005) of 0.74 [0.56 to 0.92]ï¿½C 1 is larger than the corresponding trend of 0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]◦C (1901-2000) given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Figure SPM.1). The temperature increase is widespread over the globe, and is greater at higher northern latitudes. Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans (Figures SPM.2, SPM.4). {1.1, 1.2} Rising sea level is consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Global average sea level has risen since 1961 at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3]mm/yr and since 1993 at 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8]mm/yr, with contributions from thermal expansion, melting glaciers and ice caps, and the polar ice sheets. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variation or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. {1.1} Observed decreases in snow and ice extent are also consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]% per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]% per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover on average have declined in both hemispheres. {1.1} From 1900 to 2005, precipitation increased significantly in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe and northern and central Asia but declined in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia. There is observational evidence of an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, with limited evidence of increases elsewhere. There is no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. It is difficult to ascertain longer term trends in cyclone activity, particularly prior to 1970. Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1300 years. {1.1 Observational evidence4 from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases. Changes in snow, ice and frozen ground have with high confidence increased the number and size of glacial lakes, increased ground instability in mountain and other permafrost regions, and led to changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems. There is high confidence that some hydrological systems have also been affected through increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed rivers, and of the more than 29,000 observational data series, from 75 studies, that show significant change in many physical and biological systems, more than 89% are consistent with the direction of change expected as a response to warming . (1) You have failed to provide any evidence to my 150,000 deaths a year; so I will back it up with evidence. ""Climate change already is claiming more than 150,000 lives each year, with causes ranging from heat waves to respiratory illness, WHO concluded last year."" (2) 2)The problem does exist: Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. And experts think the trend is accelerating: the 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1990. Scientists say that unless we curb global warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century.(3) The problem would be solved: By 2050, biofuels -- especially cellulosic biofuels -- could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 1.7 billion tons per year. That's equal to more than 80 percent of current transportation-related emissions.(4) Topicalities: A.Definition of Alternative Energy: energy, as solar, wind, or nuclear energy, that can replace or supplement traditional fossil-fuel sources, as coal, oil, and natural gas. (5) This shows that although Alternative Energy can include the sources that you said, the true definition is energy that can replace traditional fossil-fuel sources. B.(Haha, one of the changes I made to my case was changing 7% to ""Minimally Sufficient up to 20%) You said that I would give a tax break to farmers growing the bean, but I stated that the tax break would go to businesses switching to Jatropha bean alternative energy. Your plan standard is irrelevant to the case because it is on the basis of incentives to farmers when the true incentives go to businesses. B. Logistics: the planning, implementation, and coordination of the details of a business or other operation. (6) My logistics pertains to the way that the mandate would be planned. Funding Disadvantage: A. The Jatropha bean can be implemented with cash crops (""Normal Crops"") and it will actually make the soil better increasing the output. Jatropha is seen by many to be the perfect biodiesel crop. It can be grown in very poor soils actually generating top soil as it goes, is drought and pest resilient, and it has seeds with up to 40% oil content. - Jatropha grows well on low fertility soils - Jatropha can be intercropped with many cash crops such as coffee, sugar, fruits and vegetables with the Jatropha offering both fertilizer and protection against livestock. - Jatropha can survive three years of drought by dropping its leaves. - Jatropha is excellent at preventing soil erosion, and the leaves it drops act as a wonderful soil enriching mulch. - The cost of 1000 jatropha saplings in Pakistan is around 5000PKR (equiv to around ï¿½50 or just 5p each).(7) B. The endorsement of Jatropha has tended to be a big money venture. That has not been undertaken on a larger scale. Jatropha is more of pure fuel crop, though the oil can serve certain other applications. (8) C-E: No evidence. I would also like to mention that you dropped my Oil Dependence and Peak Oil problems. You speak that there is a potential decrease in American exporting (leading to an economic decline) although this is not the case, Jatropha would increase economicic stability due to increased food output (Read through Jatropha statistics). Oil dependence shows that with our continued use of Oil we are supporting terrorist organizations in the Middle East (And those organizations have revolutionized warfare). If we continue to funnel money into terrorist organizations through Oil dependence we are destroying possibilty of stability (Military stability, Economic stability, and Political Stability). Peak oil also shows that without biodiversity we will have an economic decline with the impact of extinction. We cannot stand idly by as we leave chances of the destruction of civilization itself. In conclusion, if Aff's plan is not followed, the destruction of civilization ensues. (1) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, November 16, 2007, http://www.ipcc.ch...

Thanks and good luck to my opponent… Round 1/2: Constructives Round 3/4: Rebuttals I affirm: Resolved: Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the United States. Resolutional Analysis: The resolution specifies that ONLY incentives need to be ""substantially increased"" for the affirmative. Certainly the debate can talk about these effects (good and bad) but affirmative must only provide a plan to increase the incentives of the specified energy source. INHERENCY A. Fusion energy -Wikipedia -""The basic concept behind any fusion reaction is to bring two or more atoms very close together, close enough that the strong nuclear force in their nuclei will pull them together into one larger atom. If two light nuclei fuse, they will generally form a single nucleus with a slightly smaller mass than the sum of their original masses. The difference in mass is released as energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula E = mcï¿½. If the input atoms are sufficiently massive, the resulting fusion product will be heavier than the reactants, in which case the reaction requires an external source of energy. The dividing line between ""light"" and ""heavy"" is iron. Above this atomic mass, energy will generally be released in nuclear fission reactions, below it, in fusion."" B. The Sun -Wikipedia - ""The Sun is a natural fusion reactor."" -Spider-Man 2 -""The power of the sun in the palm of my hand."" C. Fusion power into energy -Wikipedia -""The idea of using human-initiated fusion reactions was first made practical for military purposes, in nuclear weapons. In a hydrogen bomb, the energy released by a fission weapon is used to compress and heat fusion fuel, beginning a fusion reaction which can release a very large amount of energy. The first fusion-based weapons released some 500 times more energy than early fission weapons. Civilian applications, in which explosive energy production must be replaced by a controlled production, are still being developed. Although it took less than ten years to go from military applications to civilian fission energy production, it was very different in the fusion energy field, more than fifty years having already passed without any energy production plant being started up."" HARMS A. Gasoline Prices -www.feulgaugereport.com -‘The approximate gasoline price is around $3.50 per gallon and $115 per barrel' (approximately) B. Lack of Fusion Power -Wikipedia -""Fusion power commonly proposes the use of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, as fuel and in many current designs also use lithium. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the current global output and that this does not increase in the future, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years, lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years.""

The plan will allow the $150 million dollars ""zeroed out"" by Congress. -From- http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org...... -""The 2009 request includes $214.5 million for work on the international fusion experiment, ITER, after Congress zeroed out the promised $150 million U.S. contribution for 2008"" C. The US Federal Government will increase the money stated (from B) by 12%. D. The US Federal Government will create a emergency fund for necessary purposes for the group of scientists. E. I claim the rights to fiat, clarification and legislative intent. F. Funding will be from normal means. SOLVENCY: Incentives of Fusion energy will be substantially increased. Advantage 1: All Status Quo harms will be solved Advantage 2: Abundant Fuel Supply to decrease tensions and save money -From: http://www.pppl.gov...... -""The major fuel, deuterium, may be readily extracted from ordinary water, which is available to all nations. The surface waters of the earth contain more than 10 million tons of deuterium, an essentially inexhaustible supply. The tritium required would be produced from lithium, which is available from land deposits or from sea water which contains thousands of years' supply. The world-wide availability of these materials would thus eliminate international tensions caused by imbalance in fuel supply."" Advantage 3: No risk of Nuclear Accident -Same Source -""The amounts of deuterium and tritium in the fusion reaction zone will be so small that a large uncontrolled release of energy would be impossible. In the event of a malfunction, the plasma would strike the walls of its containment vessel and cool."" Advantage 4: No Air Pollution -Same Source -""Since no fossil fuels are used, there will be no release of chemical combustion products because they will not be produced."" Advantage 5: No High-Level Nuclear Waste -Same Source -""Similarly, there will be no fission products formed to present a handling and disposal problem. Radioactivity will be produced by neutrons interacting with the reactor structure, but careful materials selection is expected to minimize the handling and ultimate disposal of activated materials."" Advantage 6: No Generation of Weapons Material -Same Source -""Another significant advantage is that the materials and by-products of fusion are not suitable for use in the production of nuclear weapons."" I reserve the right to add evidence, extend on any arguments, and create new arguments in the next round. With the increase of fusion energy incentives, many advantages will be reached. We are in the age of new energy and it is about time that we begin looking to many new forms of energy. With the increase of fusion energy incentives, that becomes possible. Therefore, I urge an Affirmative vote. Thank You!"	PRO	233

S66699e25-Acdcdad90	Nuclear power presents the only viable option for reducing CO2 output	"I perhaps should have put ""Nuclear power presents the only currently viable option for reducing CO2 output"" You have quoted two different sources: http://www.eia.gov... http://www.world-nuclear.org... The second of these also produced an economic study of various power generation technologies where nuclear power is cheaper than other alternatives. http://www.world-nuclear.org... Even in your cited source the cost of nuclear power is competitive and its cost range from max-min is narrower than wind power meaning more predictable cost. When also considering that nuclear is always on when wind is variable it is fair to say that in terms of output reliability nuclear power offers a high degree of confidence in price and capacity. If you read the article to the end: http://www.scientificamerican.com... You will see that at current levels with current methods 200 years is a good approximation but if you take into account new technologies and already understood but not widely used methods you will see that terrestrial supplies would last upwards of 30000 years. That is slightly beside the point though we need CO2 reduction and we need it yesterday wind and nuclear offer the only two currently competitively priced methods for power generation. Large areas of land suitable for wind generation have already been developed and from your own source offshore wind is uneconomical. Put that with the fact that wind is intermittent and not predictable beyond extremely short time-scales(days possibly weeks) and the fact there is no tested grid level storage solution available yet and nuclear power has an obvious advantage. I am not saying that the world needs to be all nuclear in fact a mix of generation methods is better and in the future I, like you, hope that solar will become cheaper and fill the gap but we need change now and we have a proven technology that can fill the role. Even in a future where solar is the dominant method of generation I believe there is a place for nuclear as a base load power source. I hope in the form of fusion currently moving towards positive energy output at ITER. I would also look at LFTR's which breed fuel, have a small actinide footprint and are inherently safe as they operate at low pressures and have fail safes that operate even with power failures. http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org... http://www.iter.org... The storage is cost effective and is taken into account in when calculating the total cost per kW. It is also incredibly safe, there is a misconception that radioactive waste is ""dangerous"" for tens of thousands of years. In reality the radioactivity of stored waste falls to within safe levels in a relatively short time after this point the major risk is form heavy metals not from radioactivity. Considering the locations and methods used for waste disposal and the time scales involved in geological processes the threat of an dangerous accident at a disposal site on a probability scale is approaching zero. The cost of $140billion is tiny compared to the cost of irreversible climate change in 2013 the GWP was approximately $75trillion the predicted cost of 4degC temperature change is 1-5% of GWP I will be optimistic and say 2% that would have been $1.5trillion lost in 2013 alone assuming the global economy will grow this figure will be even greater by the time we reach 4degC. Another way of looking at it would be to divide the cost across all the operating nuclear power plants for the rest of their lifetime and again this would result in a rather small number. Taking figures out of context is not representative of the industry as a whole, another good example of this is with radiation leaks even. Taking into account all of the nuclear accidents and tests there have been; coal fired power plants have still released more radiation into the environment than the nuclear industry has over its lifetime. hhtp://www.ipcc.ch... http://en.wikipedia.org... ""Disaster"" is another exaggeration of what happened at Fukushima yes a large amount of radioactive material was released but aside from some mature freshwater fish most areas and foodstuffs have already dropped back to close to levels where any effects would not be statistically separable from the effects of background radiation. A study has even shown that animals living in and around the town of Chernobyl experience a lower incidence of cancer than those from areas with lower levels of radiation. The work, I think, is ongoing but the theory is that low level radiation induces the turning on of more DNA proof reading enzymes in the animal affected thus resulting in higher fidelity during DNA transcription. So low level radiation may not be harmful it may in fact be beneficial. http://en.wikipedia.org... One final note if ITER is energy positive it will be proof of concept and scaling up will have a huge energy output also it will breed some of its own fuel and the rest can be relatively easily extracted from water this would last us for the foreseeable future whilst having an extremely low waste footprint and reliable energy output."

See0f4916-Ab213cec5	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"His first argument is that if we can ""irresponsibly spend"", we can do the plan, and that we should maintain our national ""credit score"" and have a responsible plan for repayment of our debts. However, although it may make us feel good to have thrifty savers and spenders in Congress, he has yet to point out WHY excessive deficit spending is bad. We have engaged in massive deficit spending for years, with the deficit going up in some years, and down in others. During World War II, the deficit soared, and yet in the 1990's, we had a budget surplus. So why is the deficit too high now? How high does it need to get before the situation becomes critical? He cannot simply say that we need to be responsible unless he shows the consequences of being IRRESPONSIBLE. Until he shows some major impact to continued deficit spending, I will continue to argue that saving the world from biosphericide is more important than adding a few hundred million to the deficit. 2. His second argument is that I focus only on IFR's, and not on alternative energy as a whole. However, I don't have a burden to defend EVERY type of alternative energy. Rather, I chose one specific case which proves the general proposition, because this allows us to discuss the issue in greater depth. An in depth discussion of these issues is preferable to shallow, surface-level debate about 17 different types of energy. 3. His third argument is that the IFR is a ""pet project"" and that the government can only spend money on projects which have gathered significant public interest, and spending on ""pet projects"" is unconstitutional and a betrayal of the voters unless it is comparatively better than other needs. This argument is so totally baseless and without evidence that I'm not even sure how to respond. I guess I'll make several points: a. He has articulated no impact to spending money on pet projects. He argues that it may be unconstitutional, or a betrayal of voters, but I will answer that below. Other than that, he doesn't say WHY pet projects are bad. If a pet project will prevent the agonizing death of billions, then we should do it, regardless of whether or not it has widespread public support. b. Congress spends money on pet projects all the time. Almost every piece of spending legislation contains ""pork barrel"" projects designed to curry favor with a legislator's voters. Again, he doesn't say why THIS project is bad, only that in general such projects are bad. But if that's true, why haven't we seen the impacts he describes? c. Congress has the right to spend money on pretty much whatever it wants, and the taxpayers have only one remedy: vote the legislator out of office. In Frothingham v. Mellon, the Supreme Court said that taxpayers do not have a right to sue the government to stop unconstitutional government spending, unless the spending PERSONALLY affects them in some special or unique way as compared to other taxpayers. Furthermore, the Supreme Court in Helvering v. Davis said that the constitution gives the Congress the power to spend money on whatever it considers the ""national good"" without having its judgment challenged. Thus, because it is reasonable that saving the world from biosphericide is in the national good, spending money on even a ""pet project"" is not unconstitutional. 4. His fourth argument is that the free market has developed long term innovations in the past, and to allow the government to subsidize IFR development violates the ""cardinal"" of free competition. But why is free market competition good? He makes the argument that government funding of IFR's will distort the free market. Fine. But he still has the burden to show why this is bad. What will happen if IFR funding distorts the free market? IFR's won't be built by the free market, so the choice is between a distorted market with IFR technology, or a free market with traditional nuclear power. I have shown that we risk biosphericide if we use the free market. What is the impact to distorting the free market? 5. His fifth argument is that government acting to stop waste dumping in Yucca Mountain is fine, but investing in a company gives it unfair competition. I have three points: a. The IFR was developed at Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. We can't begin to mass produce IFR's until the prototype is completed for government inspection and review. The funding is going to a national laboratory. I don't see how this creates some kind of new ""nationalized entity with unlimited resources"" to compete against private firms. The laboratory already exists. The prototype was only 2-3 years away from completion in the mid 1990's. This funding will complete the prototype so it can be mass produced. b. I sincerely hope that he's not arguing that government investment into research violates the free market. Without government research, we would not have the internet, which was created by the pre-cursor to DARPA. According to Neil Osterweil of the MedPage Daily, the National Institute for Health provides 28% of all funding for bio-medical research. He continues to claim that government investment would interfere in the ""supposedly open market."" However, the there is no ""open market"" – we subsidize the oil and coal industry now. If those subsidies were to end, coal and oil would become more expensive, and the ""energy crisis"" would return, and IFR's might seem economically competitive. However, because that is essentially impossible, the free market will continue to use oil, coal, and traditional nuclear – dooming the planet to biosphericide. c. Finally, on the off chance that he actually presents some evidence showing why the free market is good, I'll preempt that. The free market is terrible. According to Dr. Richard Robbins, capitalism and the free market will inevitably destroy the earth for four reasons: i. The technological revolution, including pesticides and automobiles, has done potentially irreversible damage to the environment. Regardless of the global warming debate, the millions of cars emitting pollution, the industrial waste, the contamination of waterways, and the destruction of forests have stressed the earth to its breaking point. ii. The free market has led a consumption movement which will cause cataclysmic change. In the drive to consume more goods, we have destroyed a large amount of our natural resources in order to turn it into ""consumable products."" Even the destruction happening in developing countries is caused by their supply of raw materials to be produced into products which we purchase. iii. Modern American lifestyles have influenced the free market to produce large amounts of beef for our consumption. However, cattle use huge amounts of resources compared to growing grains such as rice, and as the demand for beef will increase in the U.S. and developing countries, more strain will be put on the environment. iv. The free market prevents the development of an effective environmental movement. Poll after poll shows that Americans, even conservatives, support efforts to protect the environment. However, this is not translated into action because environmentalism conflicts with capitalism. The destruction of the planet due to ecological catastrophe is beyond the lifespan of any individual living now. Any rational free market participant would conclude that they shouldn't care about the environment, because ""in the long run, we'll all be dead."" Thus, the only people who have an economic incentive to care about the environment will be those who are living when the problem threatens their survival – and by then, it will be too late. 6. His sixth and final argument is that if federal subsidies are not the best way to reach alternative energy, then we should do them. However, he completely ignores all of my points from 3d from Round 2. I only have to prove that we SHOULD do the plan, not that it is the BEST plan."	PRO	236
Sa6b760ce-A58bf8aa9	Nuclear power.	"Thanks for starting the debate off, TBR. I agree that we face some difficult energy challenges, especially given the problem of climate change and looming carbon constraints. So this is definitely an important topic and I'm excited to finally debate it. With that said, I'll jump right in to my arguments. -- There are insolvable infrastructural, economic, social, and environmental problems with nuclear power. These insolvable problems include enormous complexity and immense capital costs (nuclear isn't ""relatively simple and cost effective"" as TBR claims), as well as problems with reactor safety, waste storage, vulnerability to the effects of climate change, weaponization of uranium, and vulnerability to terrorist attack. Renewables do better on every front. They're more efficient, safer, they provide significant environmental benefits, they don't depend on foreign sources of uranium (so they're more reliable), and they're also not as vulnerable to terrorism or to the effects of climate change. (1) Nuclear power is prohibitively expensive. Renewables are cheaper than nuclear. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says the average cost of electricity produced by a next-generation nuclear plant (which is cheaper than current plants) is $0.1084 per kilowatt-hour (""kWh""), and the soonest we can get these advanced plants running is 2018. The EIA also says the average cost of solar is $0.1443/kWh, and the average cost of wind is $0.0866/kWh. [1] But the EIA has historically overestimated the cost of renewables, and underestimated the cost of conventional sources. [2] The new 50-MW Macho Springs solar plant in New Mexico will deliver power for $0.0508/kWh. [3] Other US solar projects come in the range of $0.07 to $0.09/kWhh. [4] According to these recent numbers, the cost of solar is already half that of advanced nuclear power in 2018. And the cost of solar is still falling, while the cost of nuclear continues to rise. [5] Moreover, the EIA's analysis didn't take into account construction costs, insurance costs, decommissioning costs, and waste management costs. A recent study by MIT shows that including plant construction costs in the equation increases the cost to $0.7 or $0.8 per kWh. [6] Decommission easily costs $3 billion per plant. [7] And the costs of waste management -- which were estimated at $96 billion in 2008 -- are ongoing and rising, because nuclear waste keeps building up, and it lasts thousands of years. [8] There's also the costs of cleanup after a meltdown; for example, the costs of Fukushima, the most recent catastrophe, is estimated at $100 billion. [9] Also consider the costs of uranium mining, which is already expensive because it creates serious health problems, and which will only continue to increase as uranium becomes a scarce resource. These costs are borne by taxpayers, and without taxpayer investments, nuclear plants wouldn't ever be built. Even after a trillion-dollar taxpayer investment, nuclear power has only grown 1% per year. [10] One commentator notes that ""even while the nuclear industry is able to externalize its costs for insurance (which are federally limited), loan guarantees (which are federally backstopped), decommissioning (which is pushed onto ratepayers) and waste handling (which is pushed onto taxpayers), it still lost. If it had to stand on its own and pay its full insurance costs like every other energy source, we could never build another nuclear plant in America, because no private investors would be willing to take that kind of risk."" [11] (2) Nuclear power isn't a solution to climate change. TBR's right that nuclear power emits almost no carbon dioxide (""C02""). Renewables also emit almost no C02. But here's what TBR doesn't tell you: nuclear power has higher costs than renewables per unit of net C02 displaced. [12] That means that every dollar we invest in nuclear power buys less C02 reduction than if the dollar were spent on renewables. The importance of investing our dollars wisely in the fight against climate change suggests that renewables are a better option than nuclear, as renewable sources are a cheaper (and faster) way to reduce C02. TBR also doesn't mention that vast amounts of fossil fuels must be burned to mill, mine, leech, transport, and enrich uranium, and to build and decommission nuclear plants. [13] For example, ""in 2002, the Paducah [uranium] enrichment plant [in Kentucky] released over 197.3 metric tons of Freon, [a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide]."" [14] Moreover, the Oxford Research Group projects nuclear power will generate as much carbon dioxide per kWh as comparable gas-fired power stations by 2050, because of uranium depletion. [15] This bears repeating: at current levels of nuclear power generation, by 2050 nuclear plants will be producing as much GHG as some fossil fuel plants. Finally, note that renewable energy is faster and cheaper to roll out than nuclear, which is a critical factor given the tightness of the timeframe vis-à-vis climate change. It takes 10 to 19 years to build a new nuclear plant. The latest research on renewable energy, most notably by Mark Jacobson’s team at Stanford, shows that a global transition to 100 percent renewable energy -- “wind, water and solar” -- is both technically and economically feasible by 2030. [16] That means lowering GHG emissions in line with science-based targets doesn't require building a global network of new nuclear plants. Mark Jacobson notes that “if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables, you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait, and wait, for the nuclear age to arrive. We will also guarantee a riskier future for us all.” [13] (3) Nuclear power is vulnerable to terrorist attack. Because of the potential mass destruction, nuclear plants are a major target for terrorists. 9/11 would be tiny by comparison. If a plane were flown into a nuclear plant, the disaster would be immeasurably worse than Chernobyl. For instance, ""John Large, an international independent expert on nuclear power, has said that if a plane was flown into the nuclear waste storage tanks at Sellafield, the whole of the English Midlands could be catastrophically contaminated."" [17] Terrorists could also target waste sites, for a similar effect. Terrorists could also steal nuclear materials by attacking storage facilities, processing facilities, uranium mines, or by intercepting nuclear materials in transit. The more nuclear power expands, the more opportunities that become available for using (or diverting) nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. These risks, including the potential fatalities, must be taken into account. (4) Nuclear power is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the last decade, extreme weather, flooding, and storm surge have increasingly made nuclear plants unsafe to operate, requiring temporary shutdowns. For example, three plants were shut down in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, leaving many people without power for extended periods of time in cold weather. [18] Anticipated effects from climate change are going to interfere with nuclear plants. So the idea that nuclear power provides reliable baseload power isn't going to hold up. Plants along low-lying coastal areas will be particularly vulnerable to storm surge and hurricanes, and might even become permanently unusable due to sea level rise. And note that rising seas and flooding don't just create a risk of shutdown, but also a risk of releasing hazardous materials, like what happened at Fukushima. These potential safety issues are going to require more and more administrative oversight over time. Moreover, climate change could increase security threats from terrorists, complicating efforts to prevent terrorist attacks on nuclear plants and waste disposal sites. Climate change increases the risk and uncertainty associated with nuclear power. Given the high upfront costs of building new nuclear plants, and the difficulty of adapting them to climate change (because they're large and centralized), renewables are a better option going forward. Renewables are decentralized and small, which makes them easier to move, and it also makes them more reliable in the case of extreme weather. Renewables are spread out so that when one wind farm goes out, you still have electricity. Nuclear doesn't work that way, so it's actually less reliable than renewables (also, another reliability point is the dependence on foreign uranium, which renewables don't need). (5) Nuclear power is prohibitively dangerous. Should failure occur, the consequences are probably the worst of any high risk activity that humans engage in. There have already been four nuclear accidents: Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. Each accident was unique, and each was supposed to have been impossible. Yet each happened. 985,000 people died from Chernobyl between 1986 and 2004. [17] We don't know the figure for deaths from Fukushima yet, but note that it's the worst industrial disaster in history. It led to three simultaneous, complete meltdowns which proved impossible to stop or contain for years, and these meltdowns are still pouring radiation pollution across the Japanese landscape. Failures like these can and will continue to happen. The risks and costs are too high. Sources: [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com...

S78068d61-Ad7572789	Nuclear power should be banned	"Yay, I managed to get this short enough at last! I thank con for getting this going. In doing this debate, I follow in the great tradition of New Zealand's former prime minister David Lange. In 1985 at Oxford Union, in a debate so intense even the US president tuned in, he fought against Jerry Falwell, a noted friend of then-US-president Ronald Regan, arguing against the motion ""nuclear weapons are morally indefensible"". Lange became the first person in decades to recieve a standing ovation from both sides of the house [1]. Today I am arguing against nuclear energy. Not just big civilian nuclear power plants. Not just nuclear weapons. Not just nuclear clocks or submarines. I argue that the use of nuclear power in all its forms is morally indefensible. After Lange's awesome speech, New Zealand abolished nuclear weapons. Despite claims by the US that we'd need nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines patrolling our shores, and so on and so forth, we have remained nuclear free to this day [2]. And guess what? We're not facing an energy crisis. Our national defense is far less at risk than that of every single nuclear country. And our people have never regretted the decision. Recently, Germany, a major nuclear nation, said they will move toward doing the same as New Zealand by 2022. So far progress has been good, indicating that it is not beyond the realm of possibility for other large nations to follow our lead. Today, I argue that such a model would be beneficial to the whole world, for one simple moral reason. Every nuclear device, when it generates energy, generates waste that we cannot safely dispose of. Take, for instance, the United States in America. The very latest in nuclear technology. The wisest of scientists and engineers. And yet even they dispose of most of their waste by throwing it to the bottom of swimming pools. Incredulously, some people at the NAS actually bothered to examine whether this was dangerous or not, and their results were exactly as you would expect [3]. Some waste is thrown to the bottom of ""sealed"" tunnels, and my opponent's source suggests this is ideal (though they agree it is not what's currently happening due to ""political will""). But consider this - the EPA was recently told, in America, that many of their nuclear deposits could last a million years [4]. No seal can survive that long. Even pure diamond, several meters thick would crack and break, just as all the diamonds from the past million years have cracked and broken. The ground may be stable now, but as it has been unstable in the past million years, so too will it be unstable again. The problem with the waste is that it's radioactive. According to almost every expert, there is no safe level of radioactivity [5]. A Geiger counter only measures how quickly you are approaching your death. We know that miners and plant workers who recieved only mild doses of radiation have died of various cancers [6]. People die from nuclear energy, even when done correctly (mind you, human error doesn't help). Construction costs are rising, construction is taking longer, operational costs are rising [8], and while there are promising next-generation reactors (some of which my opponent mentioned) they should not be legalised for construction until they have been properly scientifically tested. All this is to fund the creation of over 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste every year, from the United States alone [7]. No renewable energy source has a by-product that dangerous or large. This is immoral, because of the heavy cost in human lives. Just as nuclear weapons are bad because of the immediate cost in human lives, so nuclear power is bad because of the long-term cost in human lives. Never forget that just one month before Chernobyl, the Economist said nuclear power was ""as safe as a chocolate factory."" The danger of nuclear weapons is already well-known. A nuclear power station is nothing more than an extremely slow nuclear weapon, not designed to unleash its power in one explosion, but designed slowly to poison. And now on to con's case. Con gives four reasons why recklessly and dangerously polluting the world is OK. I'll deal with them in reverse order. Jobs, his fourth point, is moot because any jobs lost from not having nuclear might equally be gained from having another power source. So instead of people checking on the safety of nuclear reactors, perhaps they can employ engineers to monitor tidal energy constructions. Thirdly con says we get cheap electricity. The US Department of Energy researched this in their ""Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011"". They found that an advanced nuclear power plant could produce electricity at $109-$124 per megawatt hour. That's cheap - but wind energy was only $81-$115. Geothermal was only $91-$115. Hyrdoelectric was $58-$121. Biomass, still in its infancy, was already just $99-$133. So clearly nuclear is far from the cheapest option! Con's sources are largely from the lobby group ""World Nuclear Association"" - in their words, they are ""promoters"" and ""supporters"" of nuclear energy [9] so not exactly an unbiased group! Their membership is comprised of companies who all have a financial stake in nuclear power [10]. Just because my opponent sources some assertions by this unscientific lobby group doesn't mean their claims hold water. His only other relevant source states ""I’m quite frankly more interested in cheaper solar and fuel cell options, which is where I think the primary future of energy generation is headed (with some supplementation from wind and geothermal)"" (emphasis added). Secondly con says nuclear power is safe. I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. The only problem is that when a solar panel breaks down, a couple of people moan because the electricity goes out. When a nuclear plant breaks down, the whole planet jumps up and starts screaming. As I've already sourced, nuclear plants are on a trend of becoming more expensive, countering that part of the argument. And his Wikipedia source about workers being competant states there is a serious accident once every 8 years or so. When dealing with things so contaminative, so dangerous, this is completely unacceptable. And con thinks he can hold these things for a million years after they're in the plant without anything ever going wrong! And we can keep making advancements with my exemption for scientific research. Until we know how to properly contain the waste, we should not deal with it. Firstly, con says nuclear energy is cleaner. There is a danger, I think, of environmentalism being confused with climate change. Climate change is one problem - we face MANY more, including a radiation-filled environment which causes cancers and death. So while nuclear emits less CO2 than solar (if you foolishly exclude construction emmissions and refinement emmissions), the point is that they have a wildly different effect on the environment anyway. I believe renewability may be a problem (uranium is a finite resource) but even if nuclear power was totally sustainable, the sustained destruction of our planet and people would be still worse than temporary destruction. And that thing he says about waste being safe and containable... oh look, that's another unsupported assertion from our new favorite lobby group, the World Nuclear Association. Nuclear power is not green. All of con's arguments just don't hold water. Recently the world has been angry at Iran for developing nuclear technology. I think they're right, but the rest of the world shouldn't be so hypocritic about it! Nuclear power is dangerous. I'll continue my case in a moment, once con has had a chance to respond.

S53275be8-A9ff8c3da	Nuclear power gives countries energy security and self-sufficiency	In addition, the use of nuclear power reduces our foreign energy dependency. The European Union is a net importer for energy, and as such is reliant on Russia and Norway, predominantly, for oil and gas supplies. Events such as the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine over gas supplies demonstrated that the EU's energy can easily be disrupted by political situations outside its control1. It also means that the EU could be drawn into disputes between Russia and neighbouring countries because it has a vested interest in the region. This could set a dangerous precedent, where the EU could be intimidated by Russia, because the EU relies so heavily on Russian gas. Building more nuclear power stations would ensure a more secure supply of energy, thereby avoiding the potential for energy supply to become a politically charged issue on an international scale. 1 'Russia-Ukraine gas dispute', Wikipedia	PRO	240
Sd3d77219-A4ca3ac8c	the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels	"Fuel -- it is combustible matter (like oil, for example) but is also ""an energy source for engines, power plants, or reactors"" http://dictionary.reference.com...; http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...; The resolution, therefore, allows for my discussion of the conventional fuels (Nuclear, Gas, and Coal), which my opponent drops and therefore concedes my argument that they are, on balance, safe and cheap forms of energy which save lives. One of the alternative definitions--an energy source for engines, power plants, or reactors--also encompases my arguments on alternative energy sources, and another drop by my opponent. My opponent also mentions alternative fuels in the more 'obvious' sense, such as ethanol in cars for example. Well, the fatal flaw with ethanol is that it kills starving poverty stricken human beings in third world countries. Using ethanol is simply immoral. These alternative biofuels come from food, such as corn. An increase in the price of food--as supply shrinks for fuel consumption--will mean a few things. (1) a family buys less food, (2) a family buys the same amount of food, but less of other items. The fact is, a poor family who spends its entire income on food and essential equipment will have to buy fewer of one of these essential components to life. Either way, people will die in our attempt to go green. Corn used to be about $3.00 a bushel, now its around $8.00 [1]. The African income is around $315, a year [2]. This means if all an africans income was spent on corn, they would only be able to buy 39 bushels of corn, if each was $8. If it was $3, they could buy 105 bushels of corn. But one has to remember, they spend their income on other things: fuel (such as coal) to heat their homes. To subsidize alternative biofuels is simply immoral and will kill Africans. Further, to regulate and favor forms other than coal in America will also increase the price of coal, which means more people will die of the cold in, say, Lesotho where they are in an arid but in high altitude enviroment. But lets put the price of coal into more perspective: the United States. I live in New Mexico, I am at about 6,000 feet above sea level. There are poor people here, who dont have homes, or live in inadequate homes. In the winter, it gets extremely cold. In the summer, it gets very warm. If you increase the price of energy in this region, people become more succeptible to heat waves of the summer and cold times of the winter. People cant fuel their homes--this is in direct relation to the resolution, as it is a conventional fuel. Further, gas is pretty expensive. Last time I filled my car it was about 3.30 or something. New Mexico is a poor state. To increase gasoline prices with ethanol, you not only make them spend more on their food, their energy, but also at the pump. This means they consume less of other items, lowering their quality of life or in extreme cases, endangering it. The simple fact is, to support these 'clean' alternative forms of energy kills people, and lowers peoples' quality of life. What is the reason to have these biofuels, these alternative energy sources? To stop climate change, which will kill a lot of people supposedly, and reduce pollution which is so bad right now... or nah. Climate change has already stopped. There has been no warming for 17 years and nine months, with a slight cooling trend around 2002 [3]. Further, with the warming we have seen in the 20th century, there is a much closer correlation to the sun than with CO2. CO2 doesnt correlate after 1997, during the cooling mid century, and doesnt correlate with minor flucuations from 1980-1997. The sun correlates with temperature along all of these intervals, and is a much better explanation for the warming of the 20th century [4]. Yep, we switch to ethanol all we want, to be a bit informal and feel a bit like Penn and Teller, it wont do jack sh!t about global warming. Pollution is bad in the US though, right? Nope, wrong. I will get more in depth into this than I did in the following round. Particulate matter in the US has fallen over 50%, toxins from industrial plants has fallen over 70%, and new cars using those old conventional fuels are 90% cleaner than they once were. Average pollutants dropped 20-96%, depending on the pollutant. Aggregate air emissions has fallen 25% 1970, while populatin has increases 39%. Smog has fallen by 1/3 even though the amount of cars has doubled and the distance they travel on average has increased by 143% [5]. Yes, the air is getting cleaner without all of these interventions my opponent espouses. My opponent must prove that: (1) We need these alternatve fuels--even assuming that governments are more efficient and making them be produced, it begs the question whether or not we need them to decrease the climate threat (2) Demonstrate that these alternative fuels--which include ethanol and other sources--will save more lives through a cleaner world than what is lost through increased food prices (3) And three, demonstrade why the current fuels are 'bad', I demonstrated the excellence of coal, gas, nuclear, etc. My opponent has not attempted to refute this, dropping the argument. If the conventional fuels aren't bad, why should we switch to another energy? (4) And 4, prove subsidies are the correct method. The market will choose the most efficient form of energy based on prices. If ethanol was truly efficient, it would not need government intervention. As the Mises instutute argues, ""As with ethanol and recycling and a host of other issues, you must ask yourself again, if these things are so efficient, why do they need to be subsidized? Answer: they're not so efficient.""[6] (5) That these alternative fuels are actually economically efficient. Although ethanol at a glance is cheaper, it leads to less efficiency, increased food prices, and decreased mileage. This means that, in the long run, subsidies are favoring a more expensive energy source which will increase pollution--more gas usage--and also costs, as you have to go to the pump more often [7]. I have provided many convincing arguments throughout the debate as to why conventional energy methods are acceptable, and in many ways superior, than 'alternative' energy sources. My opponent has not provided one logical argument or empirical proof to her opinion. It is like an op-ed... without any facts to prove it. I have cited my assertions with proof and the sources are easily accessible for those who want to make sure what I am saying is true.* *My sources this round are not posting correctly (they keep saying page not found), so I will post a second copy in the comments in hopes that they will work there, for those who wish to read them 1. http://www.forbes.com... 2. http://www.forbes.com... 3. http://wattsupwiththat.com...; 4. http://people.duke.edu...; 5. http://www.manhattan-institute.org...; 6. http://mises.org...; 7. http://www.usnews.com..."

Sdd09931a-Ac0e4227a	Resolved: The United States should Significantly Increase its Use of Nuclear Energy	First I will Go to my opponents case and if space alots I will rebuild my own case First looking to his Contention one and that nuclear plants do not emit carbn dioxide......... This can be blocked in two seperate ways 1st the actual nuclear cycle itself and 2nd how can nuclear energy be efficient....... first to nuclear cycle M V Ramana, Senior Fellow at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Environment and Development,reports on July 1st 2005 that In reality several steps in he nuclear fuel cycle, from Uranium mining to enrichment to reprocessing emit copious amounts of greenhouse gases. What we see is not only are carbon emissions released from nuclear energy but during the early steps to even begin to create nuclear energy release many more emissions. As America Magazine, of June 23, 2008 finds Reactors are only part of the nine-stage nuclear fuel cycle. This cycle includes mining uranium ore, milling it to extract uranium, converting the uranium to gas, enriching it, fabricating fuel pellets, generating power, reprocessing spent fuel, storing spent fuel at the reactor and transporting the waste to a permanent storage facility. Because most of these nine stages are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, nuclear power thus generates at least 33 grams of carbon- equivalent emissions for each kilowatt-hour of electricity that is produced. and as the Oxford Research group finds that because of this if we were to increase are amount of nuclear energy we would have the same amount of CO2 emissions by 2050, So nuclear energy is just going to cause the same problem in 42 years, what we need to look at is other alternatives which are more cost effective and can meet demand Which leads to the efficiancy First we look to the uranium shortage....Dr Youngson cautions that it is too soon to tell how significant this nuclear resurgence will be in the longer run, but the surge in the price of uranium in recent years suggests that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply. The price of uranium increased by more than 1,000 per cent from 2002 to 2007, driven by a perception of tight supply and market speculation. Ambrian's research shows that uranium supply from mining has consistently failed to meet demand since the early 1990s, one of the main reasons being the very long lead times of developing uranium mines. also we look to the demand In addition to being risky, nuclear power is unable to meet our current or future energy needs. as Kristin Ferchette at the university of Notre Dame finds: Because of safety requirements and the length of time it takes to construct a nuclear-power facility, the government says that by the year 2050 atomic energy could supply, at best, 20 percent of U.S. electricity needs; yet by 2020, wind and solar panels could supply at least 32 percent of U.S. electricity, at about half the cost of nuclear power. To Rebuilding: Attack C2 SA) What we need to do is first find a way to store this before we can possibly increase nuclear energy my opponent must show you where we can store this waste before we can even think about increasing nuclear energy SB) In Belarus 2000 kids had to have there thyroids removed due to the noble gases in the air as Dr. Helen Caldicott finds and we look back to my C2 we see that these can lead to genetic diseases, simply the risk is too high SC) Cooling twoers are used across the world, the technology aobviously isnt there, these cooling systems are a problem and need to be fixed, and simply we cant just kill fish now to save them later supposidly C3) The US has not significantly increased nuclear energy, we have to look to foreign examples to see what can possibly happen, and obviously cooling towers cant solve the problem, otherwise nuclear reactors would not be taken offline And Lastly to C4) Jobs is utterly flawed Because no new nuclear power plants have been built in the United States in over 30 years, foreign companies have more experience building such plants. while considering constructing a new nuclear reactor, the American utility Constellation partnered with the French-German company, Areva, to build a model plant in Finland. The United States must produce more electricity to keep up with increasing demand, but relying on foreign companies to build nuclear plants means fewer jobs for Americans in the energy sector. Lastly I would like to bring up a C5) that i have lightly touched on also in minor rebuttal to C4) Wind and Solar are a much better option and safer Jim Harding, former director of power planning and forecasting for Seattle City Light, estimates that nuclear plants constructed today would provide electricity at between 12 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. To put this cost into perspective, the average U.S. electricity price in 2006 was 8.9 cents per kWh, and well-placed wind turbines can produce electricity @ less then 5 cents per kilowatt hour and solar at abou 11 cents per kilowatt hour GoodLuck Opponent	CON	243

See0f4916-A3bca56a3	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"I have only three arguments. How did my opponent stretch it to six?! Anyways, clearly my opponent does not share the view of financial responsibility and is now demanding examples to the consequence of excessive deficit spending. Bearing in mind that it is my opponent's burden of proof to demonstrate necessity FOR diverting resources away from existing projects to IFR development, I shall point to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. Fueled by government incentives, excessive spending on real estate and home purchase distorted truthful reflection of economic value in and beyond real estate-related products and services. The very incentives encouraging a positive and promising ideal of their time, home ownership, became the catalysts bringing the global economic system to its knee. The government can simply curb dumping of nuclear waste at undesirable location and drive up the cost of nuclear energy to promote alternative energy. Why is it impossible? Take away the oil and coal incentives! In respond to the subsequent increase in cost of energy production, the private sector will automatically seek alternative energy developments and implementations. In my second argument, I choose to focus on the general theme demanded by the stated topic. While my opponent is narrowing down to one specific project and hoping to generalize, it is important to remember that the topic requests for substantial increase of [all] alternative energy incentives. More importantly, however, he narrowly concerns himself in the particularly benefits and promises of a single project while ignoring the responsibility and framework of the federal government system. While I completely agree that IFR sounds like a good investment and I will certainly fork my piggy bank over for, the readers should focus on the economic implication of such lavish spending on something which most people are still not so sure about or do not understand. The critical issue is not whether IFR is good; the critical issue is whether the government should be the one investing in it. Arguably, there are many ""good things"" the government can do depending on the standards of the time. However, actions beyond the constitutional framework and widespread public support can easily render influence of the government to the will and desire of special interest and radical groups. Rather than focusing on how good IFR is and making projections in the very uncertain future, my opponent must focus on the responsibility of the federal government and demonstrate why it is the federal government's responsibility to bear the risk of project failure and consequence of breaching free market protocols. Despite the Supreme Court shielding the Congress from legal consequence of excessive and irresponsible spending, the federal government continues to bear the moral and social responsibility of spending on projects of higher priorities shared by the greater population. Finally, my opponent and I spend a great deal of time comparing the pros and cons of the free market mechanism. Refraining myself from pasting my entire introductory economics textbook here, I will simply point to the Chinese market transition from nationalized enterprises to free market competitors. China has practiced resource appropriation since the inception of the communist party until the transformation movement toward capitalism in recent decades, and the difference in economic prosperity has been rather self-evident. My opponent can argue and promote the benefits of policy-based appropriation all he wants, but the federal government must not act until the majority citizens of this country share my opponent's belief. Furthermore, my opponent has also brought up examples focusing on the social area of public interest. The internet, for example, originated as a project for national defense. Our overwhelming proportion of senior citizens also requires government focus on the healthcare front. Both issues rank consistently higher than alternative energy concern in polls and surveys. The question is not whether the IFR project itself is good or bad. The main focus is whether the federal government should divert its limited resource toward something while its people are calling for help in other more immediate and dire concern. To summarize, it is clear that my opponent has focused primarily on the good of the IFR project alone when the debate topic specifically asks for government intervention and resource diversion. His sales pitch may find its audience among venture capitalists or investment bankers who share his vision for future demand and profitability. However, the federal government must adhere itself to the will of its constituents in principle and in practice. From the more recent BP oil spill, we see well-established government protocols for responding to an energy-related environmental issue without interference to the research and development initiatives of off-shore drilling. If the IFR technology is as promising as he claims, then there is no reason why no private participant has stepped up to monopolize all the future profit of this amazing technology. Until the IFR proponents have gathered popular support from the general public, their attempt to solicit government incentive while circumventing market scrutiny shall always be viewed and evaluated with caution and skepticism."

S8da25347-A394b5c24	The United States should fund alternative energy research	This debate has been condensed into a few individual arguments 1. Current Technology 2. Risk 3. Funding Now both 2 and 3 really fall into number 1. My opponent's arguments is this NASA lacks technology NASA takes more funding NASA has more risk My arguments so far have been NASA has technology NASA takes less funding NASA has less risk I would like to FURTHER clearify NASA's role in solar energy NASA employes scientists to work together and mkae tehcnological innovations NASA works together with other agencies to gather technology BUT THE KEY NASA works with private companies This is where a new argument is going to be put in NASA with funding would work better with private companies than funded provate corporations would work with NASA. Here is why. If a private corporation creates new technology, it becomes copyrighted, NASA needs permission to use it, and anyone else NASA is working with needs permission. Competing companies would not share technology, because they would lose profit. NASA gets funding, creates new technology, it becomes copyrighted, and NASA gives it to private corporations they are working with. So what I am saying is: NASA can share technology if they are directed the funding, while private corporations would not. So, onto the pats debates 1. Current Technology http://science.nasa.gov... partially off topic article, but gives proof NASA has technology present http://www.nasa.gov... shows gains made by NASA on solar technology NASA has plenty of technology that currently employ. NASA uses solar panels on the ISS and on satellites. NASA has been using solar panels since the first Mars Rover.

Funding NASA currently has a paycheck from the government. Government tells NASA to divert 10% from all programs into solar energy. Government gives NASA 10 million extra.

Government hires 3 private corporations. 25 million times 3 is 75 million PVT CORPORATION cost 50 million more than NASA. This is just an example with made-up numbers, but the premise is sound. NASA 3, PVT 0 As we can see, NASA can share technology, has technology, has no risk, and requires less funding. Thus, The government should not fund private companies for alternative energy.	CON	246
S991e76d8-Adb8902dc	It is also imperative to look at the alternatives when assessing in what form of energy to invest. …	The proposition lists a number of problems with alternative energy. It is perfectly true that alternative energy is not efficient enough to serve the energy needs of the world’s population today. However, with investment all these methods could be made efficient enough to serve mankind. It is also true that initiation of alternative energy schemes, such as the Aswan dam, have caused problems. But the opposition are not advocating a blanket solution to every problem. Many dam projects, for example, could have been replaced by solar power had the technology been available, without the downside to the dams. In addition, there is almost always one renewable resource that a given country can exploit; tides for islands, the sun for equatorial countries, hot rocks for volcanic regions etc. and so any given country can in principle become self-sufficient with renewable energy. The global distribution of uranium is hugely uneven (much more so than fossil fuels) and the use of nuclear power therefore gives countries with uranium deposits disproportionate economic power. It is far from inconceivable that uranium could be subject to the same kind of monopoly that the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) places on oil. Indeed, if the whole world went over to nuclear power, supplies of usable uranium ore would run out within a few short decades. This prevents countries from achieving self-sufficiency in energy production.	CON	247
Sae50ee6c-Ab1c68f1c	The US Should Subsidize Nuclear Power	"NP = nuclear power WWS = power from wind, water, and sunlight -- If the US wants to reduce global warming, air pollution, and energy instability, it should invest only in the best energy options. NP isn't one of them. WWS is cheaper, cleaner, safer, and faster to deploy (a critical factor given the tight timeframe re: global warming). And WWS has better impacts on global warming, human health, energy security, national security, water supply, wildlife, water pollution, reliability, and sustainability than NP. Most importantly, WWS is technologically and economically feasible. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions doesn't require building a global network of NP. Researchers at Stanford have shown how the US can provide 100% of its energy with WWS by 2030. [1] Why should the US invest in NP, the more expensive, less efficient, and more harmful energy source? Pro offers no answer to this question. And Pro offers no answer because there isn't one. NP is fraught with unsolvable infrastructural, economic, social, and environmental problems. These problems include immense capital costs, slow deployment, reactor safety issues, waste storage issues, vulnerability to the effects of climate change, weaponization of uranium, vulnerability to terrorist attack, and even reliability issues (since it depends on foreign sources of uranium). WWS is better on every front. -- Urgency Global warming requires quick reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Pro agrees that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced. In fact, Pro's entire argument focuses on impacts from global warming and emission reductions. But Pro doesn't seem to recognize the urgency or scale of the problem. If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [2] The high-albedo Arctic ice is disappearing, and when it does, it'll trigger rapid positive feedbacks to warmer temperatures by uncovering the low-albedo ocean below. Time is of the essence. Emissions need to be reduced very quickly if we are to avoid a planetary ecological catastrophe. It takes about 11-19 years to build a new NP plant. [3] WWS, on the other hand, only takes 2-5 years. That means the US can lower greenhouse gas emissions much faster by investing in WWS instead of NP. This is why it's possible for the US to provide all its energy with WWS by 2030. [1] The same cannot be said about NP. Moreover, because WWS is rolled out more quickly, the cumulative greenhouse gas savings from WWS far outweigh those from NP. [3] As Mark Jacobson, a researcher and professor at Stanford, notes: ""if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables, you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait, and wait, for the nuclear age to arrive. We will also guarantee a riskier future for us all."" [4] These are powerful words. I urge Pro, voters, and anyone else reading this to heed Jacobson's warning. Costs NP is expensive. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says the average cost of electricity produced by a next-generation nuclear plant (which is cheaper than current plants) is $0.1084 per kilowatt-hour (""kWh""). [5] Comparatively, WWS is much cheaper. Solar, which is more expensive than wind or water, is already as low as $0.0508/kWh. [6] That's half the cost of NP. And costs of WWS are decreasing, whereas costs of NP are going up as uranium is depleted. Moreover, EIA's estimate is lower than it should be because it doesn't take into account the costs of building, insuring, and decommissioning plants, as well as storing radioactive waste. Decommission costs $3 billion per plant. [7] Waste management was $96 billion 2008 -- and that cost is ongoing and rising, because nuclear waste keeps building up, and it lasts thousands of years. [8] Finally, there's the costs of cleanup after a meltdown (e.g. costs of Fukushima were estimated at $100 billion). [9] Former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Peter Bradford put it best: ""If asked whether we should increase our reliance on caviar to fight world hunger, most people would laugh. Relying on an overly expensive commodity to perform an essential task spends too much money for too little benefit, while foreclosing more-promising approaches. That is nuclear power's fundamental flaw in the search for plentiful energy without climate repercussions, though reactors are also more dangerous than caviar unless you're a sturgeon."" Bradford continues: ""nuclear power is so much more expensive than alternative ways of providing energy that the world can only increase its nuclear reliance through massive government subsidies like the $8 billion loan guarantee offered by the federal government to a two-reactor project in Georgia approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission earlier this year."" [10] Terrorism The more NP expands, the more opportunities that become available for using (or diverting) nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. These risks must be taken into account. And they're not entirely speculative. Historically, the growth of NP has increased the ability of nations to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. ""The historic link between energy facilities and weapons is evidenced by the development or attempted development of weapons capabilities secretly in nuclear energy facilities in Pakistan, India, Iraq (prior to 1981), Iran, and to some extent North Korea."" In fact, ""one of the factors leading several countries now without nuclear power programs to express interest in nuclear power is the foundation that such programs could give them to develop weapons."" [3] Moreover, NP plants are a major target for terrorists. If a plane were flown into a nuclear plant, the disaster would be immeasurably worse than Chernobyl. 9/11 would be tiny by comparison. Terrorists could also target waste sites, for a similar effect. Reliability Extreme weather, flooding, and storm surge have increasingly made NP unsafe to operate (e.g. three plants were shut down in the wake of Hurricane Sandy). [15] Anticipated effects from global warming will interfere with NP, making NP an unreliable source of power. Moreover, rising seas and flooding don't just create a risk of shutdown, but also a risk of releasing hazardous materials, like what happened at Fukushima. Global warming increases the risk and uncertainty associated with NP. Given the high upfront costs of building new NP plants, and the difficulty of adapting them to climate change, WWS is a better option going forward. WWS sources are decentralized, small, and easier to move, making them more reliable in the case of extreme weather. Meltdowns Should failure occur, the consequences are probably the worst of any high risk activity that humans engage in. There have already been four nuclear accidents: Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. Each accident was unique, and each was supposed to have been impossible. Yet each happened. Failures like these can and will continue to happen. The risks and costs are too high. -- Rebuttal (1) Environment Pro is wrong that NP doesn't produce any greenhouse gas emissions. Vast amounts of fossil fuels are burned to mill, mine, leech, transport, and enrich uranium, and to build and decommission nuclear plants. [3] In fact, many NP plants are nearly as carbon-intensive as a coal plant. [11] For instance, ""in 2002, the Paducah [uranium] enrichment plant [in Kentucky] released over 197.3 metric tons of Freon, [a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide]."" [12] And the emissions produced by NP are only increasing because the deposits of rich ores with the highest uranium content are depleting, leaving only lower-quality deposits. [13] As ore quality degrades, more energy is required to mine and mill it, leading to greater greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, by 2050, NP will produce as much greenhouse gas emissions as today's fossil fuel plants. [14] Compared to WWS, NP results in 25 times more carbon emissions, due to emissions from uranium refining and transport and reactor construction, the longer time required to site, permit, and construct a NP plant, and due to greater loss of soil carbon due to the greater loss in vegetation resulting from covering the ground with NP plants. [3] (2) Re: Pro's C2: All energy needs can be met through WWS. [1] (3) Re: Pro's C3: Addressed above. NP is extremely expensive. If it were cheap, the market would choose NP. The government wouldn't need to subsidize it. But as is, NP requires billions in subsidies per plant. WWS is cheaper. (4)Fusion The US shouldn't subsidize the building of thorium or fusion. There's no indication that thorium or fusion is even possible. To date, no thorium or fusion power exists. And most physicists don't think controlled fusion will ever be possible. [16] [17] We're facing serious problems from global warming, air pollution, and energy instability. The US needs to invest in solutions to these problems before it throws away money on a wild goose chase. The US needs to focus on today's pressing issues, not on building a power plant that might never be built. The urgency of today's problems require that we invest in WWS. That's the first thing we need to do. Investment in fusion may come after we solve today's problems. But first, the US needs to focus on ensuring our species survives a looming catastrophe. -- [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com...

So NASA can easily get MORE technology through trading that private sectors can't. 2. RISK So there is risk. In this instance, greater risk does not come greater reward. Not when there is only one goal, efficient solar power, we need to take the least amount of risk. We both agree in NASA. 3. Funding NASA could easily build and buy infrastructure.

Sf074f877-Aad16e411	Nuclear Power	"The primary intention of my argument, will be to convince the reader that nuclear energy is becoming obsolete. I hope to put nuclear energy in the same category as fossil fuels, and perhaps show that nuclear energies carbon footprint actually has more impact on the environment than oil, coal, and all other fossil fuels. I believe that nuclear energy represents an old standard of large, company owned energy when society is on the cusp of technological advances that will help promote individually owned energy. While energy saving batteries and solar panels become more advanced and cheaper as time moves forward, nuclear energy, and all energy companies may find it increasingly difficult to compete, and will struggle to justify their existence. If we owned the means of our own energy production, then the risks involved with nuclear energy would become unnecessary. Out of all forms of terrorism, nuclear terrorism is on the highest rung of terror. One could argue that steps could be taken to lessen the risk of a terrorist attack on a nulclear plant, but that would raise the price of nuclear energy, and there's never a garuantee. Unfortunately, terrorism is more technologically advanced too. Cyber terrorism can potentially penatrate the safeguards of a nuclear power plant, and destroy lives. The only true garuantee against such a nightmarish scenario would be to abandon nuclear energy, and embrace renewables, embrace the future. Any government investment in a renewable energy based infrastructure could potentially be paid back to the taxpayers in the form of savings on energy costs. Investments in nuclear power would come from the consumers, and may not have the same energy saving bennefit. I will show you that money used to ""update"" nuclear power plants doesn't fall solely on the consumers, but on taxpayers as well. In my oppinion, goverment investment in nulclear energy is nothing more than a bailout, whereas a government investment in renewables, is an investment for the future of energy. *Nulclear is becoming obsolete* The Tesla power wall and other products like it are becoming more of a mainstream option for home energy consumers. More and more renewables are being looked at as a viable option for homeowners and renters. Less and less are renewables being thought of as solely an environmentally conscious decision by the wealthy. Renewables are becoming more efficient and less expensive, and there's no evidence that trend will plateau anytime soon. True, waste annihilating molten salt reactors (wamsr) are a technological advancement for the nuclear industry, but they are not inducive toward individually owned energy. WAMSRs also don't represent a cheaper trending source of energy. Actually, the cost of nuclear energy may go up initially because of the cost of converting old reactors into newer WAMSRs. As time goes on renewables are becoming more of a mainstream option for energy consumers. http://theconversation.com... *Nulclear is not clean energy* High grade uranium is a finite recourse, so nuclear energy is automatically barred from being considered a renewable energy. Nuclear reactors need uranium to function. The uranium minning process is an environmental nightmare. Just like coal minning, uranium minning leaves toxic remnants but the remnants of uranium minning are toxic for hundreds of thousands of years. And of course, just like coal minning, uranium minning needs large heavy machinery to move and process, and then needs to be shipped to the plants. All this moving and processing needs fossil burning fueled truck and machinery. Then there is the spent nuclear rods, and other nuclear waste that has to be isolated for hundreds of thousands of years. WAMSRs can help with using up much of the nuclear waste, but does nothing to lessen the environmentally disruptive minning process, and won't be able to use up all the nuclear waste. When you consider the environmental litigation, the storing of used material, the energy needed to convert nuclear power into energy, (it takes energy for nuclear conversion) then nuclear energy is very inefficient. In my humble opinion along with many in the science community, nuclear energy is the WORST polluter of all energy sources. Most scientists believe, if we stop using fossil fuels today the effects on the environment would begin to reverse in as little as a decade. If we stop using nuclear power today, we will have to deal with the environmental effects for hundreds of thousands of years to come. Don't believe the hype, nuclear energy isn't clean! http://www.beyondnuclear.org... http://www.psr.org... https://www.theguardian.com... *Nulclear power plants are susceptible to terrorism* http://www.cbsnews.com... The fact of the matter is, terrorists don't need old fashioned brute force and guns to gain control of a nuclear power plant. Cyber terrorism is the new technological weapon in the arsenal, and there's far less calorie burning required, much to the chagrin of the lazy terrorist. A skilled computer tech, or a team of techs could potentially infiltrate a nuclear power plant and shut it down, release radioactive material into the air, or even cause a meltdown. But for the nostalgic terrorist, guns and brut force still is an option. *Nuclear power relies on goverment bailouts* The nuclear industry has needed government assistance to help save them from bankruptcy. They also need government assistance for environmental litigation and high insurance costs. http://www.psr.org.... The taxpayers money needed to help the nuclear industry qstay afloat may never be reimbursed to the taxpayers, and there's no assurance that the nuclear industry will stop needing assistance for the foreseeable future because of old outdated and crumbling nuclear plants. http://www.psr.org...

Sefd746e-Aca04c9a3	Nuclear Power VS. Solar Power	To start this debate, I will begin by fabricating a nuclear power plant, and a solar array for comparison purposes. El-Cheapo Nuclear Plant (1,2,3,4) Gross Power Capacity 1500 Megawatts (1443 Sustained 24/7) Capacity Factor 91.2% Cost to build ($5500/kWh*1500000) = $8.5 Billion+$300 Million Decommissioning Fund Life Span 45-60 Years Giga-watts produced per year (1.5 per hour*91.2% capacity factor*24 hours*365 days)=11900gWh Giga-watts produced over plant life span=535,000-714,000 Cost per Mega-watt over lifespan (8,800,000,000/535,000,000)=$16.44 El-Cheapo Solar Plant (2,5,6) Gross Power Capacity 1500 Megawatts Capacity Factor 17% (Average of Massachusetts-(15%) and Arizona-(19%) Capacity Factor) Cost To Build ($.74/watt *1.5 billion watts +50% for installation) 1.665 billion Life Span 20-30 years Giga-watts produced per year(1.5 per hour*17% capacity factor*24 hours*365 days)=2250gWh Giga-watts produced over plant life span=45,000-67,500 Cost Per Megawatt over lifespan (1,665,000,000/45,000,000)=$37 Arguments Cost: A Nuclear Power Plant will cost less than half of a comparable solar power plant per megawatt. Even factoring in fuel, security and maintenance, nuclear power costs about 4 cents per kWh, and solar power costs 22 cents per kWh produced (7). This means that if nuclear power were more widely used, it would cut energy costs for businesses to 18% of what their bills would be if solar power were more widely used. Capacity: It would take more than five el-cheapo solar plants to produce the same average energy as one el-cheapo nuclear plant. Energy is not needed only when the sun is shining, but also at night, meaning that for solar power to be a feasible alternative, dozens of Giga-watt battery arrays would have to be built, further driving up the price of solar energy. Not only that, but what do you do about several cloudy or rainy days in a row? However, a nuclear plant can simply run at full load all night or during cloudy/rainy days. Life Span: A nuclear power plant can be used for twice as long as a solar plant. Why build 2 solar plants over 60 years if you could just build one cheaper, more reliable nuclear plant? Safety record: Events such as Chernobyl and the Fukushima disaster gives nuclear power in the United States a bad name. Nuclear power ranks among the safest industries in America (8), for 2008, the industry hit a new low of 0.13 industrial accidents per 200,000 worker-hours, as compared to 1.3 per 200,000 worker hours in all private industries. I do not wish to get overly technical with reactor safety, but the Fukushima, and Chernobyl reactors were not in the same league of safety as American reactors. The Fukushima reactors had a containment dome capable of withstanding 60psi of internal pressure, whereas United States Reactors can withstand up to 200psi, and the force of a commercial-airliner crashing into them. Also remember the Chernobyl power plants used a ludicrously stupid graphite rod assembly (I would need 20,000 characters to explain why) which caused a reactor meltdown. Also, remember, the Japanese placed their emergency backup generators and pumps below sea level! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission would never approve this system (9,10,11,12) Nuclear Waste: Nuclear Waste could easily be disposed at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which was deemed safe for 1,000,000 years, however it was closed and defunded by the Obama administration for “political, not technical or safety reasons” (13). So the nuclear waste problem can be solved, but Washington refuses to act upon it. Land Use: It would take almost 20 square miles to build a 1500-megawatt solar plant, however a 1500-megawatt nuclear plant only takes 3 square miles. The nuclear plant therefore further reduced environmental ramifications for animals, by disturbing fewer habitats (1,14). I have shown that nuclear power is safe, cheaper than solar power, more durable than solar power, and more feasible than large-scale solar power, good luck to my opponent.

Sf59a1cd-A4d5f2035	Beginner's Tournament, Nuclear Power Plants	Rebuttal Cost: (#1 citation bad link).Inability to review figures provided. Analysis of nuclear power in 2013 for plants operational by 2020 [1] with total system cost associated is 95.2 MWh. But this is the price after tax credits are awarded which is $18/MWh, a production credit. This brings the costs to 113.2 MWh. Due to exorbitant upfront cost of construction and financing for a 1GW plant, the end cost of a 40 yr loan brings construction costs to 17 billion dollars. Even though the cost of nuclear fuel is substantially less expensive than fossil fuels, the upfront cost offsets this; resulting in nuclear power being substantially more expensive [2]. To further the point, in the US and Europe nuclear power plants have received substantial government subsidies [3, 4]. In The US 3.3 billion a year; with close to 330 million people in this country, that amounts to $100 per person/per year in tax dollars for every man woman and child. In the UK these subsides are so contentious they have been eliminated [6. p.17] In Germany, the unprofitability and significant cost of nuclear power has moved this country to phase out nuclear energy altogether by 2020 [7]. 2. Rebuttal Dangers: (After searching the whole site provided, I think have found the correct article you referenced.) Certainly lives matter. But, also this article makes note that from 2004 to 2010 deaths related to conventional power plants are significantly less than before emission control technologies. Latest figures are at 7,500 [8] and more efficient emissions control tech is advancing every day. I do agree coal and gas fired plants are not good but, nuclear power is worse. If we are looking at a death affect, let’s look at the Chernobyl after math. The 830,000 of individuals who worked on the plant to extinguish the fire and cap the plant after the explosion are at a higher risk for leukemia. As of 2005, of these workers, 112,000 to 125,000 have died. Of 6.5 million people in the vicinity, children and teens have a 1 in 31 chance of developing thyroid cancer [9], 6,000 cases confirmed in Ukrainian, Belarus and Russian have been reported up to 2005 alone[10]. Global death toll from fallout from Chernobylas of 2005 is estimated to totaling 985,000. Since1986 healthy birth rates in the area went from 80% to 20%. We are looking at a second generation of after effects. From the Fukushima Daiichi incident, cases of thyroid cancer are beginning to sprout up and are expected to continue for years to come [10] I ask you my respected opponent, do nearly a million lives matter? Though the ratio to number of plants in years of operation to accidents appears low, and there seems to be an assumption that they are relatively safe. But, when an accident does occur the results are devastating. It affects human lives, land and animals for decades into the future. It is not worth the risk. If a fire occurs at a natural gas or coal facility its impacts are very local, affecting fewer lives with no long term human or environmental affects. A: “Clean: Nuclear fuels are technically infinite and it does not produce harmful gases into the atmosphere we live in.”( #3, 4 & 5 citations bad links) Though I could not view your sources, but let’s examine the environmental harmful gases produced. A nuclear plant while in operation has a near zero carbon emissions. What is involved in the life cycle of a nuclear power plant, construction, mining uranium, processing and transportation of radioactive bi-products and decommissioning of plants all has a carbon footprint associated. Nuclear power plant life cycle in emissions is at 66 gCO2e/kWh, which is lower than coal and natural gas. Although, nuclear power does throw off 2x as much in carbon in the form of solar photovoltaic at 32 gCO2e/kW. Wind farms off shore are only at 10 gCO2e/kWh [12]. With the extraordinary high cost of construction over alternative energies, even here the carbon footprint can be smaller. Yes, there is ample uranium, estimated to be about 250 years worth. But, uranium mining is hazardous to health. It is mostly done in open pit mines. Miners often suffer from lung cancer after breathing in uranium tailings. Mining activities contaminate the water table which has caused cancer in indigenous populations [13]; death and more death. For the purpose of this debate I’m not required to prove that fossil fuels are bad or to suggest an alternative source of energy. I need only to prove that Nuclear Power plants are bad per my opening statement. http://www.eia.gov... http://large.stanford.edu... http://www.economist.com... http://www.ucsusa.org... http://cen.acs.org... https://www.gov.uk... http://www.dw.com... http://www.catf.us... http://www.cancer.gov... http://www.theguardian.com... http://www.ens-newswire.com... http://www.nature.com... 13. http://ieer.org...

Sefd746e-A873fbd94	Nuclear Power VS. Solar Power	Let me start my arguments. These days people and industry are interested in creating a new energy source which is not only friendly for the environment but can produce enough power to sustain homes and businesses. There are number of benefits of solar power. First is that it is cleaner. ``Producing solar energy doesn`t require the buring of fossile fuels, currently the most common sources of energy in the United States.``(http://www.livestrong.com...) This is a result of research by the U.S.Department of Energy. The important thing is that buring fossile fuels contributes to releasesing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, ``producing electlicity with solar technology releases no such gases`` which is harmful for the environment and human beings. (http://www.livestrong.com...) Second is that solar power is renewable. ``The World Coal Institute estimates that there is enough coal to last more than 130 years at current production levels, enough oil to last 42 years and enough gas for 60 years. The sun, however, is an inexhaustible energy source, and from it solar technology can produce unlimited amounts of energy.``(http://www.livestrong.com...) Third is that solar power contributes to reducing oil imported from the oil producing countries. For example, ``the United States imports more than 50 percent of the oil it uses, and spends more than 20 billion dollars each year on oil from the Middle East.``( http://www. livestrong.com) Fourth is that solar power is beneficial for human health. The important thing is that ``solar energy provides an essential vitamin for the human body, vitamin D. With the influx of articifial lighting and in-home technology, many Americans are not getting enough exposure to the sun.``( http://www.livestrong.com...) Therefore, ``natural absorption of vitamin D comes from the sun`s ultraviolet rays, and solar energy - especially in sun rooms or sky lights - is an abundant and effective source.``(http://www.livestrong.com...) That are all my arguments for Round 2. I continue on my arguments for Round 3. Good Luck.	CON	253

A lawyer's moral duty to his client, requires him to uphold the client's confidentiality even if that client were to confess to a crime. If that client confessed to someone who did not have this duty of confidentiality to him, however, it would not be wrong of this third party to report the confession to the police. A parent, in virtue of their special relationship to their child, has moral responsibilities to their child that they do not have for other children. It seems wrong for a parent who had the time to skip their child's graduation or to fail to help their child with homework. It would not be wrong, however, for a parent do abstain from attending the graduation of a random child or to not help that random child with homework. In a similar vein to these cases, governments have special duties of care to their own citizens, both because citizens contribute to their societies in unique ways (they pay taxes, they vote, they serve on juries, etc), which entails reciprocal obligations from the state to pay citizens back for these contributions, but also because of the more ephemeral sociocultural and moral connections that people share with their countries. It is important also to note that, in each of these three cases, failing to recognize the validity of these special obligations is highly problematic. Without attorney client privilege, the right to due process would be infringed; if parents had equal obligations to all children, (a) parents could never devote sufficient time to their own child and (b) virtually all parents living today would be immoral by that standard, which is obviously preposterous; and, if government's had equal obligations to all people, (a) they could never devote sufficient resources to their own citizens and (b) governments would not be repaying citizens for the services they contributed to and contracted for.

These are toxic for hundreds of thousands of years...Contamination of local water supplies around uranium mines and processing plants has been documented in Brazil, Colorado, Texas, Australia, Namibia and many other sites...These tailings contain uranium, thorium, radium, polonium, and emit radon-222."" [3] III. Health Risks A. Meltdowns ""Once a large amount of radioactive cesium enters an ecosystem, it quickly becomes ubiquitous, contaminating water, soil, plants and animals. It has been detected in a large range of Japanese foodstuffs, including spinach, tea leaves, milk, beef, and freshwater fish up to 200 miles from Fukushima...Routine ingestion of foods contaminated with so-called 'low levels' of radioactive cesium has been shown to lead to its bioaccumulation in the heart and"" other organs. ""This process occurs much faster in children than in adults."" [1] The evidence I cited earlier regarding Chernobyl also presents a case for how the disaster there may have poisoned certain foodstuffs for years to come. ""Damage caused by the Chernobyl disaster is estimated at some $235 billion...2 million people...suffered from its consequences"" and 1.3 million still live in contaminated areas. ""Medical effects of the disaster saw a dramatic growth of cancer...Among children, thyroid cancer incidence went [up] 40 times since the explosion, [and was up] 2.5 to 7 times among adults."" [4] B. Uranium Mining ""Uranium miners experience higher rates of lung cancer, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. The production of 1,000 tons of uranium fuel generates approximately 100,000 tons of radioactive tailings and nearly one million gallons of liquid waste containing heavy metals and arsenic in addition to radioactivity. These uranium tailings have contaminated rivers and lakes."" [5] C . Proximity and Plant Safety ""Even when reactors operate normally, statistically significant increases in infant and fetal mortality near US reactors, in childhood leukemia near German reactors, and in cancer near UK reactors, suggest that (even without any accidents) those living near reactors could face higher health risks."" [6] ""More than 75 percent of the nation's nuclear plants have reported a radioactive leak in their lifetimes...They've also suffered explosions, fires and corrosion."" [7] ""Leaks from at least 37 of those facilities contained concentrations exceeding the federal drinking water standard--sometimes at hundreds of times the limit...[R]egulators...have weakened safety standards for decades to keep the nation's commercial nuclear reactors operating within the rules."" [8] The problems with regulators are unlikely to abate if nuclear power continues to be used; namely because regulators may feel pressure from governments to keep the plants up-and-running, particularly if the governments have not invested in alternative sources of energy. IV. Violence A. Proliferation The presence of nuclear plants could tempt irresponsible countries or those facing external threats to use the plants to produce weapons-grade material. The more nuclear weapons, the greater the risk that one would be accidentally launched, stolen, or fired, leading to a less safe world situation. Precedent for this exists: ""Expanded use of nuclear power would increase the risk that commercial nuclear technology will be used to construct clandestine weapons facilities, as was done by Pakistan."" [5] B. Cyberterror/Cyberattacks ""Nuclear power plants may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, which might...lead to substantial releases of radioactive material with consequent loss of lives, radiation sickness and psycho-trauma, extensive property destruction and economic upheaval."" [9] Precedent for this kind of attack also exists. The US-Israeli Stuxnet Virus, for example, was used against Iran, causing ""roughly a fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges"" to ""spin out of control."" [10] This kind of threat is particularly dangerous, because it could come from a lone wolf or terror group, but also from a highly sophisticated state actor, as was the case in Stuxnet. C. Terrorism In 2007, gunmen managed to gain access to the control room of South Africa's Pelindaba Nuclear Plant--an attack so well executed many felt it had insider assistance. [11] In 2002, al-Qaeda was found to have diagrams of American nuclear power plants. [12] In 2016, the Brussels bombers appeared to have tailed the head of Belgium's nuclear program in the hopes of abducting him and using him to gain access to a nuclear facility. [13] Terrorists have looked into strikes on nuclear reactors, and it may only be a matter of time before an attack occurs. Terrorist attacks could involve triggering a meltdown at a power plant or stealing radioactive material from a plant, a fuel reprocessing facility, on route to a disposal location. Terrorists could steal material for a bomb, trigger a meltdown, aerosolize and disperse nuclear material, or use nuclear material to contaminate soil or water. ""Unlike accidents, which occur at random, terrorists carefully choose the site of their attacks...choosing weather conditions that would maximize the impacts on an attack."" The effects of an attack on the spent fuel ""at a pressurized water reactor [could] be 54,000 to 143,000 extra cancer deaths; 2,000 to 7,000 square kilometers of agricultural land condemned; and economic costs of $117 to $556 billion from evacuation."" Such an attack could release up to 17.5x more cesium than Chernobyl. [14] D. War Nuclear plants have been targeted in military conflicts. [15] Plants put nearby civilians in conflict zones in danger from attacks and meltdowns. V. Costs Advanced nuclear power costs more per megawatt hour than a variety of fossil fuels as well as various clean energy sources like geothermal, hydroelectric, and wind. [16] ""The [UK's] energy department shows that it expects onshore wind power and large-scale solar to cost around £50-75 per megawatt hour...in 2025. New nuclear is anticipated to be around £85-125 per MWh"" by that time."" [17] As green tech develops, we can also expect innovations and greater competition to drive down prices further. VI.

Sf1a21dd4-A5ba2482d	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"Thank you for the opportunity to join you in this debate; currently I am debating this in school. Contention I: Problem A: Pollution leads to Global Warming Carbon dioxide and other air pollution that is collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Coal-burning power plants are the largest U.S. source of carbon dioxide pollution -- they produce 2.5 billion tons every year. Automobiles, the second largest source, create nearly 1.5 billion tons of CO2 annually.(1) A study by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found that ignoring global warming would end up costing $20 trillion by 2100. (2) 150,000: Number of people the World Health Organization estimates are killed by climate-change-related issues every year (3) In April, a group of 11 former U.S. military leaders released a report charging that the war in Somalia during the 1990s stemmed in part from national resource shortages caused by global warming. (4) Problem B: Dependence on Gasoline It is no coincidence that so much of the cash filling terrorists' coffers come from the oil monarchies in the Persian Gulf. It is also no coincidence that those countries holding the world's largest oil reserves and those generating most of their income from oil exports, are also those with the strongest support for radical Islam. In fact, oil and terrorism are entangled. If not for the West's oil money, most Gulf states would not have had the wealth that allowed them to invest so much in arms procurement and sponsor terrorists organizations.. But the only way to deal with the problem strategically is to reduce the disposable income and wealth generation capacity of terrorist supporters. Hence, America's best weapon against terrorism is to decrease its dependency on foreign oil by increasing its fuel efficiency and introducing next-generation fuels. Only then financial support for terrorism could radically diminish. (5) Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem have once again illustrated dramatically that the international community failed,to understand the magnitude and implications of the terrorist threats to the very survival of civilization itself. Contemporary terrorists have introduced a new scale of violence in terms of conventional and unconventional threats and impact. The internationalization and brutalization of current and future terrorism make it clear we have entered an Age of Super Terrorism with its serious implications concerning national, regional and global security concerns.(6) Problem C: Peak oil is upon us We are fast approaching a critical watershed for the fossil-fuel era, with potentially dire consequences for industrial civilization. Experts had been saying that we had another forty or so years of cheap available crude oil left. Now, however, some of the world's leading petroleum geologists are suggesting that global oil production could peak and begin a steep decline much sooner, as early as the second decade of the 21st century. Non-OPEC oil producing countries are already nearing their peak production, leaving most of the remaining reserves in the politically unstable Middle East. Increasing tensions between Islam and the West are likely to further threaten our access to affordable oil. In desperation, the U.S. and other nations could turn to dirtier fossil-fuels – coal, tar sand, and heavy oil – which will only worsen global warming and imperil the earth's already beleaguered ecosystems. Looming oil shortages make industrial life vulnerable to massive disruptions and possibly even collapse. (7) The decline of oil, the principal driver of economic growth, undermines the validity of that collateral which in turn erodes the valuation of most entities quoted on Stock Exchanges. The investment community however faces a dilemma. It desires to protect its own fortunes and those of its privileged clients while at the same time is reluctant to take action that might itself trigger the meltdown. It is a closely knit community so that it is hard for one to move without the others becoming aware of his actions. In this situation, interest shifts to commodities and to short term trading to benefit from daily or hourly fluctuations in price, implying that there are few valid genuine long-term investments left. The scene is set for the Second Great Depression. (8) Contention II: Currently the government is not going far enough to encourage alternative energy Mandate: A 7% tax break would go to businesses switching to Jatropha bean alternative energy Logistics: Recycle Government Waste Intent: ""We reserve the right to explain what we mean"" Contention III: Our plan would increase alternative energy use, halt Global warming, and reduce the risk of nuclear annihilation. Biofuels can slash global warming pollution. By 2050, biofuels could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 1.7 billion tons per year. That's equal to more than 80 percent of current transportation-related emissions.(9) Producing a cheap and reliable alternative to oil will be lucrative business, but industry needs encouragement to develop technologies that are also sustainable and environmentally sound. The government can spur the development along through strategic investments and incentive programs. (10) Jatropha Statistics (11): Jatropha is seen by many to be the perfect biodiesel crop. It can be grown in very poor soils actually generating top soil as it goes, is drought and pest resilient, and it has seeds with up to 40% oil content. - Jatropha grows well on low fertility soils - Jatropha can be intercropped with many cash crops such as coffee, sugar, fruits and vegetables with the Jatropha offering both fertilizer and protection against livestock. - Jatropha can survive three years of drought by dropping its leaves. - Jatropha is excellent at preventing soil erosion, and the leaves it drops act as a wonderful soil enriching mulch. - The cost of 1000 jatropha saplings (enough for one acre) in Pakistan is around 5000PKR (equiv to around ï¿½50 or just 5p each). - 80% of seedlings planted will survive. - Jatropha seedlings yield seeds in the first year after plantation. - After the first five years, the typical annual yield of a jatropha tree is 3.5kg of beans. - Jatropha trees are productive for up to 30-40 years. - 2,200 trees can be planted per hectare (approx 1,000 per acre). - 1 hectare should yield around 7 tonnes of seeds per year. - 91%+ of the oil can be extracted with cold pressing. - 1 hectare should yield around 2.2-2.7 tonnes of oil. - Filtered jatropha oil can be used as is in many diesel vehicles I still have info to put in! I'm starting to hate the 8,000 character limit! Yet again, I'd like to thank my opponent for the chance to debate him, and I wish him the best of luck in his rebuttal.

Sf59a1cd-A5fb9df43	Beginner's Tournament, Nuclear Power Plants	Before I conclude the debate, let's begin with a few rebuttals: 1.Renewables: Our opponent has exaggerated the usefulness of energy storage.One of the most powerful energy storage projects today is projected to story 10.8MW of power[1], but this is just 0.05% of the world's total electricity consumption[2].So dear opponent, is your solution to the instability of renewable energy feasible? 2.Radioactivity: Our opponent has stated that the spills of the nuclear fallout bring long term effect to the residents there. But did our opponent consider that coal-fired power plants ALSO gives out radioactivity that is higher than the nuclear fallout?Coal ash, which accounts for 18 millirems, is higher than nuclear's one, which is 3-6 milirems[3].These coal ash poisons the water, kill fish and wildlife[4] and affects anybody residing nearby.Does my opponent considered the people living near coal power plants? 3.Safety: Our opponent has disregarded the good effects that nuclear power brings. As mentioned in the previous rounds, nuclear power improves our world by emitting no greenhouse gas and gas that are harmful to us.Should we disregard the good that nuclear brings by a single accident?Also, there are plans in USA, Finland, France, the UK to build more reactors and the proposed ones count for more than 300 reactors[5].These countries still build nuclear reactors after the accident you mentioned.These countries still build reactors because they know what these reactors will bring to their environment.Doesn't these counts?Also, according to the Nuclear Power Institute, nuclear power has met with one-third of the electricity consumption the world uses, but just produces the minimal waste compared to the fossil fuel powered generators. The total volume of nuclear waste produced since the nuclear power industry began is only enough to fill a football field to a depth of about 15 yards[6]. Thus, we can see that nuclear power is the best option. 4.Cost: Also according to the research you rebuttal last turn[7], we can see that the trend of coal-power power plants rises quick, but the nuclear one remained. The trend offsets the $3.3 billion you have mentioned above.Also, there are a $500 billion subsidies for coal powered plants[8].So, after factoring on these resources, I firmly believe that nuclear power is cheaper than coal-powered plants. Nuclear energy is safe, stable and superior. To conclude the debate, nuclear energy is safe, stable and superior.Nuclear power plants do not release harmful gas into the atmosphere, as said in the first round, and also do not release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Using nuclear energy will give a better environment for our descendants. Also, as said in the second round, fossil-fuel powered power plants gives out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and renewable energy is too unstable to be used. Does our opponent want to give a smoggy, uninhabitable planet to our descendant and gives the problem to them, or giving them a planet that is powered on sporadically? Our opponent has not answered us that there are feasible plans to replace nuclear energy. Since the opponent cannot give us any, we can see that my opponent had based his reasoning on imaginary grounds.We can also see that there is no other alternatives from nuclear one as my opponent have not given me any alternatives that are better than nuclear energy.Thus, nuclear energy is better than any of every alternative, that is, nuclear energy is good and this motion must stand. Nuclear energy is safe, stable and superior.This motion must stand.Thank you! [1]:http://cleantechnica.com... [2]:http://www.iea.org... [3]:http://www.scientificamerican.com...

Sf074f877-Aa988996b	Nuclear Power	"Breeder reactors are nothing new! My opponents gleaming description of fast breeder reactors gives the reader a sense that breeder reactors are the great white hope for the nuclear industry. Finally, the problem of nuclear waste can be solved. Whoa whoa, don't break out the champagne just yet. Fast breeder reactors are nothing new, they've been around since the dawn of nuclear power. The breeder reactor was created by Leo Zhilard in 1943, and anyone who knows that name, knows that Dr Zhilard worked on the Manhattan project. Breeder reactors are nothing new, and there are reasons they haven't been in wide use commercially since their inception. This technology has proven to be insanely expensive to create, and breeder reactors are known for being unreliable. One might get the idea that these reactors can just start eating up spent nuclear waste material like a hungry hippo and that's the end of that, but the truth is breeder reactors still need a reliable source of uranium. Also, the nulclear waste these reactors can allegedly clean up, needs further processing before it's reactor ready, and that's an industrial sized operation, and also leaves a radioactive salt residue that will need to be stored. If we look at plutonium as a commercial commodity, plutonium costs are known to swing wildly because of processing costs, and ever changing global policy on storing, procesing, and shipping. Experiment breeder reactors have never been able to reach their intended goals of output because of plutonium cost. Also there are fears of shipping the plutonium, because those shipments could be sought after by terrorists, or could be invoved in an accident, which could cause an environmental catastrophe. There are a number countries that are in persuitt of developing this technology, but many scientists around the world point out that Germany and France have tried this technology in the seventees and they did not have gleaming results. http://thebulletin.org... http://www.japantimes.co.jp... http://thebulletin.org... Nulclear reactors take to long to build. My opponent claims nuclear power is the most effective way to reduce global warming. He points to the year 2050 as the point of no return. https://www.google.com.... Page 9 of this report shows, the US National Commission of Energy estimates the US would need to build 300 to 400 new reactors in the next 30 to 40 years for the US to become carbon free. Nuclear reactors can take up to 10 years to build and have taken far longer, and no country has the ability to build that many reactors in that short of a time frame. I'm sorry, but nuclear power is not a viable option for reducing green house emissions to a safe level by 2050. Furthermore, I do concede that solar and wind farms produce less energy than nuclear, because that is the old outdated standard of renewables, and they need to rely heavily on fossil fuels. The new standard of homeowner solar or wind, combined with energy storing batteries is becoming more efficient and less expensive and will not need to rely on fossil fuel backups. Energy storing batteries may not be able to store enough energy yet, but I wonder what this debate will be like 5 or even 10 years from now. We must realize there are so many companies working toward the goal of ""off the grid"" energy production that by a simple calculation of reason, renewable energy will continue to advance rapidly and will easily meet the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 2050. http://www.theverge.com.... Here's another renewable technology coming to fruition. Are you prepared for nuclear terrorism? My opponents (and all of societies) near complacent attitude toward nuclear terrorism is frightening. Harvard University concluded that there are so many organizations working toward the same goal of nuclear terrorism that we have to expect that a nuclear terrorist attack WILL occur in a western nation eventually. Even more alarming is that same report said that we cannot rule out the possibility of a terrorist organization building an improvised weapon that could be as destructive as the Hiroshima bomb! A US and Russian joint report said that once a terrorist organization is able to obtain the components needed, it would only take a few skilled technicians to build an improvised nuclear weapon. http://news.harvard.edu... https://www.google.com... Inside job!!!! My opponent brings up the fact that nuclear technicians and anybody who has access to a nuclear power plant goes through a stringent background check and psychological examination, however he showed no evidence of that. I pointed out that an airliner packed with passengers went missing, and it's believed the pilot purpously downed the plane. I should point out that pilots go through a stringent background check, and psychological check as well, but that's not a fix all solution by any means. Furthermore, there are no global governing laws on nuclear plant vetting procedures, and even if there were, these procedures could certainly not be enforced in countries that are unfriendly to western countries. A terrorist organization could concievably get what they need in another country to inflict the harm in our country. Nuclear relies on goverment bailouts!!! Government investment in renewables are a measure of implementing new technology and making it more available to the public. Government investments in nulclear energy, is to save nuclear energy companies from failing. I understand renewable energy relies on goverment money to help bring their products to the masses, and to help further develop promising technologies. Renewable energy is on the cutting edge of advancement, whereas nuclear energy has nothing more to offer. There is no ""new"" reactor prototype. Waste annihilators and fast breeders have been around since the inception of the industry. I will answer my opponents question ""why are bailouts necessarily bad?"" In my oppinion, if taxes are taken from someone who does not rely on nuclear power, and used to help stabilize nuclear energy costs, it's not fair to that taxpayer, and it's not ethical. Furthermore, if taxes are taken from someone who does rely on nuclear power, then they're paying twice. That's not really cost stabilization. If tax dollars are taken from taxpayers to invest in a new technology (renewables) that will eventually be paid back to said taxpayers in the form of lower energy costs, then that's a smart government investment. The renewable industry will eventually be self reliant and prove to be more cost effective, the nuclear industry has never been capable of that.http://www.psr.org..."	PRO	257
S1ff2ec96-A93ca69fc	The united states federal government should offer tax incentives for offshore wind turbines	"I support long term extentions of tax credits ""The federal renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) is a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for electricity generated by qualified energy resources and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year. 2.3""/kWh for wind, geothermal, closed-loop biomass; 1.1""/kWh for other eligible technologies. Generally applies to first 10 years of operation. ""(5) contention 1 is inherency, at our current state, we have not extended ptc(production tax credits) that incentivizes the creation wind farms in general. Wind energy in general is a rapidly growing industry that needs the US federal government support in order to expand. On the East coast of the US, offshore wind can create around 4200 GW of wind energy capacity (4).(3). logically, probably less then half of that potential can be tapped but it can still therefore solve for a lot of US energy needs at 1100 mw capacity. contention 2 is global warming- It's well established by the global scientific community that global warming is real and caused by humans.(2) Wind turbines won't burn fossil fuels like other sources of energy like coal and gas which release co2 into our atmostphere causing global warming. Wind turbines capture wind and create electricity and therefore do not pollute the air. Global warming is destroying our world and climate. America is a global leader and if we take increased initiative and incentivize offshore wind power, other nations will follow. More industrialized nations like Germany and Britian are already taking initiative and to prevent global warming, we must attempt to solve. The US pumps out around 20% of the global co2 emission, stopping US emissions is a critical step and offshore wind can be a vehicle to eliminate our carbon footprint. Electricity is around 26% of all co2 emissions on this plant and industry accounts for another 19%. eliminating 26% of global emissions is something we must take to halt our emissions as well as connecting industry to the grid to reduce their emission rates and slow down global warming. Global warming by 2100 is going to increase from 6-8 degrees celsius according to most estimates(12). Global warming leads to ocean acidification, ecology harm, crop failures, severe weather and drought, and other major problems. IT MUST BE STOPPED!!(13) contention 3 is jobs This expanding industry will increase the number of Jobs in electricity industry. Spur jobs created in making turbines, the infrastructure in the turbines, scientists and engineers who explore and design these turbines, and creating maintenance crews. Jobs are vital for our economy. Global warming is killing our ecosystems and therefore vital aspects to our economy like fishing and farming so solving for global warming also benefits our economy. Job creation is great for our economy and yes it will trade off with oil and gas jobs and will spend US tax revenue doing so, but gas and oil jobs already use US government subsidies from $10-50 billion so the Federal Government won't really miss a thing(8). Offshore wind will create more jobs than offshore drilling and electricity.(9) If it's cool, i'm adding a new contention: ocean biodiversity. Sea creatures can live off the side of these offshore wind turbines. It has been empiraically found that having offshore wind turbines has increased the biodiversity and concentration of sea animals. Biodiversity is good because the more biodiverse an area, the less likely the ecosystem is going to become extinct.(14) by helping areas recover from areas damaged by oil spills and drilling. Biodiversity is key to ecosystems and the biosphere. Climate change causes destrution of habitats which reduces biodiversity. Biodiversity is key to reducing co2 emissions. reduction in the capture of co2 causes more climate change. It's a coproductive cycle that keeps insensifying.[15] (1)http://www.ucsusa.org...

S78068d61-A7887a2b	Nuclear power should be banned	"~ WASTE ~ Waste for SOLAR: Solar panels contain some of the most toxic metals in the business of electricity generation. [1] These modules last about 20 years so when you throw them out you are throwing out potentially toxic waste into the environment. [1] Waste from WIND: Other then the mining involved, the wastes for wind are another story: Money. [2] further more wind power can only power 500 homes per turbine on average. [3] So it is efficient and costly. Nuclear is one of the most efficient power sources. [4] Wastes from GEOTHERMAL: Actually geothermal has some radioactive waste products and emits many poisons gases into the air. [5] Wastes from HYDROELECTRIC: There is a lot of investment needed in hydroelectric costs and evaporate the water and displace local fish populations, and kill others. [6] So, all of his nothing statements are FALSE. ""Nuclear wastes are neither particularly hazardous nor hard to manage relative to other toxic industrial wastes."" [7] ""The amount of radioactive wastes is very small relative to wastes produced by fossil fuel electricity generation. "" [7] ""Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product. "" [7] Really if waste is the main issue, then most electric industries should be banned, solar, and fossil fuels. If this is a major reason then we might as well say bye to all energy types. Now my opponent wants to ban coal?!?! Coal is a needed ingredient for steel making. [8] Still: If waste is an issue all fossil fuels and solar energies should be banned too. Your reasoning is very circular. Then my opponent talks about mercury. Actually it has lead and other metals that are linked to kidney and lung damage. [9] Solar panels are the FUTURE of toxic waste. Once again if waste is a problem then almost all energy types should be banned. This argument is all fallacious and has very circular reasoning. He drops all of my argument regarding SAFE waste disposal, regulations making it safe, and NRC and EPA checks making it safe. Actually the imports from china Solar cells hurt the US solar company's. [10] I found a whole bunch of economists on my side. Challenge accepted. ~Weapons! YAY! wait...~ SPLITTING THE ATOM!!!!! MY opponent basically conceded here. Nuclear plants create nuclear fission which is where we let the atoms decay releasing photons and neutrons. [11] In that case, nuclear power has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, therefore you have basically unknowingly conceded. What you are referring to is known as a dirty bomb. [12] It is pop a grenade off goes the nuclear plant! The only way you can do this is if a crazy gets into the plant, there are many regulations, laws, and training that prevent this. [12] Also you then claim the plant can go boom like bomb, false. There are many barriers inside and outside of plants preventing these radiation leaks. [13] Also: Q. Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear weapon? A. "" Absolutely not. A nuclear explosion is impossible in a commercial nuclear power plant. A power plant doesnâ€™t contain the type of fuel in the amount which is needed to make atomic bombs."" [13] Your argument about weaponize is utterly false. Drops my enrichment argument. ~jobs!~ I seriously think your reasoning is well, a fallacy. Banning the power would mean thousands of people out of a job, and you try to claim it is ok. How? If they are fired they will not instantly get a job again! This reasoning is utterly false. Nuclear power has created new 15,000 jobs in only a few years, and solar only 7000. [14, 15] Nuclear power increases state economic worth and creates more revenues. [14] Even if other energies are better (name one in job creation), Nuclear still deserves to stay, and in my opinion your arguments are all just ""I'm scared, so is Greenpeace, lets ban it"" which is kind of a poor argument. ~cost~ Um... OK he wants megawatts XD Nuclear in the US costs 67 cents per MWH. [16] On the table its the cheapest one except its tied with geothermal and barely over wind. Need I say more? (dang sources take up all the room... have to be brief). ~Safety~ Lol time for 3 miller! The amount of radiation exposure to people was so small it was harmless. [17] It gave less radiation exposure then an X-ray. [17] ""There were no injuries or adverse health effects from the Three Mile Island accident. "" [18] No accidents, little exposure, it must have been contained to only have this minor effects. He drops the majority of my round 2 case on the subject. ~Green~ Emitting less pollutants is needed for a green energy! Preventing climate change is needed for being green. As I stated above Nuclear is actually very efficient (see above). My opponent claims I ignore the radiation. No I have not. I have stated many times how the workers keep it contained, have blocks preventing radiation leaks, and have proven many times that nuclear is safe. Also, you have cited no other single alternatives! Also, alternatives constitute a ban? If so then that is absurd! Macs in many peoples eyes are alternatives to PC's, wanna ban PC's? No. Wanna ban Macs because PC's may be alternatives? NO. The point is having alternatives doesn't constitute a ban, and I have proven the arguments of ""crap radiation!"" are false, and well fallacies. All of the arguments presented are circular as you have provided no reasons they are not green except for waste, I refuted this with great facts and you totally act like its not there and claim it is still dangerous.

Sf307b5ea-Aba8a2f0f	HYDROGEN IS THE ANSWER TO OUR ENERGY FUTURE	Yes, I've noticed you've been putting your attention elsewhere. I wouldn't waste any breath on Chavez or the Saudis. Chavez has let power go to his head and seems now to be just another South American banana republic dictator (though with oil). The Saudis are much the same. With their trillions, they could have changed their country from a desert to a cacti-forest; but no, they though it better to own jets, yachts, and a merc for every day of the week. So their (immense) number of princes will inherit desert and dead vehicles instead. THE DEBATE... I can't see hydrogen playing a big part in powering cars. Yes we can have 110% efficient steam-based electrolysis, and then burn it in a car at perhaps 15% efficiency. Compare this to 100% electricity charging a capacitor at 95% efficiency and running the car at 85% efficiency. The compressing, transportation and infrastructure need for hydrogen all make it even less attractive. The transmission infrastructure for electricity is far more efficient, and we already have batteries that allow a sports-car to compete in the current market, and things are only going to get better: http://blog.wired.com... Our future energy needs are likely to be met via improvements and expansion in: * Nuclear power * Photovoltaics * Solar-powered water heating (saved us >1/3rd of our electricity last year) * Energy efficiency * Algae-based oil production * Wind power and others - those are some of the answers to our energy future.

Sf4c49f83-Aa377a1b5	Nuclear power is beneficial for society	I am rather surprised that my opponent has forfeited this round whether on purpose or by accident. My third point to support nuclear power is that nuclear power can be used the provide power everywhere. Hydro only works for places that are near water and most alternative energies often require the country to be resource rich. However, in the world, many places are not resource rich and so must spend money on fossil fuels that are burned releasing C02 into the atmosphere. Nuclear power only requires the purchase of uranium which is rather cheap and the money needed to build a plant. After the plant has been made, power can be generated from the plant at a very low cost. Developing nations need this type of energy to support their growing economies and higher population while trying very hard not to release too much CO2 into the environment. Nuclear is the answer. I hope my opponent posts a third and fourth round, or this debate would feel like a real waste. The reason being that I am very comfortable with this topic and wanted a really good debate. But alas, this seems not to be so.	PRO	262
S3af9364a-A19329190	Nuclear Power is the most viable substitute from fossil fuels	Thank you for this debate, I believe very strongly what I am about to say, and this is an issue that needs to be hammered out to get to the real problems. I am going to argue for the alternative energy source known as geothermal energy. It is obvious that fossil fuels are finite, and we as humans need to be responsible in creating a safe, reliable, and (if possible) limitless energy. Thank goodness there is such a resource. Why geothermal energy? 1) Geothermal energy is inexpensive and easy to obtain. My opponent makes the claim that GE can only be obtained in places where sufficient warmth is available. What he doesn't say is that place is EVERYWHERE. The US being the best country to take advantage of this(1). However, no matter where you are in the world, you can dig a hole. There are better areas than others to dig, of course, but the process to gain the energy is extremely cheap because all you need to do is make generators similar to those in nuclear power plants to get the steam. This means that we can peacefully extract resources in our own country without sending troops to other countries to extract oil in the Middle East. 2) Geothermal energy is virtually limitless. The Earth's core holds around 8,000 zeta joules of energy ripe for the taking. It takes .5 zeta joules of energy to power the rest of the world for eternity. Tapping into this beast of an energy supply is obviously in our benefit. Why not use our planets most powerful energy creating resource into our hands? Why not Nuclear Energy? 1) Nuclear energy is dangerous to obtain. The mining of uranium, as well as its refining and enrichment, and the production of plutonium produce radioactive isotopes that contaminate the surrounding area, including the groundwater, air, land, plants, and equipment. As a result, humans and the entire ecosystem are adversely and profoundly affected. Some of these radioactive isotopes are extraordinarily long-lived, remaining toxic for hundreds of thousands of years. Presently, we are only beginning to observe and experience the consequences of producing nuclear energy. If our goal is to preserve the environment and protect our future on Earth, then this seems like one of the worst ways to do it. 2) We cannot share nuclear energy technology other countries for risk of nuclear proliferation. Nuclear energy relies on the fact that some elements can be split (in a process called fission) and will release part of their energy as heat. Because it fissions easily, Uranium-235 (U-235) is one of the elements most commonly used to produce nuclear energy. It is generally used in a mixture with Uranium-238, and produces Plutonium-239 (Pu-239) as waste in the process. The technology for producing nuclear energy that is shared among nations, particularly the process that turns raw uranium into lowly-enriched uranium, can also be used to produce highly-enriched, weapons-grade uranium. We do not and cannot share this information with many nations because it is a great risk to security. This problem is completely absent in the drive for geothermal energy. In conclusion, we may need alternative sources of energy, but nuclear energy is not the way to obtain it. Geothermal energy is plentiful, cheap, and safe to get. Thank you 1-http://www.ucsusa.org...

S7785529c-Ab340f42e	Abundant wind energy can displace fossil fuels and slash emissions	"A study by the Irish national grid stated that ""Producing electricity from wind reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and therefore leads to emissions savings"", and found reductions in CO2 emissions ranging from 0.33 to 0.59 tonnes of CO2 per MWh.["	PRO	264
Sdd09931a-Ae344a3db	Resolved: The United States should Significantly Increase its Use of Nuclear Energy	"I want to thank Con for proposing this debate. I am accepting this debate so that we may all educate ourselves, as I am not an expert on the subject, and the question interested me. I will try to research each point to the best of my ability, and hopefully the best choice for America will be exposed in this debate. First of all let me point out that nuclear power is only one peice of the puzzle for ""new energy"" sources. My arguments will look at the bigger picture, but specifically this very essential piece of the puzzle. Contention One: Nuclear power plants to not emit carbon dioxide. Because of this simple fact it is easy to speculate why nuclear energy use went up, but CO2 emissions did not go down. Second, it is important to note that my opponent's statistics are not coincidental. The biggest rise in carbon emissions in Japan have been from 1990-2008. Household carbon emissions posted the highest gains with a 40% increase. Officials attribute this rise to the fact that now more Japanese own household appliances, and more Japanese drive cars than they did between 1965-1990. Looking to more recent data, however, Japan has reduced emissions by 1.2million tons (2006-2007). A study was made of the Japanese energy system using the MARKAL model to determine what technologies are needed to reduce future carbon dioxide emissions. Nuclear energy can make the greatest reduction by the year 2010, and is essential to further reduce emissions below the 1990 level. Continued expansion of nuclear power after 2010, together with energy conservation, renew- ables, and especially greater use of natural gas, would continue to lower emissions. Even with a choice of the more than 200 energy technologies considered in the model, however, no drastic emission reduction can be achieved in Japan with the assumed growth in energy and the national economy. The case against nuclear reactors due to logistics will be addressed in contention 4. Comtention two: Sub A: I agree with the basic issue of safe nuclear waste and radioactivity. Methods must be (and are being) developed in order to safely store nuclear waste, and recycle spent rods. Even so, the problem will not be eliminated by eliminating nuclear energy and/or not expanding nuclear energy which now consists of 20% of American energy production. Most nuclear waste comes from nuclear non-proliferation treaties, research facilities, and excess military grade plutonium and uranium. All these issues must be addressed, but opposition to nuclear energy has only stalled progress for the past 30 years. Sub B: Nuclear power does cause air pollution. BUT when compared to pollution caused by the burning of fossile fuels, the pollution from nuclear energy then becomes negligable when considering an alternative to fossile fuels. 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions, and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel (WHO). In the U.S. alone, fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year. A coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. Most of the exposure to radiation in the US comes from normal background radiation and medical procedures. No studies have ever shown a higher percentage of radiation amongst residents living close to power plants than residents anywhere else in the US. Sub C: That estimate is not from ""the State of New York"". The estimated fish deaths are caused by the cooling systems, which use natural water sources to cool plants, and fish eggs and small fish are caught in the cooling system and overheated. Technology has long existed that might reduce the fish kill by 90 percent or more. Cooling towers allow a power plant to recycle the water rather than continuously pump it in. New power plants are required to use cooling towers. The Indian Point issue is currently being litigated, and that is an outdated plant. The Oyster Creek Reactor issue will be addressed in the same legislation. Contention 3: Cooling towers can resolve this issue. Sweden is not a leader in nuclear power, and I would urge you to address concerns and issues occuring in the US, as the debate is about nuclear energy in the US. Chernobyl is often cited as the dangers of nuclear energy, but that reactor was completely outdated and the technology behind it was far behind anything in the US at the time. Contention 4: The NRG and other agencies estimate that every new power plant will create 6,000 construction and 1,000 permanent operating jobs (more conservative estimates put construction at 2,400 jobs). I'm running out of room, so I will await my opponent's response and respond accordingly."	PRO	265

S2f07394f-A20e8a229	America should expand nuclear energy production.	"I would like to thank con for this debate. He is the best opponent that I have faced. I will defend my case and then attack his. Argument 1: My opponent says that France as an example does notwork due to America having more resources and the three mile island incident. We import almost half of our oil. I would not call this ""abundant natural reserves"". The three mile island incident was due to lack of proper training and nobody was even harmed in the incident.[1] France still is a valid example that we can base our code and nuclear progress from. France also has some of the lowest electricity costs of any country.[4] Argument 2: He says that natural disasters are reasons to stop the expansion of nuclear energy.[2] The largest storm and a storm that is breaking records cannot breach the nuclear safe wall. My opponent says that the storms will continue to grow because of global warming. This will be true only if we do not grow out nuclear energy production. The Japanese did not defend against the design flaw.[3] They did not. It is not the same as the one in America. The advanced reactors, the ones we would be building, stayed up and shut down safely. The argument about cost:[5] ""20 percent of U.S. electricity comes from 104 nuclear reactors on about 100 square miles."" This also can have something to do with cost. The cost of land.[4]"" Producing the same amount of power from wind would require covering an area the size of West Virginia with 183,000 50-story turbines as well as building 19,000 miles of new transmission lines through scenic areas and suburban backyards""while building a nuclear plant does require money to build the payoff is very worth it. We will have more land to work with and instead of buying we could sell or do something worthwhile off of. Nuclear is the cheapest when it is already established. ""nuclear plant built in the near future to cost around ""70 per megawatt hour over its lifetime. The figure for gas would be ""95/MWh, for coal it would be ""130/MWh and for wind the cost is even higher, around ""145/MWh"" [4]Nuclear is worth it. Safety concerns: Chernobyl was a completely different type of reactor than American reactors. The American reactors are the 5 that did not break down during fukoshima and did not break down during the record breaking storm Sandy. My opponent also acts like the BP oil spill did not happen. The Alaskan oil spill and this is just in the past few years while my opponent is going back to 40 years ago.The point is that to act like nuclear energy is the only source of energy to have problems is not true. Solar, wind, and geothermal simply cost way too much. Natural gas is just far too risky.[6] The waste issue that my opponent asks me to address.""And thanks to technology, we can safely recycle ""nuclear waste"" and turn most of it into more fuel. After recycling, the French are able to store all of their final waste""from producing 80 percent of their electricity for 30 years""in one room in La Hague."" The problem is one of the past. 30 years of production and the largest problem is still in only one room.

The SeaGen 1.2MW commercial demonstrator has been developed on the basis of results obtained from SeaFlow, the world's first full-size tidal turbine installed by Marine Current Turbines off Lynmouth Devon in 2003. It has taken the subsequent four years for Marine Current Turbines to design and build SeaGen and secure the necessary environmental and planning consents. SeaGen is a commercial demonstration project with permission to operate in Strangford Lough for a period of up to 5 years. It is intended as the prototype for commercial applications of the technology that will follow. Martin Wright, Managing Director of Marine Current Turbines said: ""SeaGen's installation is a very significant milestone for both Marine Current Turbines and the emerging marine energy sector. Following from our previous experience with SeaFlow, our 300kW experimental test system installed in 2003 off the north Devon coast we are confident that SeaGen will show that tidal energy can be truly competitive with other forms of power generation. Decentralized tidal current energy is fundamentally predictable and sustainable. It is also environmentally benign."" Commenting on the future prospects for tidal current energy, Martin Wright added: ""We will build on the success of SeaGen to develop a commercial tidal farm, of up to 10MW in UK waters, within the next three years. With the right funding and regulatory framework, we believe we can realistically achieve up to 500MW of tidal capacity by 2015 based on this new SeaGen technology."" Recognizing the special marine environment of Strangford Lough, MCT has undertaken a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme. This program is already active and is managed by Royal Haskoning, a leading environmental consultancy, working in partnership with Queen's University Belfast and the St Andrews University Sea Mammals Research Unit. The program is overseen by an independent body, chaired by David Erwin, a former Chief Executive of the Ulster Wildlife Trust. The A2SEA jack-up barge, ""JUMPING JACK"", is planning to mobilize from Belfast's Harland & Wolf shipyard, where SeaGen is already complete and waiting, to Strangford Lough on August 20th. It is expected that the drilling of a single pile into the seabed and the installation of the twin-turbine device will take 14 days, with commissioning and power generation to the local grid shortly afterwards. Martin Huss, Sales & Marketing Director of A2SEA said: ""We are delighted to be working with MCT on this important and challenging project and hope it is the start of a long and rewarding relationship as tidal technology enters the market place in the UK."" The blades are designed for bi-directional flow, so that they turn regardless of which way the tide is rushing. They'll spin 10 to 20 times per minute. The company says this is slow enough to allow fish and other sea creatures to get out of the way if they're swimming on through. But it certainly doesn't sound like anything a diver would want to approach. This Seagen installation may be just the first step. As part of another project, the company is also hoping to install a farm of underwater turbines off Wales that would be capable of powering thousands of homes. my sorces are from popsci.com and also alternative-energy-news.com"	PRO	268

Sae50ee6c-Ab43a4651	The US Should Subsidize Nuclear Power	I had to rush this argument, so if it seems rushed I apologize in advance. Framework: In this debate I need to prove that the US should provide subsidies to nuclear power. This means if I can show any source of nuclear power should be subsidized, I win. Essentially, if I can show the Pros outweigh the Cons and that it should be provided financial assistance from the government. This does not mean that only nuclear power should be subsidized, but simply that nuclear power should be among the electricity sources subsidized (if there are others). C1-Environmental Concerns: While producing electricity nuclear power produces no greenhouse gas emissions. (1) This is because all nuclear energy is, is simply mass which has been converted to energy, explained by the formula: E=mc^2 Where “E” is energy, “m” is mass, and “c” is the speed of light. (2) This is extremely important due to the Greenhouse Effect (3): The downsides of having more heat in the world are that it leads to coral reefs dying, dangerous weather patterns, extinction of certain species of animals and plants, among other things. (4) With these problems it is clear that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, especially in the US which releases 15.6% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the world (despite having only 4.43% of the world’s population). (5, 6) Examining where the US releases much of its emissions we can see that electricity is one of the largest sources at 31%: (7) For this reason it is clear that any form of energy which doesn’t emit any greenhouse emissions must be prioritized or else the whole planet is in huge trouble, so therefore it is absolutely critical nuclear power is subsidized. C2-Large Electricity Source: Nuclear Power can produce a huge amount of energy, to help power the country, which will greatly lower the need for coal, natural gas, and oil based electricity. Also, it will bring a lot of money into the country. In fact, nuclear power itself is much more efficient than using fossil fuels for electricity. (8) This is why France, which generates over 75% of its electricity from nuclear power is the world’s largest net exporter of electricity. This also helps France gain over €3B (about $3.3B) a year. (9, 10) What also makes nuclear power provide so much electricity is that nuclear fuel can be recycled, presuming it has more fissile materials. This helps France generate about 17% of its total electricity. (9) For this reason, nuclear power is a very strong option for electricity, as it would generate a huge amount of electricity and eventually bring in some money, and therefore should be subsidized. C3-Cost: Although it is a large upfront cost (hence the subsidies) nuclear power is overall a cheap energy source. Uranium is cheap and since that is the main component in nuclear fissions reactions, it lets electricity be generated cheaply. (11) For this reason, the French pay very low amounts for electricity. (9) Due to cheapness electricity can be generated, nuclear power should be subsidized. C4-Thorium Reactors & Nuclear Fusion Reactors: Currently nuclear energy is primarily generated through nuclear fission of uranium, but in the future it may be done through thorium reactors and/or nuclear fusion which are both even better options. Nuclear fusion would be a greatly powerful energy source (more powerful than fission), but would have no nuclear waste (which is a problem with many present nuclear fission reactors) & would be much safer. This would make nuclear fusion reactors an almost perfect energy source, as there are no significant downsides, but it would be the most powerful energy source ever. In fact, with funding by 6 countries (including the US) and the European Union, a fusion reactor is currently being produced in France. (12) Seeing how close we may actually be to generated electricity by fusion on a large scale, the US really should begin to subsidize the industry. Another alternative nuclear reactor could be a thorium reactor. It would generate less nuclear waste than current uranium based nuclear fission reactors, would be cheaper, and potentially safer. (13) It will require more research (so subsidies are needed), but currently both Canada & China are producing a modified CANDU style nuclear reactor which will use thorium as fuel. (13) This is all great, but without funding it will have a lot of problem taking off the ground, so the US would be wise to fund it. Conclusion: Current nuclear reactors are better for the environment and generate much more electricity for less money (after construction) than current fossil fuel reactors, and therefore should be subsidized. Also, with the potential for thorium based reactors and nuclear fusion reactors which will be even better than current fission reactors, their research and production should also be subsidized.

Sefd746e-A38e41262	Nuclear Power VS. Solar Power	Arguments : 1. Generally, it is believed that we can not use solar energy after sun sets. However, epoch-making technology is emerging. That is to store the sun`s heat in molten salts.(Scientific American, August 4,2010. http:blogs.scientificamerican.com) According to it, ``the power plant can harvest enough heat to generate five megawatts of electlicity, day or night, and can store enough energy to keep producing power even at night or during cloudy daytime hours.``(http:blogs.scientificamerican.com) 2. According to the Scientific American, ``solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.`s electlicity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050.``(January, 2008 Issue) For example, ``a vast area of photovoltaic cells would have to be erected in the Southwest. Excess daytime energy would be stored as compressed air in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours. Large solar concentrator power plants would be built as well. A new direct-current power transmission backbone would be deliver solar electlicity across the country.``(January, 2008 Issue) We must admit that a new energy revolution is going on these days.	CON	271
Sbc6467-A3ed84459	Solar Electic Power	"Solar Costs We are in good agreement on the cost of the installed system. There are pluses and minuses in my calculations. The guarantee on solar panels is that they will produce 80% of their original output after 25 years, not 100%. I think the battery backup system will need to be larger, mainly to make sure that is never more than half discharged, a requirement to ensure the battery life. On the other hand, I think the professional installation costs are less than Ore_Ele estimated. I'm willing to go with an installed cost of $78,660.60. I was going to figure the average costs per year, but working with total costs over 25 years is fine. The $78,660 investment is a hedge against inflation, so it's fair to compare it to grid costs that will rise with inflation. However, there are additional costs associated with the solar electric system that will rise with inflation. We must figure the costs of maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes over the 25 year period. A low estimate for inflation is 2.5% per year. That's about what we had in the period from 2000 - 2009. That compounds to 28% per decade, or 85% over 25 years. I'll total the yearly costs and then figure inflation on top of that. I use the estimate of six roof maintenance actions per year. The minimum to get a service person to come to your house for any reason is about $50. That's $300/year. The battery maintenance, twice a year, can be done at the sae time as cleaning, so figure another $50 total, for $350 a year. Insurance on a a home is about $4.10 for each $1000 of home price. I figure that from the average house value of $173K http://bubblemeter.blogspot.com... and the average insurance bill of $725. http://homeinsurance.com... The solar electric system will start out costing $322 per year to insure. When you make an improvement to your home, your taxes will go up. Real estate taxes vary considerably, with the most expensive places having the lowest tax rates and the least expensive the highest tax rates. The median rate is about $10 per $1000 of assessed valuation. The solar electric system will cost about $786 per year in increased taxes. Even though the economic value of the solar electric system decreases with, the assessment ignores that. The yearly cost of having the system starts at $350 + $322 + $786 = $1458 per year. After 25 years, with minimal inflation, it would be $2697. Roughly figuring the average, that would be $51,937. However, the yearly cost could have been invested instead. Con likes to figure that as part of the other side of the calculation as part of the invest-the-money and buy from the grid calculation. I can go wih that. Without figuring the cost of capital, the solar electric system costs $130,797. for 25 years. The battery backup has some residual value at the end of the period, but the solar panels need to be replaced and a new system installed. The Grid Alternative Con notes that electricity costs have risen 4.6% per year since 2003. That's more than the 2.5% average inflation over that period. From 1984 to 1999 the inflation adjusted price of electricity dropped. The price of oil was rising, but electricity is generated from coal and natural gas, which are in abundant supply in the US. The fuel prices should be dropping as mining and drilling technology improves. Nuclear power costs are not much affected by fuel prices, and the technology is improving. The reason grid electricity is increasing in cost is due to unnecessary political costs. Politics are causing valuable plants to be retied early, and building a new plant is more costly than ever. It's extremely difficult to even get a site for a solar facility, let alone a nuclear generating plant. The smart grid is expensive and only required to cope with unreliable energy sources like wind and solar. We should be figuring a decreasing cost of grid electricity. Never mind, I'll use the 4.6% per year increase. The cost of the grid alternative starts with putting $78,660 into an account. Each year the grid cost of electricity is deducted from the account, The grid cost increases each year at 4.6. Interest at 4.3% is added to the account balance. We also add to the account the money spent on the maintenance, insurance, and taxes for that solar electric system. With the grid alternative, with a 2.5% increase each year for inflation, those costs would not have been paid out, so they could have been saved instead. The calculations were put into an exciting spreadsheet. The solar power system cost $130,797. The residual value of the solar power system is less than $10,000. After 25 years, the grid alternative spent $59,278 on grid electricity and there is a residual value of $184,804 in the account. Including the cost of capital, the solar electric system cost was ($78K + $184K - $10K)/$59K = 4.3 times the grid cost. Other Considerations a) For a while the solar panels are an asset, but after 25 years they have to be replaced, so they are not an asset. Some of the battery system life remains. I put the asset value, generously, at $10,000 in may calculations, b) Selling electricity back to the utility company at the wholesale value is actually a subsidy to the solar electric system on the house. The homeowner is using the grid without paying for the grid capital and maintenance costs, and the grid costs are increased substantially by requiring a grid ""smart enough"" to absorb the extra power. The system is properly figured as an off-grid enterprise. If the system is consistently generating too much power, then it was over designed. If it only occasionally generating surplus power, then you are asking the power company to buy it when it's not needed. c) I think the maintenance costs are underestimated. The system is complex enough to have failures in the panels, inverters, wiring, and batteries. The technlogy is in it's infancy. Failures shouldn't be frequent, but when they occur they will require competent attention. d) It's true it gives the homeowner an opportunity to save money by doing his own installation and maintenance. However, as a do-it-yourself project, it's still going to require $50,000 of ready cash. A person with that much free cash probably has an occupation with a high wage, so the person's time is more valuable spent on the job that playing with solar. If putting is a hobby, no problem. I recommend a solar hot water system if you really enjoy maintenance. e) Check my reference [3] for a different story on battery maintenance. It's not horrible, but it is something. f) Insurance cost estimtes are probably low. Wait until insuranc ecompanies learn about solar panels interacting with hail storms and hurricanes. g) The ""average homeowner"" is oddly the best case. Go north and the shorter days and frequent snow cover make the economics worse. Go south and the high summer air condiioning loads mean higher summer peak loads and more panels. Solar is now more than four times the cost of the grid for the average homeowner. It may seem somehow unfair to include all those maintenance, tax, and capital costs. The reason it is fair is that utilities have to include those costs. they are real and inescapable. Everyone should aspire to live in the same school district as a nuclear power plant, because after the real estate taxes are dived up, you are going to be paying about 29 cents for schools. Capital costs dominate the utility industry. The whole trick to making green energy seem reasonable is to ignore real costs in the comparisons. I believe the situation will change. Give solar another twenty years and it may well be there. I'm all for it. But it's not close now."	CON	272
See0f4916-A375fb110	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"To begin, I will like to thank my opponent for initiating this debate. His honest and timely responses are certainly helpful in maintaining the rhythm of this debate. Firstly, my opponent fortified his position through the subjective opinion of a judge who has never worked as an economist. I backed mine with facts and asked the readers to judge for themselves. Plenty of influential conomists pointed their fingers against Greenspan's lax monetary policies over the year. If you really need someone to tell you what to think, critics of governmental role in initiating the financial crisis include Nouriel Roubini (worked at International Monetary Fund, supervised Tim Geithner the current Treasury Secretary, and served as a senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisors during the Clinton administration), Bill Fleckenstein (of Fleckenstein Capital), and Peter Schiff (of Euro Pacific Capital Inc. and a 2010 candidate for the U.S. Senate). If my opponent really wishes to base an argument entirely on someone else's opinion, the least he could do would be finding a REAL economist who did not talk about economics simply through the context of laws. Readers, however, should briefly review the aforementioned timeline and will reach the conclusion that governmental intervention was an undeniable catalyst to the creation of the subprime crisis. Secondly, I completely agree with the potential benefits of IFR development. But while IFR can be desirable, my argument was directed toward my opponent's argument regarding IFR's NECESSITY as a solution to a nuclear volcano. When asked whether the development would be aimed for burning up existing waste or dealing with waste in future reactors, Dr Chu indicated ""[IFR] could be for existing, but mostly for future waste."" Clearly, Dr Chu did not share the sense of urgency for IFR or nuclear volcano which my opponent had falsely suggested. IFR would be a good invention to have, but we do not need to for dealing with nuclear volcanoes. Thirdly, I found it amusing how my opponent kept mentioning the impending doom of nuclear volcano when the man responsible for the energy stability of this nation clearly did not share his view. Every enthusiast always introduces his sales pitch with the promise of low cost and extremely high return, but the government has clearly been a poor judge for profitability. Countless projects have been ""initiated"" and ""incentivized"" since the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 yet we are still experiencing record high unemployment rate at 9.7 percent (http://www.bls.gov...). I believe the number speaks for itself of government ability to ""create jobs."" Fourthly, I shall ask the reader to do this experiment on your own to determine whether you agree that IFR development is such an emergency. Add all your bills to get your total annual expense. Take all your income to get your total annual income. Now increase all your expense by 10% and take a 16% cut on all you incomes. Yes, that was exactly what happened between 2008 and 2009 to the federal government according to White House Office of Management and Budget. Now, are you more likely to worry about paying your mortgage, health insurance, and college tuition or are you more like to borrow more money to buy a solar power system for you roof? If you are not considering ""substantial increase"" to your alternative energy investment, then you have just demonstrated to fallacies in my opponent's polls. I too wish for a decrease in defense and healthcare while investing in more environmentally viable energy solution. But as the readers should clearly see now, are you going to care that about much energy when you're broke or will you just start walking to buy groceries? Fifthly, my opponent proposed striking out my argument for free market mechanism. It is the law of this land and our market participants are educated with and used to this practice. Arbitrary involvements in the market curtailing or inflating either supply or demand threaten participant confidence and create market inefficiencies both in theory and throughout history (bubbles, black market, you name it). While I agree that free market capitalism can lead to environmental destruction, will the readers rather the government passing laws to establish punishment for environmental destruction or taking over private companies to direct the future of technological development? My opponent blindly focused only on the good and completely ignored the bad of market intervention, but I demonstrated that one must consider both pros and cons of any government action before hastily force a new change onto an existing society. The focus is not whether free market capitalism is causing environmental destruction. The focus is whether the benefits of free market innovation including those in waste management justify the absence of government involvement. Therefore, this argument is core to this debate because balance ultimately determines whether the federal should shift resources and accept the consequence of trade off proposed by the topic in discussion. Sixthly, my opponent attacks my assertion regarding the core issue of Chinese development. Since most Chinese scholars who dare to point fingers at the current officers are probably dead by now, I am indeed a little short on support from commentators. But if the readers can consider the situation critical, they should be able to see the reasons behind my argument. Since China was completely regulated to begin with, wouldn't intentional de-regulation of an immature technology or enterprise be another form of government intervention? In developed nations, companies without proper waste management technology would naturally face strong opposition and litigation from its victim. Therefore, continuing prosperity of these polluters can only be justified by government protection or legal favoritism. Instead of asking the readers to blindly believe in any ""expert"" which debater choose to cite, I ask the readers to go through the logic and evidence of each argument on their own. Most importantly, private corporations have plenty of incentive to spend money to fix the environmental damages they create because either government or civil unrest will force them to. It is just plain ridiculous to assume there's no trade-offs. THERE ARE ALWAYS TRADE-OFFS. IFR's will be developed by the private market when it is actually economically feasible. PERIOD. Most importantly, WE WILL ALL DIE IN A HORRIBLE NUCLEAR VOLCANO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE DEVELOP IFR'S (if the situation is to occur). If Dr. Chu does not share my opponent's urgency, I urge the readers to ignore my opponent's paranoia. Yucca Mountain was chosen and built by the government as a nuclear waste site. If anyone is to blame for a nuclear volcano, THE GOVERNMENT IS. If Yucca Mountain was closed down, then the private sector must seek alternative energy solution IMMEIDATELY because they have no authority (neither will they want the responsibility) to handle radioactive materials. In the end, this is a matter of priority. Does the reader believe that the government should sacrifice other programs for the development of alternative energy RIGHT NOW? Everything about my opponent's proposal is great except its timing. His lack of financial reality renders his plan impractical and the federal government must not engage in such irresponsible act. For every dollar we borrow or print, our future generation must pay the debt especially when our current balance sheet is already an international embarrassment. Although my opponent has delivered you a fancy sales pitch and the image of a promising future, I have provided cold hard facts of the financial health of our federal government. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, ""Buy what thou hast no Need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries."" (Buy what you have no need of and not long you shall sell your necee"	CON	273
Sb4dd79ae-Abda4969f	Nuclear Energy	"I thank my opponent for a very enjoyable debate and look forward to more in the future. In this final round, I will go ahead and first, address my opponent's round 3 arguments, and second, post a summary. 2) Safety. While the three accidents are worthy of mention, they do not provide logically reason to support that nuclear energy is unsafe, anymore so than arguing that the Ford Pinto supports that cars in general are unsafe. If anything, they show of individual cases where safety was comprimised due to design issues (as with the pinto), nature, or human error. And I did refer to each of these individually in the last round to show how we learned from them to help us make sure that they never repeat (just like we learned from the design flaws of the pinto to make sure we never make something like it again). Regarding the safe transport of nuclear waste, I encourage everyone to watch at least the first 45 seconds of the attached video [video]. Nuclear waste transportation is tested and tested and tested. There are not many things which are tested to the point where they are strapped to a rocket powered semi truck and rammed into a concrete wall to see if they stay intact. Going on to the safety of storing, remember that if we reporcess nuclear waste (as many other countries do), the waste will not have any actinides (like Pu239, U235, or U238, or Th232 and U233 in the Thorium cycle), making it much safer. To the point where you only need minimal protective gear (Enriched uranium can be handled by only a latex glove covered hands, it is the Pu239 in the un-processed waste that requires the full suits and robots). 3) Cost Cost has been shown that it is cheaper to run (once built) than all current fossil fuel power sources, and it is cheaper than all alternative energy sources in start up costs (with the exception of dams, however, their restriction of having to be on rivers makes their use limited, and unable to be a primary powersource for a large nation). My opponent has also stated that the cost would be too great for some poorer nations. This doesn't really make sense. Many people can't afford a Porche, does that mean no one should be allowed to have one? I've already shown that by having wealthy nations switch over to nuclear, that will free up some supply of coal and natural gas, which will bring the price down on those, and thus make them cheaper for the poorer nations and ultimately help them and their economy, as an indirect result of nuclear energy. Regarding the magentic generators, anyone and everyone should be instantly skeptical of anything that promises free fueless energy. Most of these claim to be based from ""the lost Tesla Generator"" which Tesla didn't view as practical and never rebuilt them after his wearhouse burnt down (while he did rebuild other inventions). Most of these are no more real than that Nigerian Prince wanting to give away some of his money, the same is true for all perpetual motion devices. Regarding the quote from Arthur Schopenhauer, such a saying is known as Galieo's gambit, a logical fallacy. While it is true that many ""truths"" are first laughed at, not everything that is laughed at is a ""truth."" Moving on to my closing summary. I have shown that the effectiveness of nuclear energy far surpasses that of any other power source, both in quantity of power, and in the locations it can be used. These went pretty much entirely unchallenged. For safety, the main concerns where several spotlighted examples, all of which were addressed in my round 3 and were not challenged in my opponent's round 3. For cost, we can see that nuclear energy has a higher start up cost, but much lower fuel cost, meaning that over the long run, it costs much less. And this will allow other nations to obtain other fuels at lower prices. Regarding the opponent's arguments on various alternatives, those were all addressed and none of the addresses countered (though the magnetic generators was explained in greater detail and was only addressed in this round, so my opponent can counter the address in his next round). With that, I end my rounds of this debate and await my opponent's closing round. Again, thank you for the debate. http://www.youtube.com..."	PRO	274
Sf1a21db5-A960cb4c5	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"I will concede inherently, thank you for clearing that up. SOLVENCY- I'm not entirely certain if your first paragraph was a rebuttal to my money argument or a generic argument so I'll treat it as both. The PRO says ""The point in the round is to only to substantially increase alternative energy INCENTIVES. Therefore, the plan creates an organization specific to creating fusion AND therefore incentives are increased. When the group is made to create fusion (which increases incentives), then they will not be able to spend the money on other stuff so the incentives ARE increased."" but this is not a solvency argument, this is a topicality argument, and as you know I have already conceded topicality, solvency does not focus on the ability to meet the resolution, rather to accomplish what the resolution wants to accomplish ie. help the environment, so we must ask ourselves, will the plan really solve the problem, and will it be worth it, in my upcoming arguments I will prove that the plan will not solve. The PRO's plan states that a group of scientists will be created and that the government will give money to a group of scientists, but the group the money is going to already exists so it is not the same group that the government goes too, therefore the PRO still has not proved that the group will have no hidden agendas yet. My opponent says that ""I do not have to show that fusion power WILL be obtained"", but if he cannot prove this, will he really solve? The answer is no, the fact that we have been trying for 50 years and have not got fusion energy shows that it likely wont happen so unless he can prove it will, we must assume he will solve nothing. The Federation of American Scientists states that ""because of the low abundance of deuterium, an enormous amount of water would have to be boiled to obtain useful amounts of deuterium"" http://www.fas.org... Unless my opponent shows evidence that the benefits which may or may not occur outweigh the risks which would undoubtedly occur my evidence, being the only evidence on the issue shows that there could be serious environmental issues from the harvesting of deuterium. SIGNIFICANCE AND HARMS From- Philadelphia Daily News - A nuclear power plant worker was charged yesterday with spiking a lunchroom cooler with radioactive water that eight men drank before the contamination was discovered. The eight who drank the contaminated water last month at the Point Lepreau plant have a slightly higher chance of getting cancer, officials said. http://www.philly.com... The water was from a plant that created deuterium from heavy water, and used it for nuclear fission, it clearly shows that harvesting deuterium does in fact pollute water, think of what would happen if this water were released somehow, no one would know until it was too late. From -AECL-http://www.aecl.ca... ""the Girdler process involves large amounts of hydrogen sulfide, raising environmental concerns."" This process refers to the production of deuterium, and the process it speaks of is the most economical, and arguably the only corporately viable process for producing deuterium from heavy water. I have clearly shown some of the negatives of deuterium production, and still press for evidence that there is no pollution, although the PRO is correct in saying that it is the CONs job to show disadvantages, once someone claims something such as ""No Air Pollution"" it is their job to bring evidence proving their point. The rest of my opponents arguments are his generic topicality argument which he attempts to use on other issues, so him claiming that he meets the resolution does not mean that the harms outweigh the risks."

S45c09d10-A38812bc	government should intervene more with alternative fuel	"You say it's common sense that we can't use all that land and so facts and such don't matter. If you read those links I gave and my intro statement, the fuel doesn't come from land, like corn... it comes from organic material like corn husks, other cellulose material, switchgrass (more energy intensive than corn and not corn), algae farms (which cna be grown in the dessert), and other non-harmful to us methods. If we used algae... it'd take the land size of maryland. see the wiki links. Again, Brazil is energy independant on sugar cane... just one type of alternative, but the point is made that it's possible generally. You're creating a problem where there is none. ""the real argument, though, i'm posing is that we should not be against the government's intervention, just because."" ---Just because period? Please give some explanation. Your argument seems to be that goverment intervention is by definition the least economical way to do things... but you don't provide any arguments to refute my points other than vague ""invisible hand"" rhetoric. (and some misguided factual info on your part) Really, the argument shouldn't be so much on the science of whether it's possible, but rather, if it's possible and at the 2 dollar level etc that they claim, should the govenrment intervene? You're finding so many ways to actually avoid actually arguing th point of the debate with me. ""---The problem with this argument is that there are two different choices from two different backgrounds. In the world of the PRO, the government would be ""effectively paying two dollars"" but then thered be more usage of gas and more usage of ethanol leading to more usage of land and more usage of water, whereas if you negate, then you have the same ""two dollars"" except only without all the other disadvantages of ethanol."" I acknowledged raising the fuel standard would mean we shouldn't be using ethanol, right now. I said we'd have to postpone intervention till later, perhaps. This is just a misreading on your part, and doesn't attack whether the gov should intervene at some time. """"you never responded to the substance of my argument: that having the fuel economy would save us money."" ---Yeah, I didn't. I never mentioned money at all in my case. I don't see why it matters, and I see different things that matter. Is there a problem?"" Well, the problem is that you should be addressing my points more. Even if it's just a theoretical argument... cause that's the point of this thread. Plus, you might not be so right abotu the factual nature of th sitaution, ie how much water is used or land.. etc. So you need to argue other things more. ""you haven't given any evidence of how the rich DO lead."" THen you can afford to buy cars, and you're better off than most people. Even if you're poor and you put all your money into cars, you're the exception to th e rule. The general rule is that, and this is common knowledge so i'm not sure why I'm even debating this, poorer people get their cars from the richer. Most people drive used cars. This is not rocket science. ""How the heck is she affirming? The resolution says ""government should intervene more with alternative fuel"". Well.... Intervene where? How do you intervene with more alternative fuel? Does the government like, go somewhere and douse people in ethanol? Her case has absolutely no link to what the topic is."" I said in my initial post that gas stations get subsidies and or loans... and perhaps fuel plants... and i suppose i'd add to that deductions for alt fuel ussage to car buyers. also, incidentally... i looked at your candidate mike gravel's site... http://www.ontheissues.org... and he thinks wind power can get us off gasoline in five years.... that's very hard to believe cars and all that would work. but anyway, whatever method we use, the government should intervene. you'd almost have to have them intervene if we went to wind. again, my main point is that if there's a viable alternative out there that's relatively cheap, gov should intervne. you've avoided this issue, the whole poit of this debate, like the plaque."

Sd3d77219-Ab1a1967e	the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels	why the government should intervene more with alternative fuel. people say the market will take care of itself. in the end, it will. but at what cost in the mean time? we should act now because we'll look back and see how much we've wasted on gasoline. companies say they can make alternative biodiesel fuels for a dollar a gallon. (using algae farms, or any organic material, such as switch grass and other things more energy intensive than corn etc.. and exemplified by brazil etc who are energy dependent right now from gas) but, there's a catch 22 occurring. alternative energy companies often must put operations on hold. why? because there's no demand. the consumers who make demand say there's no supply. who can afford as a consumer to buy alternative vehicles? the richer. does the rising prices right now of gasoline hurt them? not as much so they don't buy. but, even if they bought cars sometimes as they are now, there's still not much there in way of an infrastructure for the supply and demand sides. the rich won't start buying more until it really starting hurting them. the poor won't do it cause they can't. the middle won't do it, probably for the same reason. it's conventional wisdom that the rich are the ones who start these new technologies... and the conventional wisdom is probably true here too. but, unlike many situations with conventional wisdom... for alternative fuel, waiting till the rich start the technology isn't in the best interest of the country right now. that's because... unlike for many other things, like buying a DVD player... fuel isn't something that's simply a perk as much, and is a regular and substantial cost for the consumer. it has a noticeable affect on the economy. while we're waiting for the rich to convert, what's happening? in the mean time, the poorer are spending their money on gas, or not being as productive. consider all that money they're spending on that, when they could be spending on an array of other things, going to the economy at large- you could buy a bunch of stuff, and support a bunch of companies, instead of a few companies, gas companies. (and foreigners, which is a major concern in and of itself) to make it more of a practical example. say a new biodiesel machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand. all that money that the poorer are wasting right now would have been more than enough to either subsidize or lend to that station. (you could lend the money to them... and ensue they make a tidy profit before they ever have to pay it back, if ever considering there's a risk they might not make money) if we invested in them as a government then, the effects would be much sooner, and the poorer and middle class would save more, and it'd be a boon to the economy. (plus all the jobs involved with the transitioning infrastructure) government intervention is the way to break the catch 22 sooner when it'll make a difference for the economy, than later when we'll look back and see all that wealth that has been squandered. as to the argument the government should not be 'picking winners'. this is mostly based on the idea that who knows what technology will prevail. biodiesal, electric cars, etc. but, we can act as a hedge, and catalyst. making the companies get a head start to start sorting out the direction the economy should go. i personally would be opposed to a 'Manhattan project' type situation, cause we'd put so much resources into a certain technology that might not even be the best. but we can act as catalysts.

Se6216237-A9418bddf	Resolved: Allowing deep water offshore oil drilling is in the best interest of the United States.	"Thanks to my opponent for responding! My opponent's points: 1. The oil spill was greatly exaggerated. To support this claim, my opponent cites the blog of a libertarian political commentator and activist named Lew Rockwell. This blog is a collection of articles and posts by Rockwell and other libertarians. I was unable to find the specific article from which my opponent drew his quote – however, I would like to point out that Rockwell's work is politically slanted. Among Rockwell's articles we find predictions about the imminent end of the United States, arguments against our participation in World War Two, and other strongly opinionated writings. Whether or not one agrees with Rockwell is beside the point, because my intent is to demonstrate that Rockwell is neither a scientist nor a neutral journalist. In my post I cite direct quotes from scientists who have done hands-on research, while my opponent cites what is essentially an Op-Ed. I therefore maintain that my assertion about the dangers of the oil spill overshadows Rockwell's claim to the contrary. Next, my opponent agrees that the data he cited in his first post is inadequate as the data from the Exxon spill quantifies a decade while the Deepwater spill happened less than a year ago. However, he then transitions abruptly into an argument that does not apply to the environmental side of the issue, which is what we were discussing there. From his post: ""We do need to keep in mind about the spill times however we need to think of how The United States stands to benefit economically from offshore drilling if our judges vote for the con side of the debate then they killing many job opportunities."" This argument does nothing to disprove my point. Additionally, the claim about killing job opportunities was addressed in my first post and will be elaborated on in detail later in this post, when I illustrate the job-creation potential of switching to renewable energy sources. The next statement by my opponent is an amalgam of different ideas compiled into one incoherent paragraph. The first piece says: ""We feel very bad for those families that lost loved ones due to the BP blow out but we need to think are we going to let them die in vain? Are we going to let the money that were making be blown away? No if we eliminate these jobs were are cripiling our economy! When workers take these jobs THEY decide that having this job is better then having no jobs."" This is a bizarre appeal to emotion. He claims that stopping offshore drilling means the 11 lives lost because of the rig explosion would be in vain. This is a ridiculous idea. If anything, those 11 deaths provided further proof that offshore drilling is extremely unsafe, and their deaths would actually mean more if offshore drilling ceased. He then returns to his point about jobs, which again, has been addressed and will be elaborated on shortly. My opponent's next paragraph explains that he believes that new politicians need to be brought in to ensure that oil spills are not mishandled in the future. While I agree with him, that has nothing to do with the debate at hand. We are discussing the costs and benefits of offshore drilling, not the effectiveness of the leadership in our country and what can be done to improve it. My opponent's final point is not a point at all, as he apparently misread my post. He states that ""my opponent says in his case that workers are aware of dangers. Now im going to ask ALL of you out there to tell me what 2+2 equals"". I actually stated that workers were UNAWARE of the full range of dangers their jobs entail. And while I trust that everyone can add two and two, I'm unsure what the sum is supposed to tell us… My opponent ends his post with a duel challenge. First, he wants me to cite examples of alternative energy sources and explain how much they will cost the government and the length of time they will take to fully establish. In addition to answering this challenge, I will list specific the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy. Renewable energy essentially means deriving energy from sources which are naturally replenished. Essentially, renewable energy research is engaged in converting this natural energy into useable electricity. I will use as examples the two most prominent and practical forms of renewable energy. 1.Windpower The practice of using wind to spin turbines and generate power by use of windmills. This means of energy production has 0% output of greenhouse gasses, meaning it has effectively no impact on the environment once the construction of the windmill is complete. Wind power has the potential to produce 40 TIMES the global demand for power, meaning we would have forty times the power we actually need. While there is a land cost associated with windmills, setting up mills offshore would be an effective solution, as ocean winds are of much higher speeds and therefore produce more energy. (http://www.stanford.edu...) 2.Solar Power Generating power from the radiation of the sun through the use of solar panels. Again, no greenhouse gasses are emitted through the use of solar power. This energy source can be used to power everything from home appliances to vehicles. In fact, photovoltaic power (solar energy) is 85 times more efficient than ethanol gas or gasoline from oil, and cars powered by battery would produce no harmful emissions. A common misconception is that solar power is only available during daylight or in sunny areas. However, solar power can be stored in battery form and distributed worldwide. On a domestic scale, the deserts of the Southwestern United States could produce enough energy to meet the needs of the entire nation. (http://www.awarenessintoaction.com...) As demonstrated, utilizing a combination of solar and wind power would create vastly more energy than we need and produce zero emissions. There is seemingly no environmental reason not to convert to these sources, as there is a striking lack of danger involved in these sources when compared to the dangers offshore drilling poses to its employees. My opponent asked that I note how long it would take and how much it would cost to fully implement these sources of energy. First, renewable energy sources are already being invested in heavily. Renewable energy usage and development has grown by a larger and larger percentage each year since 2004, with some technologies gaining a 60% rise in a single year. Essentially, if the United States began to phase out oil now and invested money that would be used to establish offshore platforms to instead build windmills and solar powers, we would be able to mainstream renewable energy within five years. (http://www.ren21.net...). Another economic benefit: once the solar cells and windmills are built, they provide FREE ENERGY FOREVER. Additionally, while fossil fuel technologies get more and more expensive as time moves forward, windmills and solar cells get cheaper and cheaper, and as the demand for them rises, the price falls even further. (Our Choice, Bloomsbury 2009). This means that the more we invest in renewable energy, the less expensive it becomes, and the greater the returns become as a result. As far as the job creation potential is concerned, utilizing wind and solar power along with other types of renewable energy (such as hydropower, biomass, and ethanol), the Cleantech Jobs Trend Report for 2009 predicts that 16 million jobs will be created through renewable energy in the next twenty years. It notes that this will be the greatest job source since computers and the Internet entered the scene. Meanwhile, my opponent remarks on the benefit of creating a pithy 650,000 jobs through offshore drilling. I am going to dismiss my opponent's question about taxi drivers wearing biosuits as hyperbolic. Please avoid that in the future and good luck to you in"	CON	278

It also seems highly unlikely that deploying nuclear as a ‘bridge’ technology would be anything like that, certainly the history of energy production does not suggest that industries are likely to plan for their own extinction in favour of more environmentally sensitive technologies. This is especially true of nuclear power; it simply is not a short-term technology as the reprocessing and containment schedules are enormous.

Oil prices sustained strength continues to shove a great deal of cash into the hands of the world's oil exporters — cash that these countries cannot process internally and that therefore will either be stored in dollars or invested in the only country with deep enough capital pools to handle it: the United States. Add in the torrent of exports from the Asian states, which generates nearly identical cash-management problems, and the result is a deep dollarization of the global system even as the U.S. dollar gives ground. The currency steadily shifts from the one of ﬁrst resort to the true foundation of the entire system. Oliver Blanchard, 1/31/2008. The Class of 1941 Professor of Economics, is a former MIT economics department head. ""Economist sees US better withstanding high oil prices - Peak oil,"" Cherry Creek News, The increase in the price of oil helps finance the U.S. current account deficit. The reason is that oil producers know that oil revenues will not last forever, so they save a good part of those revenues. Not having great investment opportunities at home, they are eager to lend outside their country, and, in particular, to lend to the U.S. Such willing creditors allow the U.S. to continue to borrow abroad and to run a large current account deficit. Were it not for oil-producing countries, the demand for U.S. assets would be smaller, and the dollar would be even weaker than it is today. Thus, the only reason the U.S. has the ability to rack up such a debt is because dollar hegemony ensures that countries abroad lend to us. Therefore, keeping oil prices higher ensures that the government can maintain the power of the dollar even with such a debt. Faiting the aff would thus lead to an economic collapse within the U.S. Contention 2: High oil prices incentivizes alternative energy Braml is editor-in-chief of the Yearbook on International Relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) in Berlin. The Washington Quarterly • 30:4 pp. 117–130. 2007 Can the United States Shed Its Oil Addiction? Higher energy prices will provide strong market incentives to find alternative sources of energy, to develop new technologies, and to improve energy efficiency. For these effects, there is an additional driving force: increasing public concern about environmental damage caused by traditional forms of energy consumption. Bryce '07 [Robert Bryce lives in Austin, Texas and managing editor of Energy Tribune. Cheap crude will short-circuit the push for renewable energy. We've seen this before. The surge in oil prices that occurred after the 1973 oil embargo didn't last. As prices softened, so, too, did the interest in solar power, wind power and other technologies. The best hope for the renewable energy sector is a sustained period of high prices for fossil fuels of all types. THIS SOLVES EXTINCTION: Reynolds June 18 2003 ""EARTH 'IS HEADING FOR MASS EXTINCTION IN JUST A CENTURY"", The Scotsman THE worst mass extinction in the history of the planet could be replicated in as little as a century if global warming continues, according to new evidence. Researchers at Bristol University have discovered that a six-degree increase in the global temperature was enough to annihilate up to 95 per cent of species which were alive on Earth at the end of the Permian period, 251 million years ago. Up to six degrees of warming is now predicted for the next century by United Nations scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) if nothing is done about emissions of the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, which cause global warming. The end-Permian extinction event is a good model for what might happen in the future because it was fairly non-specific. ""The sequence of what happened then is different from today because then the carbon dioxide came from massive volcanic eruptions, whereas today it is coming from industrial activity. Climate experts and environmentalists said yesterday they were appalled that a disaster of such magnitude could be repeated within this century because of human activities."	CON	282
Sd3d77219-Ad7fcf246	the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels	My opponent even agrees that ethanol is a bad idea! She however claims sources from sugar and grass, for example, are sufficient to fix the problem. To this, I disagree. Vast amounts of land are needed to create biofuels due to its low energy density, about 0.3 watts per square meter. To switch to full corn crops to fuel our cars, it would take up 37% of the continental United States, if we uses Soy it would take up 1 billion more acres of land then the US even has! We would have to fill up all of the US and more in order to fuel our cars [1]. This problem would remain with all energy sources my opponent lists. We would have to have a lot of grass, we cant just take is from the ecosystem--I mean, that's kinda against this whole green thing. We cannot merely take the algae, there is probably not enough to take from nature and means of retrieval are probably expensive. We would need a lot of water in order to create algae farms, and even then, it will cost a lot, take up space, and be wholly inefficient. The fact is, biofuels should not be subsidized for a simple reason: they are ineffcient and impractical. My opponent claims that she supports these conventional fuel sources (again, if this is true, why should government favor alternatives), and that government will increase efficiency...False. Green energy takes up 3 times more subsidies than conventional fossil fuel energies, but is also about 3 times, sometimes more, expensive [2]. If something is truly efficient, it need not be subsidized. Investors and businessmen would create firms which distribute this energy. The free market provides a profit incentive, which is good at encouraging firms to use the best technology. If a technology is lacking, it loses. Why should the government fund lacking technology? Why back the losers? The free market would naturally move to gas most likely, reducing emissions and energy costs for everyone. My opponent is claiming that the government needs to bring alternative energy to the top, but as I argued, that would be a bad thing. But do subsidies really work? Green energy is inefficient and failing with government intervention. Governments have interfered with other fuel sources, which has promoted inefficient fuels, fuels which harm the enviroment, increase prices, obfuscate the market, and simply make the industry... worse [3]. That, to me, does not sound like efficiency. Let's assume that the government can make someting efficient--which it doesnt. Even if we assume this is true, do I lose? No, not really. Let's say we have two windows. One is cracked, the other is a nice replacement window. You argue lets put plastic over it, it will be stronger. I say, yes, it is stronger. However, this conventional replacement will be stronger than a weak cracked window with some thin cover. Which option sounds superior? My opponent, even if she is wholly correct, needs some foundation as to why increased alternative energy efficiency is the best route to take. If conventional methods are cheap, work, are robust, and save lives, why go to an inefficient source of energy--even if it is slightly more efficient with subsidies? It really doesn't make sense, even if her whole argument is correct, which it isnt. Wait... current energies strain the economy? So ethanol costing more, reducing mileage, and killing people is helping it? Cheap energy which works across the clock, keeps our homes warm (or cold) in different times of the year, creates jobs, is bad? Why give resources to other failing industries. If anything, that will create more of a strain to society, not less. If society uses one efficient energy source, it will benefit everyone. If we use 5, 2 are good 3 are bad, for example, thats better? It is a waste, if you ask me. You are giving resources to industries which fail to produce, and having to give to them is a drain of resources. To give to the sucessful industries, which deliver back energy and efficiency leads to a net gain, not a net loss. Supporting many industries sounds like a good idea, but in fact, it is a drain--not a gift. No demand for something? Wanna know why? Because it sucks. No one will pay extra--ok, almost no one--for heating on their home to be green. There is no demand because it is a failure, it is not a failure because there is no demand.

Sb4dd79ae-A2a576098	Nuclear Energy	"I thank my opponent for his argument. I will quickly dive into mine now. 1) Effectiveness. My opponent has admitted to passing on the effectiveness argument, choosing to focus on different potential short comings. As to save space, I will leave this as is and also focus on the different potentail short comings. 2) Safety. With this, I will break this down into two subsections, technical safety (a), and political safety (b). a) Normally, we would dismiss the mentioning of TMI (Three Mile Island), Chernobyl, and Fukushima as cases of spotlighting fallacies rather than accurate representations of the technology. Such fallacies would be like saying cars should not be allowed because the Ford Pinto was unsafe. However, for any engineer, it is vital to learn from mistakes so that they cannot happen again (when there are actually mistakes). Just like they learned from the Pinto to make a better, safer car, we too can learn from these three incidents how to make a better reactor. So we will actually look at each of these individually, as well as the safety record in whole of nuclear reactors. Going by year, we will first look at TMI, 1979 [1][2]. This was an incident that started because a relief valve became stuck open, causing the cooling fluids to leave the reactor. This was compounded by the fact that an operator mistook the lack of cooling fluid as too much cooling fluid, thus opening more values to let more out. The reactor over heated and the core melted (refered to as a meltdown), however, the melted core never breached the containment walls and was cooled back down by the automated system (all people had evacuated by then). A follow up report, the Komeny report [3], showed that no one had died from the radation releases, and that the releases were of a quantity that they would not have any measurable effect on the people in ther area. What have we learned from TMI [4][5]? We learned many things from TMI that have allowed us to not have a repeat, even though the damage from TMI was actually rather minor (apart from damage to the reactor itself). From improved training, better communication, and better configuration of the control rooms to allow better understanding of issues and faster, more accurate reaction from personnel. Moving on to the next, Chernobyl, 1986 [6]. Chernobyl is a unique disaster, that given the secrecy of the USSR at the time (we didn't even know about the incident until we discovered radioactive material in the air in Sweden). Chernobyl was using an RBMK style reactor [7], which the US and most of the western world knew was unsafe because of the use of a void coefficient and their particular fuel rod set up. With the reactor styles we have now, a Chernobyl style incident is not physically possible, even if someone got into the reactor control and tried to make it happen [8]. The latest, Fukushima, 2011. Fukushima is most definiately a spotlight example. While most of the others we look at and say ""what went wrong,"" which Fukushima, we can look at and say ""Holy crude, why didn't more go wrong?"" Fukushima reactors were all over 30 years old, with some over 40 years old. They we hit by a 9.0 earth quake followed shortly by a 50 foot tsunami. Yet somehow, they managed to hold out (about as well as Rocky did in his first movie). While most of the reactors ended up melting down from a disaster that would cripple any structure in the world, they've done a fair job contianing that material. While some radiation does escape, just like some did at TMI, there are no recorded deaths from the radiation, either on the plant, nor in the general public. And from this, we've been able to learn where the reactor had issues, and how to improve upon them going forward. Since accidents are learning opportunities, to see what you may have overlooked and places to do better, they can actually be very helpful to us. And in cases where the accident has no serious harm to society, the minor accidents can be viewed as possitives, so that we can get better at preventing the big accidents that do cause serious harm. Now I will look at the safety risks of aggressive nations having nuclear energy. My opponent points out that nations, such as Iran and North Korea, will hide their nuclear facilities, and as a result, may cut corners with them. This is not a good argument against nuclear energy, since it is the very prohibition of the nuclear energy that is causing them to be unsafe. By opening up, showing them the safe ways and the unsafe ways, and even helping them build them it has many benefits. 1) Safer power plants 2) Better relations between nations 3) More energy for the nation to help people get out of poverty and build their economy 4) More power to the people to fight against dicatorships Since electricity is needed to clean water, power hospitals, develop medicenes, run industry, and provide heat and air conditioning for people, it is vital to bettering the lives of the people in those nations, and thus bettering the relation between them and us. 3) Costs To answer my opponent's question regarding why more energy isn't done by nuclear energy, I have two responces. First, this isn't really a legitimate question. One could easly through this question upon his suggested alternatives, that since solar makes up so little energy, it must not be effective. In reality, better ideas, always take time to replace the status quo, and simply because something is being used used more commonly does not mean that it is more effective. The second part of the answer is a lack of knowledge, combined with false knowledge. In regards to nuclear energy, it is often called the China Syndrome, in reference to a 1979 movie (which came out only months before TMI), that showed nuclear reactors as bombs just waiting to go off. Since more people get their views from hollywood than from sciencewood, they are going to have opinions based on incorrect knowledge. While many African and Latin American nations are not wealthy enough to produce nuclear, by us generating more nuclear, that cuts the demand for natural gas and coal (and other fuels). This drop in demand, turns into a drop in cost of those materials, and the drop in cost will help the people in those poorer nations. Moving on to the alternatives that my opponent has listed, I will quickly address them one by one (1,500 characters left, sorry). Hydro - Hydro is limited by rivers, while many nations do have a lot of rivers, many do not, and so hydro is not adequate for them. Hydro also takes much longer to build, as it develops the entire ecosystem around it (turning a river into a lake). Solar - While solar is my ultimate energy fav, it too has its limits. Many northern nations are going to find solar to be less than ideal. Even here in Oregon, we find that it is only the edge. As only getting 5 sun hours a day (on average over a year), one would need 4,800 MW solar field to equal the same as a single 1,000 MW nuclear (or coal, or natural gas, or anything that can run 24 hours a day). Move up into Canada or other northern nations, and that can stretch into 8,000 MW of solar to match the single 1,000 MW of nuclear. Wind - similar to solar. Kenetic - The generators that are listed are standard fuel generators. I'm not sure what Kenetic Generators are and could not find them on a quick search. But those that you listed, show that the 15 kW model uses 1.36gal/hr. It doesn't say what the fuel is, but if it takes 1.36 gal to make 15 kW of energy, or 1 gal to make 11.03 kW, the fuel has to cost about $1.10 per gallon to be comparible. And even then, these only have 5 year warrenties, and so would need to be replaced and repaired more often [9]. Sources http://www.debate.org..."	PRO	285

S3af9364a-A519b6668	Nuclear Power is the most viable substitute from fossil fuels	"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. First, the rebuttals on why geothermal energy would NOT be a viable resource to replace fossil fuels and why nuclear power would be a better choice. Geothermal energy as my opponent claims is everywhere. That's about the same as saying that we all live above Earth's core. If one drills 3 TO 4 MILES deep, one can reach temperatures of about 300 to 400F (about 200 degrees Celsius). I ask my opponent how this is economically viable in any way. Secondly, after doing some research on geothermal energy, I found that there are actually many requirements of locations of geothermal energies. One first needs magma that heats up ground water to 100 degrees Celsius (212 F) in order to be USABLE. My opponent uses the States as an example where geothermal energy is everywhere. It's not. It is only in Western USA, Alaska, and Hawaii that these geothermal place are actually viable. I quote from a website on geothermal. ""To be both usable and economical a (geothermal) site must have an adequate volume of hot water or steam that is not too impure to use, a surface water source to cool generating equipment, and close proximity to power transmission lines. So, even in promising areas, economically usable sites are few and they are difficult to locate. "" Not only are geothermal places difficult to find, the drilling cost of these sites in a hot, dry and corrosive location is far higher than any other kind of drilling. There are also many very toxic and corrosive materials in the process of geothermal drilling. Arsenic, mercury and ammonia all come with the hot water generated from geothermal and cause many health hazards on a near daily basis. http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com... http://www.energy-consumers-edge.com... Now I will begin to defend my points. My opponent claims that nuclear energy is dangerous to explain. He claims the mining of uranium is very dangerous. I ask him to refer to the following chart on how ""dangerous"" it is. Now, I know people with think of the Chernobyl accident in Russia, but nuclear plants have improved tremendously, and that plant did not even have an upper containment system. Now, no nuclear plant in the world does not have a containment system, and the last major accident of nuclear was pretty much Chernobyl in 1986. Comparing deaths/TWh for all energy sources Energy Source Death Rate (deaths per TWh) Coal – world average 161 (26% of world energy, 50% of electricity) Coal – China 278 Coal – USA 15 Oil 36 (36% of world energy) Natural Gas 4 (21% of world energy) Biofuel/Biomass 12 Peat 12 Solar (rooftop) 0.44 (less than 0.1% of world energy) Wind 0.15 (less than 1% of world energy) Hydro 0.10 (europe death rate, 2.2% of world energy) Hydro - world including Banqiao) 1.4 (about 2500 TWh/yr and 171,000 Banqiao dead) Nuclear 0.04 (5.9% of world energy) *Notice that geothermal is not even included because the percentage where it is actually used is smaller than 0.1%. Uranium mining is just like any other kind of mining and uranium itself is more abundant than gold. The concentration uranium is not high enough to be any danger and there has NEVER been a death related to nuclear radiation in the US EVER. The disposal of nuclear waste has many ways, such as the Yucca mountain idea. However, I personally agree with France's way of reprocessing the nuclear waste so it can be reused and the parts left will become not radioactive in just a few hundred years. Nearly all of the world's largest countries already have access to nuclear energy. All of these countries first made nuclear weapons and then turned to civilian nuclear plants. These plants can be built for countries without nuclear secrets as it has been done before. As long as the plant is for civilian purposes, most countries will agree to build a nuclear plant for a country as a method of producing electricity. http://www.world-nuclear.org... Finally, I will present my second point. Nuclear energy is one of the cheapest energies that can produce a large amount. Nuclear energy costs under 2 cents a kilowatt and the amount of energy one pound of uranium can produce is absolutely tremendous. Nuclear power can be adjusted to produce more energy in on-peak times and less energy in off-peak times and is one of the very few that can keep up with demand in nearly any conditions. Nuclear factories can be mass produced in the world and France currently has more than 75% of its energy from Nuclear. France is a large European country so it is a working example of how nuclear energy can be a suitable replacement from fossil fuels. I ask my opponent to give an example of a country that has more than half or even 40% of its energy produced from geothermal. For nuclear, I can give (over 40%) Armenia, Belgium, France, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine. Germany is currently considering to also go into nuclear power because it can be mass produced and provides energy at a low cost. For the reasons I give above, it is my firm belief that nuclear energy is the best substitute and most viable substitute from fossil fuels. Geothermal simply just does not have that kind of capacity.

S57476c56-A29368e76	government should intervene in the transition to alternative fuels	why the government should intervene more with alternative fuel. people say the market will take care of itself. in the end, it will. but at what cost in the mean time? we should act now because we'll look back and see how much we've wasted on gasoline. companies say they can make alternative biodiesel fuels for a dollar a gallon. (using algae farms, or any organic material, such as switch grass and other things more energy intensive than corn etc.. and exemplified by brazil etc who are energy dependent right now from gas) but, there's a catch 22 occurring. alternative energy companies often must put operations on hold. why? because there's no demand. the consumers who make demand say there's no supply. who can afford as a consumer to buy alternative vehicles? the richer. does the rising prices right now of gasoline hurt them? not as much so they don't buy. but, even if they bought cars sometimes as they are now, there's still not much there in way of an infrastructure for the supply and demand sides. the rich won't start buying more until it really starting hurting them. the poor won't do it cause they can't. the middle won't do it, probably for the same reason. it's conventional wisdom that the rich are the ones who start these new technologies... and the conventional wisdom is probably true here too. but, unlike many situations with conventional wisdom... for alternative fuel, waiting till the rich start the technology isn't in the best interest of the country right now. that's because... unlike for many other things, like buying a DVD player... fuel isn't something that's simply a perk as much, and is a regular and substantial cost for the consumer. it has a noticeable affect on the economy. while we're waiting for the rich to convert, what's happening? in the mean time, the poorer are spending their money on gas, or not being as productive. consider all that money they're spending on that, when they could be spending on an array of other things, going to the economy at large- you could buy a bunch of stuff, and support a bunch of companies, instead of a few companies, gas companies. (and foreigners, which is a major concern in and of itself) to make it more of a practical example. say a new biodiesel machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand. all that money that the poorer are wasting right now would have been more than enough to either subsidize or lend to that station. (you could lend the money to them... and ensue they make a tidy profit before they ever have to pay it back, if ever considering there's a risk they might not make money) if we invested in them as a government then, the effects would be much sooner, and the poorer and middle class would save more, and it'd be a boon to the economy. (plus all the jobs involved with the transitioning infrastructure) government intervention is the way to break the catch 22 sooner when it'll make a difference for the economy, than later when we'll look back and see all that wealth that has been squandered. as to the argument the government should not be 'picking winners'. this is mostly based on the idea that who knows what technology will prevail. biodiesal, electric cars, etc. but, we can act as a hedge, and catalyst. making the companies get a head start to start sorting out the direction the economy should go. i personally would be opposed to a 'Manhattan project' type situation, cause we'd put so much resources into a certain technology that might not even be the best. but we can act as catalysts.

Sf074f877-Ae506fe35	Nuclear Power	"Thanks, Smooosh, for a great debate! I. Breeder Reactors A. The OECD Why did I mention breeder reactors in the first place? I mentioned them as a possible way to solve for the harms of uranium mining pollution. By dropping the OECD evidence, Pro has breeders irrelevant. The OECD evidence shows that, when factoring in direct and indirect emissions (including uranium mining pollution), nuclear power (not just breeders) is cleaner than fossil fuels, biomass, solar, and hydro. The report adds ""[c]umulatively, nearly 60 GtCO2 have been avoided globally since 1971, thanks to nuclear power."" [1] In other words, nuclear power is cleaner than some of the renewables Pro endorses. In fact, Pro repeatedly mentions and defends solar throughout this round. B. Shipment I think it is clear from the text of my argument that I meant the shipment of plutonium and uranium from mines would become rarer. And, in the long term, all types of shipment would become rarer, because after existing stockpiles of these elements are eliminated, the breeder reactors can be converted to become self-sustaining, without the need to new mining operations. C. Plutonium Pro criticizes me for failing to prove that ""nuclear power plants are 100% safe"" from terror. Yet, Pro is quick to say that the plutonium in his world will be ""stored in safe storage facilities, not at the power plants themselves."" Can Pro assure me that those safe storage facilities are 100% safe from terror? Of course not. Pro is imposing an absurd double standard. The real issue is not whether either of us can be 100% safe, but rather whether nuclear power is safe enough that the benefits offset the risks. Moreover, in Pro's world, there will be more net plutonium than in mine. Obviously, if our goal is to minimize the chances of that plutonium falling into the wrong hands, we ought to attempt to destroy it. That means voting Con. On the point about costs, the plutonium from the already existing stores would not require additional refinement. My source explicitly notes that these stockpiles have already been ""purified,"" because they were ""extracted from spent fuel with the intention of using it to power an earlier generation of fast reactors."" [2] Even if they did require refinement, that would only be a temporary expense, as eventually the reactors would become self-sustaining. This gets back to the issue of long-term vs. short-term costs. D. Costs Pro is only focusing on short-term costs. As I said in my last speech: ""overtime, breeder reactors would likely recoup any initial losses by substantially reducing the expenses related to uranium and plutonium mining and shipment. Recall that in breeder reactors, the cost of uranium supplies is reduced 'by more than a factor of 100.'"" Pro never substantively addresses my argument here; he says only that the ""costs will be passed on to consumers."" But again, those costs will only be passed on in the short-term; in the long-term, it should end up saving consumers money. On commercial viability, I would point out that his source cites a single failed breeder reactor from 1966. Again, this is cherry-picked, just like his random example from India. His Japan example wasn't even the fault of the reactor itself--his own source placed the blame for the reactor's failure at the feet of incompetent administrators, not faulty technology. The fact is, nuclear technology has come a long way since 1966, and we're now seeing breeders come into commercial use. As I noted in R3, China, India, and Russia are all pursuing this technology; I even cited the Beloyarsk facility, which employs a commercial breeder reactor. Pro's other source (buzzle--which doesn't seem credible to begin with) is undated, so I cannot know if it reflects every breeder reactor currently in use. The source only says that the breeder reactor is not commercially viable. This seems no different than non-commercially viable renewables or normal nuclear plants, which are all supported by government subsidies. Finally, all of Pro's cost arguments are meaningless if we determine that breeder reactors are worth the expense. Pro writes: ""If we are going to collectively invest in a RENEWABLE, clean energy source, then that is a government investment that I will except."" I have already shown that breeders (a) solve for sustainability--they could fulfill our energy needs for the next 5 billion years (see R3; Pro dropped that argument) and (b) are clean. It seems I've met Pro's own criteria. II. Safety A. Attributable Deaths Pro dropped that ""[n]uclear power kills fewer people per terawatt hour than coal, oil, natural gas, biofuel, peat, rooftop solar, wind, and hydro, averaging just 0.04 deaths per terawatt hour"" (see R2). These hard numbers are going to outweigh all of Pro's speculative comments about Chernobyl. Pro never disputes that only Chernobyl resulted in deaths--not Fukushima, not TMI--and he engages in rhetorical fear-mongering to make the Chernobyl disaster seem as bad as possible. The fact is, Pro doesn't know how bad it was--perhaps it was 100 deaths, or 500. Pro can't tell us. I gave you hard numbers; prefer them over conjecture. Moreover, nuclear pollutes less than solar at the very least (per the OECD data), and so is gaining some advantage there. Pro never contested that nuclear meltdowns are becoming rarer. The time between the first two meltdowns (TMI, Chernobyl) was less than half of the time between the most recent two meltdowns (Chernobyl, Fukushima). Pro has also failed to respond to the argument that Chernobyl only failed due to a design flaw that now, given the flaw's infamy, is unlikely to ever be repeated. B. Drops Add in my medical arguments here. These went entirely conceded throughout the debate. 80% of drugs are tested using radioistopes. You need nuclear reactors to get the right radioisotopes. Pro's world would be a world where 80% of drugs failed to undergo necessary or useful testing. Pro's world would also make conducting CT scans more difficult and deny more than half of US cancer patients needed treatments. That only endangers life. If you use medicine, Pro's world is not the safer one. C. Terrorism Pro dropped a litany of points: (a) the possibility of nuclear terrorism is not unique to my world, (b) HEU is currently being phased out of most reactors in favor of LEU, (c) dirty bombs are not significantly more dangerous than conventional explosives, (d) nuclear meltdowns have historically not been very deadly and (e) people who live near reactors are usually well trained and equipped to respond to a meltdown. Keep in mind too, no nuclear terrorist incident has yet occurred. Terrorists have two options: either steal fissile material to weaponize or trigger a meltdown. Meltdowns haven't been been very deadly in the past, and because employees are background checked and electronic systems are digitally protected, it would be hard to even trigger a meltdown. Also, because LEU is substantially less of a threat and because dirty bombs are not really more dangerous than conventional ones, it doesn't seem like stealing nuclear material would be all that productive for the terrorist either. III. Too Long to Build Pro's decision to merely restate his original argument does nothing to respond to the attacks I made against that argument. There was no internal justification within his source for that 300-400 number. His own source even called for expanding nuclear power--if he trusts the report, he should trust all of it, including its support of my position. That 300-400 number was based, according to Pro, on complete decarbonization by 2050, which is not my advocacy. And, most importantly, Pro entirely drops the example of France, which is a case study in how to do exactly what I am proposing. France proves that my proposal is feasible. IV. Miscellaneous Offense A. Alternatives Pro dropped that renewables are intermittent and require back-up generators, unlike nuclear plants. He conceded that nuclear plants produce substantially more power than alternatives. Both of these factors make nuclear an important part of our energy portfolio; nuclear makes up for renewables' deficits. Pro also talks vaguely about in-home energy sources--but all he does is speculate. He dropped his only concrete example of these (the Powerwall). B. Costs Pro drops the levelized cost data (which isn't specific to breeder reactors). I am therefore showing (by Pro's preferred method) that nuclear reactors are cheaper than fossil fuels, as well as ""biomass, offshore wind, photovoltaic solar, and thermal solar."" Pro also basically drops his bailout argument, saying only that he's a libertarian. But the standard in this debate is cost-benefit analysis, and his personal convictions don't change that. C. Really Miscellaneous Pro drops the stuff about nuclear vehicles and space exploration. At the very least, these offer some kind of benefits. V. Conclusion This debate comes down to weighing the costs against the benefits. In terms of costs, terrorism represents a minimal risk because it is not clear that nuclear plants would enhance their killing ability. Meltdowns rarely produce fatalities and dirty bombs aren't anything to write home about. Breeder reactors may not be good in the short-term, and some vague in-home alternatives may eventually materialize. In terms of benefits, nuclear power kills fewer people per terawatt hour than alternatives, is essential for medical treatments and research, is cheaper than alternatives (per levelized costs), are clean, produce large volumes of energy, could help us explore space, and could help us (via the French model) avert the GW danger threshold. Nuclear is safe, affordable, and useful. The benefits clearly outweigh the costs, and, therefore, we ought not prohibit it. Thus, I negate. VI.

Burden of Proof - The BoP falls equally on both debaters to support and defend their arguments while refuting their opponent's. For example, Con can focus on negative effects to the environment, safety issues, or better alternatives rendering Nuclear obsolete, but Con cannot just disagree with everything Pro puts up (and vise versa). I will go ahead and present some definitions. Unless Con finds these definitions to be abusive, they are to be accepted. If Con finds them abusive, Con is free to present alternative definitions, but then it will be up to the voters to agree if my definitions are abusive or not. Nuclear energy (as it pertains to this debate) - The gathering of energy from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion to use in commercial purposes (such as electricity). Nuclear fission - A nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits spontaneously or on impact with another particle, with the release of energy. [1] Nuclear fusion - A nuclear reaction in which atomic nuclei of low atomic number fuse to form a heavier nucleus with the release of energy.

Scf368ef2-Ac79e6454	ODT: The U.S. should increase its nuclear energy development.	"C1: Nuclear Power Plants have a risk of High Environmental and Societal Damage [1][2] My opponent essentially argues that accidents happen which harm the environment and society with nuclear energy. Twith this analysis is that its comparatively non-unique to other forms of energy especially oil and fails to take into account technological advances. I don’t need to remind everyone about the BP oil spill in the gulf and various other oil disasters. Just because a risk exists does not mean one should not pursue the beneficial goal nor try and minimize the risks. Weinburg in, Social Institutions and Nuclear Energy, points out that the disasters of nuclear energy (1) are rare in comparison to other energy disasters, there has really been only 3 disasters in the whole history of nuclear energy but more importantly (2) those disasters would most likely not occur in the United States due to immense safety precautions, oversight that would exist and technological advances in safety measures. Moore, a founding member of Greenpeace writes: ""The multi-agency U.N. Chernobyl Forum reported last year that 56 deaths could be directly attributed to the accident, most of those from radiation or burns suffered while fighting the fire. Tragic as those deaths were, they pale in comparison to the more than 5,000 coal-mining deaths that occur worldwide every year."" Thus, comparatively nuclear energy is much safer and my advocacy would eventually lead to a mass decrease in the need for coal and oil since there would be a reduction in demand. As such, nuclear energy’s minor risks subsume the higher risked fossil fuel ventures. C2: Nuclear Power Plants are Uneconomical [3] My opponent makes a few errors in his economic analysis: First, my opponent is solely looking at costs and not gains. From the analysis I provided on France above, it demonstrates that the economic benefits very much outweigh the costs. The majority of costs are in the beginning stages of development, which is a non-issue since one wouldn’t build a nuclear facility unless has the funds to do it, and at decommissioning which as the evidence indicates is subsumed by the capital gained when exporting energy from the nuclear facility. The WNA study, “In assessing the economics of nuclear power, decommissioning and waste disposal costs are fully taken into account… they [decommissioning and waste] contribute only a few percent to the investment cost and even less to the generation cost. In the USA they account for 0.1-0.2 cent/kWh, which is no more than 5% of the cost of the electricity produced. The study concludes that when analyzing all the major countries which use nuclear energy the economic benefits of exporting nuclear energy has both the economic effect of cheap and abundant energy, but also an economically sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. The company in the majority of cases always are economically green (the company subsumes the initial costs). The study also indicates that there are plenty of opportunities for tax assistance and private assistance in the nuclear energy field which helps bring down the initial investment cost. Second, it is good for the economy because as my opponent indicates it will hire people and other companies for the building and maintenance of the facility. This isn’t a bad thing as my opponent tries to indicate. If he believes this is a bad thing he must provide the appropriate analysis, which he has not done. Third, his analysis of uranium is false. The evidence indicates that uranium is actually abundant and relatively cheap in comparison to other fuel sources. C3: No Fossil Fuel Independence [4] My opponent argues that even with nuclear energy we would still need to use fossil fuels for power, transportation etc. The problem with this argument is that it mistakes a huge reduction in the use of fossil fuels, with a utopian unconditional independence from fossil fuels. Under my opponent’s advocacy there will be zero action taken to make us independent, but under my advocacy we are at least doing something to reduce our dependence. And, from an environmental standpoint nuclear makes all the difference. Schultz writes, “Roughly 700 million metric tons of CO2 emissions are avoided each year in the United States by generating electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, that is nearly equivalent to the CO2 released from all U.S. passenger ­cars.” 90% of our power is taken from fossil fuels, the 5% produced from nuclear already equalizes that of all cars in the U.S.; under this comparison no matter what fossil fuels are needed to initially start the process, having the U.S. increase its production from 5 to say 20%, 30% or 40% the amount of environmentally deadly fumes and C02 would be reduced outweighs the initial amount by an inconceivable number. Moreover, my opponents claim that solar and wind are better is completely false. His argument negates this claim: to build wind and solar energy devices transportation and initial building would still use fossil fuels. The importance is that both systems inevitably reduce the overall need for fossil fuels. Source Critique My opponent foresaw my objection to his use of Wikipedia. It is ok to use Wikipedia one or two times to reference statistics or such but using Wikipedia as your only source is absurd. Wikipedia is unreliable due to user interpretation of the texts and essays and worse even manipulation of the arguments in the texts. I won’t object to Wikipedia on the argumentation level, though I ask the readers to highly evaluate using just Wikipedia as a misuse of a source. [1] Weinburg. Social Institutions and Nuclear Energy.

There is an unrealistic focus on nuclear power as a magical solution to climate change. Despite increasing demand the amount of electricity being generated by nuclear is projected to fall not rise. The share of nuclear energy will decrease from 30% to 25% in electricity generation by 2020. According to current projections, the nuclear generation capacity in the EU would fall by as much as 33 GWe by 2020; this fall would mostly have to be met by dirty power plants using gas, or particularly coal [1]. The focus on nuclear power diverts attention from other renewables. In reality going nuclear would squeeze out renewables. Indeed, the former Secretary of State for Business Patricia Hewitt said in a Commons debate on a 2003 Energy White Paper: 'It would have been foolish to announce …. that we would embark on a new generation of nuclear power stations because that would have guaranteed that we would not make the necessary investment and effort in both energy efficiency and in renewables'[2].

Sb3cf5511-Abeeb2b59	Resolved: On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks.	"I affirm Resolved: On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks. To win this debate, I only need to show that, in general principles (on balance), the benefits associated with nuclear power as a whole outweigh the risks of the technology. For example, Three Mile Island is an atypical example of nuclear power as a whole, and is therefore not an accurate way to frame this debate. I will now first address my opponent's case before introducing my own. 1. Construction Costs: Listing two or three examples is not an accurate representation of the nuclear industry as a whole. The average nuclear power plant is in fact extremely beneficial to local economies, resulting in a net economic gain that far exceeds construction costs. The numbers speak for themselves: the average nuclear plant generates 400-700 permanent jobs, $20 million in total state and local tax revenue, $75 in federal tax payments, and nearly $430 million in local economic output annually. [(1) http://flv.texasgulfcoastonline.com...] Considering that the life of a typical nuclear reactor is 30-40 years, total community economic output ($430,000,000 x 30, $430,000,000 x 40) amounts to $12.9-17.2 billion. This exceeds the already atypical $8 billion in start-up costs cited by my opponent. [(2) http://www.iaea.org...] Therefore, the typical economic benefits of a nuclear power plant are greater than the economic investment. 2. Health Effects This seems to be the structure of Con's argument: P1: Exposure to a lot of radiation is detrimental one's health. P2: There's a lot of radiation at nuclear power plants. C: Therefore, working at a nuclear power plant is detrimental to one's health. While nuclear power plants obviously have higher radiation levels than surrounding environments, my opponent only cites health detriments to extreme amounts of radiation exposure, without regard to the amount actually present at power plants. From the New York Times, March 14, 2011 [(3) http://www.nytimes.com...]: ""[I]n the United States the usual radiation exposure limit for nuclear power plant workers is 50 millisieverts, or 5 rem, per year (compared with the 0.3 rem that the Environmental Protection Agency says most people get from normal background radiation). When there is an emergency, the limit can be raised to 25 rem, which is still far below the level at which people would show symptoms or get sick."" Radiation exposure is further mitigated by the fact that in areas with the most potential for exposure, workers wear full-body suits and/or take shifts to reduce the intensity of absorption. Concerns for surrounding communities are also alleviated in that emissions by nuclear plants into environmental surroundings are insignificant compared to natural levels already present [(4) http://www.heritage.org...]. If my opponent really wants to get into human health and its relation to nuclear power plants, it is worth noting that most plant workers are unionized and generally receive health insurance and other benefits, as well as exercise on the job [(5) http://centralny.ynn.com...]. 3. Meltdowns Con cites only two meltdown scenarios (Chernobyl and Three Mile Island) to justify the inherent risks of nuclear power. Today, such concerns are unfounded. Modern nuclear reactors are free from the design flaws that caused the Chernobyl plant to explode, and reactors now have multiple containment cores to prevent the escape of nuclear material even if an accident does occur [(6) http://discovermagazine.com...]. The Three Mile island meltdown was also contained, and no detrimental health effects have been reported. Today's water reactors, which slow neuron emissions to keep reaction rates steady, make major meltdowns extremely improbable [6]. Regarding storage, my opponent admits that storing nuclear waste in steel and concrete casks is optimal, but that Congress has not acted on such proposals. This has nothing to do with the risks of nuclear waste, which can in fact be stored safely, but rather the ineptitude of Congress itself. This point should be dropped from the round. When stored in steel and concrete casks, uranium waste can be stored for at least a century, and can often be recycled to meet future energy needs., In fact, an amount the volume of one's fingertip posseses the energy potential of 1,780 pounds of coal [6]. Such uranium is useful, efficient, and can be stored safely. 4. Terrorism Contrary to my opponent's claims, modern plants are built to survive a terrorist attack. Plants are built to withstand the impact of a passenger airplane [1]. Further, if pilots are caught loitering over nuclear sites, the FAA has a policy of detaining and interrogating those responsible [4]. Con claims that terrorists have an incentive to attack nuclear power plants, but terrorists also have an incentive to attack oil rigs, atomic testing sites, and the White House. As Jack Spencer of the Heritage Foundation explains, ""A successful terrorist attack against a nuclear power plant could have severe consequences, as would attacks on schools, chemical plants, or ports. However, fear of a terrorist attack is not a sufficient reason to deny society access to any of these critical assets"" [4]. At the point where my opponent never quantifies the likelihood of a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility, he is only operating on a ""what-if"" scenario without gauging either the intent of terrorist groups or the likelihood that they could even conduct a successful attack. In my case I will provide turn this point, showing that nuclear power actually reduces terrorist activity, thereby shifting this voting issue over to Pro side. Now for my case... 1. Nuclear Energy is the Best Way to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions Total emissions over the life of a nuclear plant (including uranium mining, shipping, construction, etc.) are about the same as hydroelectric plants and wind farms, and emit less carbon dioxide than solar plants. The efficiency of nuclear power (the energy potential of 1,780 pounds of coal in an area the size of a fingertip) plus the overall positive economic impact of power plants makes nuclear energy the best renewable energy option for the United States. 2. Nuclear Energy Reduces Terrorism Nuclear energy reduces U.S. dependence on oil from nations that continue to enable terrorist regimes. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""One of the biggest dangers to our security is from oil nations providing support to anti-U.S. terrorist groups. The faster we can move away from carbon-based energy, the faster we take away that funding source"" [(7) http://online.wsj.com...]. Nuclear energy reduces U.S. oil dependence on nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, the latter of which uses Iran to funnel weapons directly to Hezbollah [(8) http://www.cfr.org...]. Nuclear power also reduces nuclear proliferation by terrorists. Atomic warheads are excellent as reactor fuel, and currently amount to 15% of world nuclear fuel. Expanding the use of nuclear energy and the resulting increased demand for reactor fuel will divert warheads away from terrorist groups, reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism against the U.S. [(9) http://www.spiked-online.com...]. Conclusion Nuclear energy is a safe, reliable and efficient way for the United States to become energy independent while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating terrorist threats. The harms proposed by my opponent are insignificant if not nonexistant. On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks. The resolution is affirmed."	PRO	303
Scf368ef2-A3a6d9bb4	ODT: The U.S. should increase its nuclear energy development.	As this is a debate with an equal BOP, I assume we go with a normal 4 round Format R1) Acceptance and Definitions R2) Contention R3) Rebuttals R4) Closing Arguments C1: Nuclear Power Plants have a risk of High Environmental and Societal Damage [1][2] Nuclear Power Plants always come at a high risk for a disaster. Almost any environmental change or Natural Disaster could lead to the plant not producing nearly as much energy, could close the plant, or, even worse, could leak out radiation. This was seen recently with the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster last year. Some, but not all of the environmental changes and natural disasters that would alter Nuclear Power Plants are: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tropical Depressions/Storms/Hurricanes, Heat Waves, Reduced Precipitation Levels, Tornadoes, and Hurricanes.These environmental changes and natural disasters occur almost every place in the United States[3]. Seawater is also highly corrosive to Nuclear Power Plants, so it is Extremely Dangerous to put it on an ocean coast. Nuclear Power Plants themselves don't produce CO2, but all other parts of the Nuclear Fuel Chain, mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management, all require Fossil Fuels, hence those other parts all produce CO2. Also, it would be quite a challenge to dispose even more Nuclear Waste. Decommissioning the plant safely would be occupationally dangerous, as would working in a Nuclear Power Plant. C2: Nuclear Power Plants are Uneconomical[1][2] Nuclear Power Plants require high capital costs to build them. True, during the expected Nuclear Power Plant lifetime of 60 years, that Nuclear Energy is cheap itself, but you have to also pay all of the workers, and you would have to pay them a lot, since you are working with Uranium. It also requires money and Fossil Fuels to fulfill the rest of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle. Once the Nuclear Energy stops producing energy, Nuclear Plants have to go through a process of Decommisioning, which normally costs $300 Million-$5 Billion per plant, as you have to pay the workers to decommision the plant, and you have to fulfill certain standards to decommision, which also requires a lot of money. The process of Decommisioning also takes a long time, as no Nuclear Plant in the U.S. has finished Decommisioning. C3: No Fossil Fuel Independence[2] America has recently been trying to break away from Fossil Fuels. Nuclear Energy would not give us Fossil Fuel Independence. All other parts of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle require Fossil Fuels to run. Therefore, we still have to pay money to import oil and other Fossil Fuels from other countries. Nuclear Energy is not the way to break away from Fossil Fuels. Other power sources break away from Fossil Fuels, such as Wind Turbines and Solar Panels[4][5] Sources: [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org...

S53275be8-A27bfb06a	Nuclear power gives countries energy security and self-sufficiency	There is almost always one renewable resource that a given country can exploit with sufficient investment; tides for islands, the sun for equatorial countries, hot rocks for volcanic regions. Any given country can in principle become self-sufficient in terms of renewable energy. The global distribution of uranium is hugely uneven (much more so than fossil fuels) and the use of nuclear power therefore gives countries with uranium deposits disproportionate economic power. Kazakhstan became the world's number one supplier of uranium in 2009, and other major producers such as Russia, Namibia, Niger and Uzbekistan may not be reliable1. It is far from inconceivable that uranium could be subject to the same kind of monopoly that the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) places on oil. 1'Kazakhstan plans to become global leader in uranium production by 2009', Silk Road Intelligencer, 23rd July 2008,	CON	305

S3b786af9-A5be0b452	Nuclear Power Vs. Solar Power (Future Electrical Needs)	To start this debate, I will begin by fabricating a nuclear power plant, and a solar array for comparison purposes. El-Cheapo Nuclear Plant (1,2,3,4) Gross Power Capacity 1500 Megawatts (1443 Sustained 24/7) Capacity Factor 91.2% Cost to build ($5500/kWh*1500000) = $8.5 Billion+$300 Million Decommissioning Fund Life Span 45-60 Years Giga-watts produced per year (1.5 per hour*91.2% capacity factor*24 hours*365 days)=11900gWh Giga-watts produced over plant life span=535,000-714,000 Cost per Mega-watt over lifespan (8,800,000,000/535,000,000)=$16.44 El-Cheapo Solar Plant (2,5,6) Gross Power Capacity 1500 Megawatts Capacity Factor 17% (Average of Massachusetts-(15%) and Arizona-(19%) Capacity Factor) Cost To Build ($.74/watt *1.5 billion watts +50% for installation) 1.665 billion Life Span 20-30 years Giga-watts produced per year(1.5 per hour*17% capacity factor*24 hours*365 days)=2250gWh Giga-watts produced over plant life span=45,000-67,500 Cost Per Megawatt over lifespan (1,665,000,000/45,000,000)=$37 Arguments Cost: A Nuclear Power Plant will cost less than half of a comparable solar power plant per megawatt. Even factoring in fuel, security and maintenance, nuclear power costs about 4 cents per kWh, and solar power costs 22 cents per kWh produced (7). This means that if nuclear power were more widely used, it would cut energy costs for businesses to 18% of what their bills would be if solar power were more widely used. Capacity: It would take more than five el-cheapo solar plants to produce the same average energy as one el-cheapo nuclear plant. Energy is not needed only when the sun is shining, but also at night, meaning that for solar power to be a feasible alternative, dozens of Giga-watt battery arrays would have to be built, further driving up the price of solar energy. Not only that, but what do you do about several cloudy or rainy days in a row? However, a nuclear plant can simply run at full load all night or during cloudy/rainy days. Life Span: A nuclear power plant can be used for twice as long as a solar plant. Why build 2 solar plants over 60 years if you could just build one cheaper, more reliable nuclear plant? Safety record: Events such as Chernobyl and the Fukushima disaster gives nuclear power in the United States a bad name. Nuclear power ranks among the safest industries in America (8), for 2008, the industry hit a new low of 0.13 industrial accidents per 200,000 worker-hours, as compared to 1.3 per 200,000 worker hours in all private industries. I do not wish to get overly technical with reactor safety, but the Fukushima, and Chernobyl reactors were not in the same league of safety as American reactors. The Fukushima reactors had a containment dome capable of withstanding 60psi of internal pressure, whereas United States Reactors can withstand up to 200psi, and the force of a commercial-airliner crashing into them. Also remember the Chernobyl power plants used a ludicrously stupid graphite rod assembly (I would need 20,000 characters to explain why) which caused a reactor meltdown. Also, remember, the Japanese placed their emergency backup generators and pumps below sea level! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission would never approve this system (9,10,11,12) Nuclear Waste: Nuclear Waste could easily be disposed at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which was deemed safe for 1,000,000 years, however it was closed and defunded by the Obama administration for “political, not technical or safety reasons” (13). So the nuclear waste problem can be solved, but Washington refuses to act upon it. Land Use: It would take almost 20 square miles to build a 1500-megawatt solar plant, however a 1500-megawatt nuclear plant only takes 3 square miles. The nuclear plant therefore further reduced environmental ramifications for animals, by disturbing fewer habitats (1,14). I have shown that nuclear power is safe, cheaper than solar power, more durable than solar power, and more feasible than large-scale solar power, good luck to my opponent.

Sf074f877-Acb2d84fb	Nuclear Power	"Breeder reactors are a pipe dream!!!!!! I'm perplexed by my opponents claim that ""ship(ment of) plutonium would be a rare event"". Plutonium is the by-product of the nuclear reaction process, it is essentially nuclear waste. Most of the worlds plutonium is stored in safe storage facilities, not at the power plants themselves. My opponent claims that fast breeder reactors can reduce the worlds plutonium supply, and he claims that shipping would be a rare event. For the breeder reactors to reduce the worlds plutonium supply, all the plutonium would need to be shipped to said reactors. The claim that shipping of plutonium would be rare, is entirely false. Furthermore, as I've pointed out before, this plutonium is not reactor ready, it needs an extra process of fusion with a heavy metal before it could be used in a breeder reactor. This extra process is an industrial sized task, which would require specialized processing plants, which would compound the already outrageously high price of the breeder reactors themselves. After the plutonium fusion process, there is a radioactive salt residue left behind. The nulclear industry has no plans in place to deal with the residue, and doesn't even speak of the residue for that matter. It would probably need to be stored away in a safe facility for hundreds of thousands of years. There is also the fact that this reprocessed plutonium is a very pure form of plutonium, and it would cause untold devestation if it were involved in an accident during shipment. This very pure plutonium would be exactly what a terrorist would need to build a true nuclear bomb. https://www.google.com.... The idea of breeder reactors being used commercially, borders on pseudo science, or science fiction. I challenge my opponent to answer one simple question. IF BREEDER REACTORS HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE 1943, WHY ARE THEY NOT IN WIDESPREAD COMMERCIAL USE TODAY? In my oppinion the high cost, (which is estimated at 4 to 8 billion dollars) and the time it takes to make these reactors, coupled with technical difficulties that still have yet to be completely worked out, make these reactors an expensive option at best. Furthermore, any potential accident of a breeder reactor could make Chernobyl look like a nice walk in the park. http://www.freep.com.... This statement is irrefutable: there has never been a commercially successful breeder reactor. Yes, there are a few breeder reactors in use today, but they are experiments in the economic feasibility of breeder reactors, which many countries have tried in the past, but all have failed. http://www.buzzle.com.... My opponent claims that the high cost of breeder reactor development is different than implementation of those reactors. I find that argument holds no water, because the cost of developing those reactors will be passed onto the consumers, or the taxpayers. The nulclear industry are not going to eat the losses out of the kindness of their hearts, someone will have to pay for it. Proponents of fast burning breeder reactors, and waste annihilating molten salt reactors, and any other experimental reactors will still try and push the need for further investment in the nuclear industry, even in lieu of all the evidence that nuclear waste reuse is expensive and dangerous. The only argument these proponents are left with, sounds more like a threat than a credible argument when they say, it's the only option we have to get rid of the worlds nulclear waste. So, what there trying to say is, WE have to pay for cleaning up the nuclear industries waste!?! I think that WE as a society are smart enough to not be intimidated or fooled by the nuclear industry any longer!!! Invest in renewables instead!!!!!!! There seems to be alot of back and fourth about government investment (bailouts) in this debate, and I'm not willing to let that die. My opponents argument relies heavily on the fact that renewables rely on goverment subsidies. I'm a libertarian, so the idea of any government subsidies sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me, but there is an energy crisis looming, our energy consumption is polluting our earth, and we need to deal with it. If we are going to collectively invest in a RENEWABLE, clean energy source, then that is a government investment that I will except. If we will continue to invest in an industry that leaves behind a toxic pollution that remains for hundreds of thousands of years, and there method of waste clean-up is unproven and underdeveloped, then that's unacceptable in my mind. I've provided evidence that renewable energy costs are continuously falling, while renewable energy efficiency is continuously rising. My opponent does nothing to show that nuclear energy costs are falling, or even stable, only to say that government investment in nulclear energy is what's needed for stabilizing costs. Prove nuclear power is safe!!!!! My opponent will need to show that reprocessing plutonium into the very pure strain needed for use in a breeder reactor, and then shipping that plutonium, is not dangerous. This highly pure strain of plutonium is exactly what a terrorist would need ""to make a true nuclear bomb"". The best method for keeping the ingredients of a true nuclear bomb out of the hands of terrorists, would be to not reprocess the plutonium, and abandon nuclear power altogether. My opponent fails to prove that nuclear power plants are 100% safe from cyber-terrorism or infiltration by force. All my opponent can offer as a rebuttal to this point is the fact that it hasn't happened in the past. I brought up the fact that US and Russian intelligence both consider a nuclear terrorist attack inevitable. My opponent opponent didn't even touch the fact that the UN and WHO both concluded that the true death toll of Chernobyl can never truly be known because radiation sickness can sometimes takes years or decades to kill someone, therefore can't be directly linked to Chernobyl, even though the initial radiation poisoning may have caused the death. My opponent shows a rather complacent attitude toward the possibility of a nuclear accident. Given the fact that major meltdowns have taken place in the past, proves it can happen again. My opponent also entirely dropped the point I made that, since most nuclear power plants are built by water, the possibility of an accident (flood at a nuclear power plant) is elevated, especially in lieu of rising sea levels and more frequent and more powerful storms. Nuclear power cannot impact greenhouse gas emissions in time!!!!!!!! I brought up the fact that the US National Commission of Energy estimates that the US would need to build 300 to 400 reactors before 2050 to make an appreciable impact on greenhouse gas emissions. I think his rebuttal missed the point entirely. That would mean 10 reactors a year for the next 30 years.

S2f07394f-A51393d53	America should expand nuclear energy production.	"I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said. 1) My opponent never really attacks my first contention about how this has worked in other countries so that still stands. 2) My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters saying that plants could be breached but the American power plants were not damaged. He also makes note of the disaster in Japan. (1) This was not because of a problem with Nuclear reactors but a problem in withholding high standards. These standards are getting met by the U.S.A. and no nuclear damage from sandy is proof. 3) If several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount. (2) Once built, nuclear power plants have advantages. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. So firms and consumers are very exposed to the wholesale price of gas.But at a nuclear power plant, the fuel is processed uranium, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production. While it may cost more to build it will be a good investment for the future.(3) My opponent says that the exuberant cost is a huge deal.(2)(3) This shows that nuclear power is able to be built for much less than what he has stated. This also shows that once it is built it is far more effective. He states that there is a very large safety issue with nuclear energy.(sorry for the long chart)(4) Coal "" global average 170,000 (50% global electricity) Coal "" China 280,000 (75% China""s electricity) Coal "" U.S. 15,000 (44% U.S. electricity) Oil 36,000 (36% of energy, 8% of electricity) Natural Gas 4,000 (20% global electricity) Biofuel/Biomass 24,000 (21% global energy) Solar (rooftop) 440 (< 1% global electricity) Wind 150 (~ 1% global electricity) Hydro "" global average 1,400 (15% global electricity) Nuclear "" global average 90 (17% global electricity w/Chern&Fukush) As shown by this chart nuclear energy s by far the most efficient in energy per deaths. If it has the most energy per life lost it is the safest. I also use this rebuttal vs the waste management as it is causing next to no damage. My opponent never says anything that could take over the role of nuclear besides more gas and when we already have to import almost half of our oil this is not the right step.

Scb08147e-A1c1faafc	"the proper versus current approach to ""alternative fuels"""	"Don't you have a rule that when people insult you they instantly lose? I expect your resignation next round. (not really) A fuel that can replace gasoline in its entirety forever- electric energy. Preferably electric energy derived from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, wave, tidal energy sources. However, even if derived from just coal it actually ends up putting less pollution into the atmosphere (still). * You misapprehend the battery comment. We make hydrogen by splitting water. By the second law of thermodynamics the energy in the hydrogen is necessarily less than the energy we used to split the water. That doesn't make it a fuel. That makes it an energy storage substance. Other than from other energy sources (electric, natural gas) where do we get hydrogen? * Green energy, renewable energies and carbon neutral energies are all needed to not only reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, foreign energy sources, but also needed to prevent and slow the progress of global warming and climate change. * ""Primarily right now hydrogen is produced through reformation of methane"" -- You cannot scale that. It can be done, but cannot be scaled to any degree. Methane is a fossil fuel, one which we have about 50 years worth remaining and certainly cannot be a permanent replacement. That process produces twice as much CO2 as hydrogen (by the chemistry). * Regardless of the manner of electrolysis the end result is the same, less energy than it took to make is in the resulting product. That's just basic physics. For the sake of argument, I'll let you say you have perfectly efficient electrolysis, which is to say you have exactly as much energy in the hydrogen as you used on the water. -- That's a glorified battery! * Unlike a real battery however, you have no ability to store more energy. Battery technology has high potentials to store far more energy than we currently have in a tank of gas. Supercapacitors, better materials, faster charges, new technology... the possibility of innovation here is quite large. Batteries can be improved. The recharge time has been improved on a Toshiba batter. 90% in five minutes. http://www.dailytech.com... Cheap Li-ion batteries: http://www.popularmechanics.com... Nanotech advancement 10x battery life: http://www.news.com... And potentials to advance completely away from batteries to capacitors. http://www.spectrum.ieee.org... We are dealing with storing energy in either chemical form or in the electric field of a capacitor. That's pretty limitless and allows for massive amounts of innovation. * Being messy and tiny and leaky is far is not discredited by your comment of it being the ""cleanest"". Frankly, it's not. To get the hydrogen you're using actual energy. Just because it's a fairly green battery doesn't mean it's green energy. If you filled a building filled with hydrogen rupture it it might well just leave a giant hole in the ground if anything sparks. * We used the water to make hydrogen. The fact that hydrogen burns into water again is just confirming what I said in my intro... glorified battery. * I ignored the embrittle problem and certain other problems as they are simply small technological hurdles. I think however, the fact that it leaks all the time (think a 2-day old helium balloon) is problematic. * You cannot hijack the natural gas infrastructure. First, it will leak! Secondly, we use that for natural gas! My stove isn't set to run on a hydrogen and natural gas mix. My water heater, dryer, my heater they aren't either. Am I to forgo my use of natural gas in order to have leaky hydrogen to power a car which cannot pressurize the gas itself? We only have so much natural gas, and that's only while we're using it at the rates we're using it. Power cars with the stuff would drop our amount of natural gas and drive up the price. And we'd end up with electrolysis (which scales). * If you wanted to convert cars over to run on natural gas, that is something to be independently discussed. As is, you're arguing that one gas is pretty much another. And though we currently use natural gas in things made for natural gas. * Building the infrastructure is an acceptable ideas. Though, here we are faced with a catch-22. Do we build the infrastructure first or the cars first? How much infrastructure do we produce before the cars and who foots the bill if it doesn't work? Though, I assume that will be overcome. * Not a hazmat team to deal with a crash, but rather a well trained group of firefighters who know where they should not use the jaws of life to cut you out of that? How to detect a hydrogen leak, and what the risks are involved when different parts rupture or the car catches on fire. * I've seen them at car-shows but other than that I've seen them nowhere. * I do not typify the ""non-scientific liberal reaction to hydrogen"" -- the fact of the matter is that hydrogen has a large amount of following within the liberal community. My objection however is simply a scientific understanding that hydrogen is just a glorified battery and not a very good one at that. * Converting the power grid to carbon neutral profile is certainly a requirement to moving forward with energy today. Global warming is not our friend. We need to switch to carbon neutral sources of power (hydrogen is not a source) sooner rather than later. * I am strongly pro-nuclear. I am pro-science and the science behind nuclear is sound. * I never advocated ethanol, at least not corn ethanol. Sugar ethanol works well as it's a biproduct and works out quite effectively and doesn't replace food. * I said 2nd law because that's what prevented it. 0,1,3 weren't mentioned as they weren't needed. -- My solution (which isn't needed for the topic) is plug in hybrid cars, which transition to electric as the technology does. * The EV1 wasn't a failure, GM just recalled all the cars and forcibly scrapped the project (they didn't want politicians forcing them to make electric cars), see ""Who Killed the Electric Car"". Further, there are cars being put out all the time. Tesla Roadster - http://www.topspeed.com... There is massive potential for increases in technology here, whereas you're scrambling with ""just build the infrastructure"" or ""we'll use this fossil fuel instead. Plug-in hybrids and electric cars are on the road today. * For quick charge comment see Toshiba. Further, supercapacitors would have the ability to charge in a few seconds (you don't want to do that/might as well be lightning). * Hydrogen has less energy density than gasoline. Pure liquid hydrogen has less hydrogen than gasoline (the molecules pack the energy better than simple pressurization). * There's no room for advancement when you're dealing with chemicals. But, take a look at cell-phones. The charge time, the battery technology, the rather continual and gradual improvement. That's what we need in a car technology. Hydrogen has nothing behind it, and it can't scale. --- Your calculations about the ""price per gallon"" were flawed. The wikipedia page on the Toyota Prius (which I assume you used) didn't say the energy use was 100kwh. Rather it was saying the current limit to drive range was 7 miles in all electric mode up-bounded by the speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The range limit is low because batteries aren't designed for electric only mode and this is not a plug-in or electric model. The batteries only store about 1.3 kwh of power. Which by the way, works out to 0.185 kilowatt / mile or 2.8 cents a mile. That's 37% less than gasoline at $3.00 or $1.11 dollars a gallon."	CON	310
S78068d61-Adc6cdc94	Nuclear power should be banned	"Before I start I would to point out we are debating the energy source of nuclear power, not the weapons. (see definitions and visual) C1: Nuclear power is a green energy Nuclear power is regulated by the epa [1] It has no emissions when in the fission process, and the ""smoke"" is actually steam. [1, 2] It only emits population indirectly (mining uranium). Although not renewable, it is sustainable and green. [2, 3] Some newer in development reactors are are very sustainable and would power us for 5 billion years! [2, 4] That is the lifetime of the sun btw. [5] Another type of reactor takes the uranium from sea water, and this amount replenishes and never runs out, so would in fact be essentially renewable. [3, 6] One misconception is the waste is bad for the environment. The waste is easily containable and actually is being safely contained today. [7] Nuclear power is clean, and this is comparable to other power sources like solar, but function at much more higher efficiencies. [7] Also the goverment is pressing for greener energies, and nuclear is on the page for a green energy. [8] Now, the claims about nuclear power being dirty is false as they cannot emit CO2 and other gases directly, and if need be I will pull up stats showing they even emmits less then solar! C2: Safety of nuclear power Nuclear power plants are very durable and rarely break down, and their safety record compares to other energies. [9, 10] One argument is terrorists attacks, they have safeguards preventing this and other security systems. [9] Also its never happened. [9] Also the plant will not explode as the uranium is only enriched to a 5% level. Their newer reactors usually have competent workers and are safe when the workers do their ""thing"". [11] The safety of nuclear power is great! Future development keeps plants safer and even more reliable. [15] Banning it would mean stopping production and advancements while we take the long amount of time to take them down. This means the power will become more dangerous while the deconstructions begin as they will be old models. Keeping it going means they get safer. C3: Cost Nuclear power is comparable to other cheap forms of energy. [12] The actual fuel costs for nuclear power are relatively small. [12] The costs of nuclear power re cheaper then coal (a cheap power source), natural gas, and oil/ [12] Nuclear power currency supplies 1% of the worlds energy at low costs. [13] The plants are cheap to operate and are only costly when building the plant. [13] Nuclear power competes in prices with all energy forms as nuclear production is cheap. [13] People are making thorium nuclear power which CANNOT melt down ever or be weaponized. They are also cheap. [14] These new plants mean the future of nuclear power will be cheaper and safer. [14] Nuclear power is 25% cheaper then coal and less then 25% if the cost of gas. [16] C4: Jobs The nuclear industry is expanding, even in the bad economy. [17] One nuclear power plant alone hires 1-2000 people. [17] And others in temporary building procedures. [17] Not only is this power green and safe, but would create thousands of jobs in the US. [18] In Canada alone they employ 66,000 people. [19] ---> Conclusion Need I say more? Nuclear power ought to be allowed as one of the green energies of america. Sources: http://www.epa.gov...

I believe that the United States of America should increase the nuclear energy production for the following reasons. It has worked in other countries, It is not nearly as deadly as people say, America needs the energy and this is a cost efficient option. 1) For my first argument I would like to point to France. They are getting 77.7 of their energy from nuclear energy. (1)France is fine and they are using nuclear energy effectively and have had less negative environmental impacts than oil coal and other fossil fuels. This is something that America can move into as we do have examples and could follow Frances nuclear code as they have not had any huge nuclear problems. 2) The cleanest energy(3)(4) is by far nuclear power. We are not harming the environment and we are losing less lives than if we used different energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is the most cost efficient energy in the United States. (2)We are at a time where we are in a state of extreme national debt and the cheapest energy option is by far the best. (5) We are importing 45% of our foreign oil and this is costing way more than the nuclear energy. Nuclear energy can fill this gap in energy production. The cheapest energy and the cleanest energy is the obvious choice.(3) Conclusion: Nuclear energy has proved itself by working in France as well as acting as the cheapest and the cleanest energy we have available.

Seaed4f92-A4a5bf573	Nuclear power plants should be torn down forever	"""Cost is also one of the major disadvantages of nuclear energy. It costs between three and five billion dollars just to build a nuclear power plant. Maintenance and operating costs are also high because lots of money must be sent on safety systems in case something goes wrong."" This is entirely wrong. Nuclear power generators are expected to cost $18 billion by 2013 However the coal and gas industry will cost $85 billion by the same time. Which would you rather pay taxes for? ""2.One of the most feared disadvantages of nuclear energy is the potential for weapons. Each year, every nuclear reactor is capable of making enough plutonium to build over thirty nuclear bombs.

I look forward to your argument,Con Add me! Uh yes. Again we don't have a better alternative. Look Nuclear power is not as dangerous as the hippies thought it was. Want proof? The U.S Navy developed nuclear power for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers. To this day they have an unblemished record in nuclear safety. So its cheaper, last longer and doesn't pollute the air that we breathe, yet you want to ban it because of one major incident more than 20 years ago? So what do we do then, when the world's supply of fossil fuels is exhausted. And that's in about 50 years. Nuclear power IS the future. Good debate pro.

S53275be8-Aebc09859	Nuclear power is clean and emits significantly less CO2 than other renewable energy sources	"In many senses nuclear energy is the cleanest of renewables. It does not produce emissions such as CO2 and greenhouse gases, which are harmful to the population and the environment. Roughly 700 million metric tons of CO2 emissions are avoided each year in the United States by generating electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source; according to the U.S. Department of Energy, that is nearly equivalent to the CO2 released from all U.S. passenger cars[1]. It is true that it does produce radioactive waste but since this is in solid form it can be dealt with relatively easily and stored away from centres of population. Furthermore, as new technology becomes available to allow the more efficient use of nuclear fuel, less nuclear waste will be produced. (A recent example is the development of the fast breeder reactor, which uses fuel much more efficiently[2]) [1] Max Schulz. ""Nuclear Power Is the Future"". Wilson Quarterly.

S712ab9ff-A2abd9ec2	The United States should invest in nuclear power.	"Not only does my opponent fail to cite a single source, but also, as it turns out, most his claims are false. For example, even if France has a debt of a few million dollars from its nuclear program(an unsubstantiated claim), their export of electricity from nuclear power plants makes them 3 billion Euros a year.[1] He claims the US invested in nuclear power, but that it ""just didn't work out""- I wonder, then, how he explains that the US is the largest producer of nuclear power in the world?[2] Sounds like it's working pretty well to me! My opponent also mentioned three mile island, citing it as an example of the disasters to come if we invest in nuclear energy. However, as he should know, not a single person died as the result of the three mile island meltdown. [3] If anything, this shows, not how dangerous nuclear power is, but how good we are at containing it and making it safe. Three Mile Island has been the ONLY serious accident involving any nuclear power plant in the US. We have been running nuclear power plants commercially in this country since 1957. Nuclear Energy may not yet be ""too cheap to meter"", but it is exceedingly efficient. So much so that a single pound of uranium packs the energy equivalent of a million gallons of gasoline. A MILLION GALLONS. [4] And at the moment we only have fission reactions. Scientists are working hard to construct reactors which will carry out controlled fusion reactions. These produce much more energy than fission, and can use hydrogen (deuterium) and lithium for fuel, in addition to producing no radioactive waste at all. If we are able to master this process, we could have enough energy to power the earth are current energy consumption levels for 150 BILLION YEARS. That is ten times longer than the age of the universe itself. [5] It really doesn't get more sustainable than that. It saddens me that people like my opponent would oppose nuclear power on unsound logic and misguided fears. The energy nuclear fusion would make available to us is beyond the wildest dreams of anyone now living. The current dangers are extremely well controlled and, in the future, may well be eliminated.

Sf59a1cd-Aa94eddbd	Beginner's Tournament, Nuclear Power Plants	Before I make my case, lets begin by a few rebuttal: 1. Our opponent has stated that nuclear power is not cost-effective.But according to UK Electricity Generation Summary, we need to pay for 96.5 pounds for 1 megawatts of energy generated by coal, while 93.4 pounds for 1 megawatt of energy produced by uranium(i.e. nuclear energy)[1]. Thus, we can see that nuclear power plant is the cheapest one for generating electricity. 2.Our opponent has exaggerated the health effects of using nuclear plants.Although these are accidents, but according to Clean Air Task Force, nearly 12,000 deaths in the USA only are accounted to coal-fired power stations.[2] Can our dear opponent tell us that these 12,000 peoples' lives don't matter? Nuclear power is safe, stable and superior. I will tell you that nuclear power generation is a must in our advanced society in this round; stating that nuclear power plant is safer than most generation method and we cannot use alternatives to power our world in round 2, and then conclude our case in Round 3. Nuclear power is safe, stable and superior. Nuclear energy today is well-developed, and it is cleaner, more stable than the other electricity generation methods. Clean: Nuclear fuels are technically infinite and it don't produce harmful gases into the atmosphere we live in.[3]It is also producing the least harmful by-products to us[4]. Comparing to fossil fuels, which gives out lots of harmful gases and greenhouse gases, is a better one to choose. In normal operation, nuclear power plants don't ever injure a person, but in fossil fuel plants, it is annually killing 12,000 persons only in USA[1]. Can our opponent neglect the harmful effects that fossil fuels have brought to us? Stable: Nuclear fuel is currently supplying countries with nuclear plants continuous power. This is different with other renewable energy, as renewable energy only produce energy when the specific weather demands for it is accomplished, for example, you cannot produce solar power when it is raining. Can our opponent imagine that in a hospital, patients are dying just because it's raining and solar power plants cannot produce energy? Thus, we need nuclear power to keep up with our energy demands; nuclear power is currently holding 10.8% of the power grid,[5] and is projected to expand. Why is it so? Because countries need it! Dear opponent, if you cannot give me concrete examples of how nuclear energy can be replaced, then this motion must stand. Nuclear power is safe, stable and superior.This motion must stand, thank you!

[T]technical fixes cannot provide a lasting resolution. History shows that energy demand keeps growing even in the most energy-saturated affluent societies: encouraging worldwide diffusion of this trend (new China, and then India, aspiring to replicate the US) and trying to fill the supply through scientific and engineering ingenuity is not a formula compatible with maintaining a viable biosphere. Obviously, poor countries need more energy; but the rich ones should, sooner, rather than later, think about engineering rational reductions in energy use. All economies are just subsystems of the biosphere and the first law of ecology is that no trees grow to heaven. If we are not going to engineer thoughtful, gradual reductions, we run a considerable risk that the biosphere may do the scaling-down for us in a much less desirable (if not catastrophic) manner."""

Safa455cc-A33458cd2	Nuclear power is a reasonable approach to generating electricity	"Defense of my arguments: 1) Environmental. Nuclear waste is not as dangerous as fossil fuel waste. There are different types of radioactive wastes, most forms are low level waste produce that decay in a matter of hours or days.[1] The waste that can't be recycled is sealed in special containers that are sent deep underground in loads when enough waste has been gathered. The waste gradually decays out of reach of any part of the ecosystem. But note: It decays. The same cannot be said of fossil fuel waste that will never decay. It will always remain deadly. Think of nuclear waste like a favour to nature. We dig it out of the ecosystem where it was doing harm to nature, then we turn it into a lesser isotope that is sealed away to become stable and safe. If you have any fears, let the Australian government dispel them here: http://www.ret.gov.au... 2) Sustainability. Uranium is not sustainable. If we keep digging it up and using it inefficiently and wasting it, it may last us only 60 years. But with the best of 21st Century technology, we can now extend that to 30,000 years. The same cannot be said of fossil fuels. We will burn them out much faster and then finally concede that we need a more reasonable approach to the creation of electricity. 3) Economy. ""because of the amount of money that needs to be spent on the maintenance of the safety gear that must go along with the plant, it doesn't cost as much as coal or oil or gas.""~quote from a very misguided opponent. The costs associated with Nuclear power plants can be broken down into four areas where money is needed to be spent in large amounts:[2] >The construction cost of building the plant. >The operating cost of running the plant and generating energy. >The cost of waste disposal from the plant. >The cost of decommissioning the plant. Construction costs are always the biggest cost for a nuclear power plant. It costs more to build it than to maintain its safety features however much my opponent may disagree. He mainly overlooks the fact that construction costs are about to drop dramatically during the USA development of its next phase of Nuclear plants[2]. The USA have been studying the French, and have used their knowledge and experience to make a new design of reactors. This means that nuclear plants will be cheaper to build than Coal plants and will be able to build much faster. As for the running of Nuclear plants, 0.2 cents per KW-Hr[2]. That's lower than coal plants,[3] which are not much different to run. But the mining and transport costs have not been considered. So nuclear is cheaper to build, and cheaper to run, which is the main costs associated with the running of it. Mantianance is just cleaners and safety checks that don't even rank as a noticeable cost. 4) Efficiency. Has not been refuted. Extend argument. 5) Safety. Has not been refuted. Extend argument. 6) Technological advancement. Has not been refuted. Extend argument. Rebuttals: 1) Nuclear is not safe Nuclear power has been given a very bad light by the media. There were a couple dozen deaths at Chernobyl, a nuclear power accident that will never happen again, and so far there have been no fatalities at fukishima, where people there have got a decent understanding of safety. My opponent is rather hypocritical here. He acknowledges that the pollution of fossil burning kills 850,000 people every year,[4] but gets really angry when one of the first prototype reactors goes bang due to some really bad handling that was easily avoided but is now managed. Out of all the accidents that have happened at coal plants, I think its the media to thank that we never hear of them and that nuclear plants have been given so much scrutiny. They are safe due to all this attention we give them, now we need to give equal scrutiny to fossil fuel plants. 2) Poses a risk of nuclear war Nonsense. He says that the temptation of having fissile material will be too much for most countries. What he might as well say is: These countries will take the Uranium they have and build giant underground bunkers dedicated to the creation of nuclear missiles hidden from sight. Now, to make a nuclear missile, you need permission from the countries that already have nukes. As it stands, all of them are saying NO. Should your country choose to disregard that, that will not end in a nuclear war, but it will make a lot of powerful people angry. Which causes dissension and non-nuclear war. But keep in mind this isn't because of nuclear power plants, as the Uranium used in plants are not high enough quality for nuke use and the enrichment centres are illegal to be built and cannot be done so without provoking retaliation. So it isn't the power plants, its the want for weapons of mass-destruction. Uranium used in power stations is useless as weaponry. 3) Nuclear waste I feel that I have given this point enough attention for one day, refer up to my defense of argument #1 for info. My opponent proposes the use of wind turbines or solar power as an alternative to nuclear. They wont work. They don't produce enough electricity, its not always windy or sunny, you cant run a country on sunlight and wind. The solar panels required would cover an expanse that would make the world look like an ant. There aren't enough places where you can put wind turbines, etc, etc... There are just so many reasons why the government has not already turned to this type of primitive energy. Nuclear is the only reasonable approach to generating electricity in this day and age.

Sae50ee6c-Ab0b5e341	The US Should Subsidize Nuclear Power	R1-Urgency I agree with Con that global warming is an urgent matter. However, it is impossible to know how long it will take to reach this tipping point. For example, the UN predicted in 2014 that over the next 15 years we must cut emissions dramatically. However, they also said back in 1982 that we’d reach the tipping point by the turn of the century; despite this, emissions haven’t went down, but we still haven’t reached the tipping point. (1) Some scientists even have the prediction as early as 2020. (2) So it’s obviously impossible to predict the tipping point, and it could be much longer than anyone expects. Let’s look at the 2020 prediction. Pro shows how WWS could only take 2-5 years to setup. I agree with that (remember I’m not arguing that only nuclear power should be subsidized). However, his numbers for the 11-19 years for a NP plant are far off. There are 5 power plants currently under construction in the US (although one of them saw its construction shut down decades ago and just recently is being started up again, so I’ll omit that one in the analysis.) Southern Nuclear’s Vogtle plant is getting a 3rd and 4th unit. They first applied for permits in 2006. Construction then began in 2013 for both of them and Vogtle 3 is expected to be done by 2016 and Vogtle 4 by 2017. (3) SCE&G’s VC summer plant is getting a 2nd and 3rd unit as well. They applied for a permit in 2008, construction began in 2013 and are said to be done by 2017 and 2018 respectively. (4) So that’s 9-11 years including the permit. Construction itself only takes 3-5 years. Permits are necessary, however, the US government could step in and try to speed up the permit process or even construction. Either way, if needed the government could speed it up. They could also be sped up by converting carbon plants to nuclear plants. Taking a quick look at the designs: (5, 6) In fact, the opposite has happened before. A nuclear plant which almost completely done production ended up being converted to a coal plant. (7) Obviously they were internally similar enough, so this could be another way to save time, while also reducing carbon emissions directly. Overall, Con admits that it wouldn’t even be until 2030 when the country can be fully powered by WWS, so even if nuclear reactors don’t start popping up in the 2020s it could greatly speed up the process of phasing out of coal, oil, and natural gas. If a coal plant is shutdown to be replaced by a nuclear one there will be a net reduction in emissions, so it would only be a net positive, so it makes the whole contention useless. R2-Costs Con says that a solar plant costs about 5 cents per kWh. However, I’m going to quote Con’s own source here, “That 5.79 cents per kilowatt-hour is a low number...seemingly half of what has typically been paid for projects of this nature.” (7) So in that case a solar power cost about the same as nuclear power. Not to mention, it’s in New Mexico which is one of the sunniest areas in the country. As I’ve already shown last round the French pay little for electricity because of their nuclear power plants. Also, a nuclear power plant would produce more power. A 1GW nuclear plant could produce 7889GW of electricity per year. However, a 3.6GW solar plant would be needed to produce the same amount of power, because nuclear is much more efficient (sun’s not always shining). (8) In fact, Tracey Durning of the Energy Options Network said ““In 2014, one of the cheapest utility scale solar plants in the US had an expected installed price of $2,000 per kilowatt. But since US solar plants operate at only about 25 per cent capacity factor, the cost per capacity-adjusted kilowatt is $8,000.” (8) However, the average initial capital cost of plants setup in the US is $6500 per kW. (8) When you consider nuclear power is much more efficient, it really is the cheapest option. In fact, the amount of power nuclear plants generate is why as I mentioned last round France makes billions of Euros exporting electricity. Also, the cost for enriching uranium could be avoided with CANDU style reactors (which doesn’t use enriched uranium), which are also more efficient and safe. (11, 12) R3-Terrorism The first part of Con’s argument has nothing to do with terrorism. He’s merely talking about countries wanting to develop nuclear weapons with them. Of course, this has nothing to do with the US as they already have a huge military, including a large nuclear weapon arsenal. However, he does talk about the risk of a plane being flown into a nuclear plant (like during 9/11). The chances of that happening are extremely low. First of all, that’s never happened. Also, ever since 9/11 the US has increased airport security and has never had a plane hijacking since. R4-Reliability Even if a NP plant had to be shutdown due to environmental concerns, it still would generate more electricity for a long time than WWS, as certain areas may not get enough exposure to sunlight or wind. Plus, global warming affects hydropower in the same way it does nuclear. (9) As for storage of hazardous materials be released, we can learn from the mistakes in Japan. We can store them in better ways. We can’t stop doing something all together, because one thing was not done well enough in the past. R5-Meltdowns The chances of another major meltdown are happening is low. Not counting Fukushima it has been decades since one has happened. People are obviously being safer and increasing precautions. Also, many countries which use a lot of nuclear power (e.g. France) have never had a major nuclear meltdown. So why did Fukushima happen? The regulators were reluctant to adapt global safety standards. (10) Nuclear meltdowns are in reality very rare and assuming the US sets up safe reactors the chances of a reactor causing a total meltdown is low. Also if Japan had used the safer CANDU reactors it may have been avoided less severe. (13) C1-Environment As mentioned CANDU reactors don’t need to be enriched. However, even light water reactors are good for the environment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the lifecycle emissions for many energy sources. Using the median values, nuclear power generated 12 gCO2eq/kWh (grams of equivalent carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour), which was tied with offshore wind and less than solar (which depending on the type varied from 27-48 gCO2eq/kWh & hydropower which was at 24 gCO2eq/kWh). (14) Also, in fact, they found that nuclear power generated less infrastructure & supply chain emissions than all of the WWS sources except wind. (14) C2-Large Source I indirectly addressed this above. C3-Cost The reason the free market doesn’t adapt it is because it’s expensive to start compared to coal and other sources. I didn’t deny this, but said once generated it is cheap and potentially a profit maker. C4-Thorium & Fusion Con’s main argument is that it could take a long time to develop and that WWS sources should get the money right now due to the urgency. However, putting some money in fusion & thorium could be useful. We may be a lot closer than previously thought as I already said last round a fusion reactor is being made in France (produced by the US, EU, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia) and thorium reactors (produced by China & Canada) are currently being produced.

S2f07394f-A686391e2	America should expand nuclear energy production.	"As Con, I will be arguing that the United States should not seek to build more nuclear power plants. Undeniably nuclear power could generate an enormous amount of electricity while releasing virtually no greenhouse gases; given numerous reasons including the potential safety risk, and the challenge of disposing of nuclear waste, however, it is unwise to build more nuclear power plants. Exorbitant Cost Construction & Operational Cost While no one knows exactly how much a new nuclear reactor will cost, the estimation for new construction continue to rise. A collection of new studies suggest that the actual cost of building a new nuclear reactor would be between $3,600 and $4,000 per installed KW. According to Synapse Energy Economic Inc., companies that are planning new nuclear units were expected to pay $5,500/kW to 8,100/kW or between $6 billion and $9 billion for each 1,100 MW plant (2008 figure).[2] In October 2007, Florida Power & Light (FPL) announced a range of overnight costs for its two proposed nuclear power plants (total of 2200MV) as being between $3,108/kW and 4,4540/Kw. FPL also estimated the total cost of the project (including escalation and financing costs) as being between $5,492/kW and $8,081/kW. These estimated costs translated into a projected total cost of $12.1 billion to $17.8 billion, for just two 1100 MW plants.[2] As if the things were not bad enough, one company, MidAmercian Energy Holding, announced at the end of 2007 that it had cancelled a proposed nuclear power plant because no longer made made economic sense for its ratepayers.[2] Comparing to other energy source, nuclear-powered energy costs 14 percent more than gas to produce a unit of electricity and it costs almost 30 percent more than coal.[1] The increased cost of nuclear energy includes a taxpayers subsidy of up to 80 percent of nuclear power""s operating costs.[2] Subsidizing costly nuclear power plants directs that money to large, centralized facilities, built by a few large companies that will take the profits out of the communities they build in. To make the things worse, private sectors are unwilling to finance the new plant due to its high financial risk, which necessarily leaves the government subsidy as the only option.[3] Storage Cost The above cost estimation does not take expense of storing nuclear waste in to consideration. In August 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy offered an updated estimate of the cost of building and operating Yucca Mountain, the planned centralized repository being erected in Nevada. The DOE noted that the expected cost for Yucca Mountain was $96.2 billion in 2008/2009, and this figure only covers the costs of building the facility and transporting waste until 2133.[4] Potential Risk & Safety Issue Another great concern that frequents Nuclear energy is safety issue. Undeniably, in the wake of 9/11, the safety of nuclear plants have greatly improved. The safety problems, however, persist. A disaster like the Chernobyl, Three Island, and Japan Fukushima Diichi plant accidents can happen anytime anyplace. In fact, as super-storm Sandy punched the East Coast hard in the stomach and claimed many innocent lives, three nuclear power plants were forced to shut down and an alert was issued for the Oyster Creek Plant for potential safety issue.[5] Prior to Japan Fukushima accidents, industries including national government tend to believe that the current design is sufficient to sustain every situation that mankind can possibly image. It seems that none of earthquakes, hurricanes, direct strikes by jets/airplanes, and terrorists could breach the concrete wall surrounding the nuclear reactor.[6] Shortly after the accident on March 11, 2011, however, those perceptions of safety began rapidly changing. Nuclear facility remains vulnerable. A well-designed, highly redundant system can still fail catastrophically. Do anyone really want to see what will happen to them if a terrorist attacks a nuclear power plant or experience a nuclear meltdown if tropic storm like Sandy breach the safety design of a nuclear facility? Waste Management The primary waste product of nuclear power, spent fuel rods, remains highly toxic for literally thousands of years. On average, a nuclear power plant annually generates 20 metric tons of high-level radioactive waste.[7] So far, there are 104 operational nuclear power plant in the United States, and the combined total climbs to approximately 2,080 metric tons a year.[8] Since all of this waste emits radiation and heat, it will eventually corrode any container that holds it. Although most experts agree that the best way to dispose of waste is deep underground, when the Department of Energy picked Yucca Mountain in southwestern Nevada for repository, however, the proposal immediately became a political non-starter. No matter how supportive the communities are with respect to nuclear energy, no one would want a box of highly toxic substance buried in his or her backyard. Today, the nuclear waste goes into ""spent fuel polls"" at nuclear power plants like the one at Indian Point, just 35 miles north of New York City. Consider that the U.S. Government recommended a 50-mile evacuation radius during the Fukushima disaster, a catastrophe would ensue with a mathematical certainty if anything happens to the nearby nuclear reactor.[5] Serious failing in storage technology has resulted in widespread opposition. Conclusion Americans do not need nuclear power. Energy demands can be and also should be met from other sources from clean coal energy to natural gas. It is undeniable that climate change is real and people should actively attempt develop new technology to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and reduce energy costs. The nuclear energy, however, is not the answer to this enduring question. It is not unreasonable to assert that Nuclear energy is relatively clear energy, but numbers suggest that the technology is not cost-effect and inherent risk associated with nuclear energy is too great to ignore. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Fukushima accident had taught us a great lesson: nuclear energy is not the solution. Thank you References [1]. http://reason.com...

See0f4916-A58b69d7b	The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives	"In this final debate, I will analyze the two competing sides in terms of the claims made in this debate, hopefully distilling why the judges should cast a Pro ballot. First, there is the issue of government regulation. I say that government regulation is sometimes beneficial, and that funding for IFR's is one of those times. My opponent says that government intervention in the free market is bad. He cites the housing bubble and its accompanying financial crisis as the example. The following evidence has been introduced: Pro: Richard Posner, the main proponent of the law and economics movement and the most cited legal scholar in America has provided analysis that the housing collapse was due to self-interested businesspeople, coupled with the de-regulation of the housing market, which caused a catastrophic economic collapse. Con: A Wikipedia page containing a timeline of events that various people feel were involved in creating the economic crisis, some of them government-related, others not. Second, my opponent cites Steven Chu and makes a new argument about IFR's not being needed. However, the link he provides states ""[We're] looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste… These are fast neutron reactors."" Thus, IFR's are considered a potential by the federal government. Third, there is the issue of spending and trade-offs. I say that we can spend money on IFR's and other programs. He says that I have to show that IFR's are the best possible use of our money. The following evidence has been introduced: Pro: IFR's only cost $200-$300 million to complete. IFR's will create jobs and generate tax revenue for the government. IFR's create cheaper energy, meaning the government can save money by cutting other subsidies. Education funding is being increased to $71.5 billion next year, and won't be cut. 80% of education spending is done at the state and local level. Even if education is important, it will be worthless if we are dead from a nuclear volcano. IFR's will generate thousands of jobs and save the economy from the recession. Con: Education and defense spending is important, and there's no reason why IFR's are more important. Next, my opponent says we shouldn't use IFR's to generate revenue. I'm not saying that's the purpose – it just answers your claim that it's too expensive. It will pay for itself, through greater tax revenue. Next, my opponent says that the polls I cited do not make the case for prioritizing IFR's over health care or defense. The following evidence has been introduced: Pro: 55% of Americans want lower or status quo defense spending. 40% of Americans think the health care bill was a bad idea. 70% of Americans want new nuclear traditional nuclear plants. 79% of Americans want IFR-style nuclear plants. Con: The surveys don't show a clear priority of IFR nuclear plants over defense and health care spending. This is ridiculous. 79% > 55% or 40%. If the question is: what do people want more: more defense spending or more spending on nuclear plants, simple math dictates the answer is nuclear plants. Next, my opponent says I should go over ECON 101 and find the reasons why government interference in the market is bad. THIS IS A DEBATE! THAT'S HIS JOB! If you want to claim that government interference is bad, give me some evidence or at least a logical argument. I need something more than a Wikipedia page and instructions to look up your arguments myself. Next, my opponent says that we can't blame the free market for environmental destruction, and that every development has pros and cons, including developments by the government and free markets. BUT HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY REFUTE MY CLAIMS THAT FREE MARKET CAPITALISM IS CAUSING ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION. He says it's narrow minded, and that private investment has invested resources to help the environment. But I'm still waiting for a refutation of Dr. Richard Robbins four specific arguments why capitalism is destroying the environment. Until he does that, this is an independent reason to ignore his free market claims. His next argument is that all development creates environmental problems, and that China's problem is internal corruption. The following evidence has been introduced: Pro: Wang Yi, an expert in Chinese development and a published author, has demonstrated that the transition to a market economy has created a huge environmental crisis in China, and that government regulation is needed to curb these problems. Con: Claims that China's problems are corruption and that all economic development harms the environment (no evidence presented) My argument is simple: private corporations do not have an incentive to spend money to fix the environmental damage they create unless the government forces them to. If they did, they would be bad capitalists. IFR's are an example of how the government can encourage responsible waste treatment. Next, my opponent says I haven't provided claims why we should prioritize energy over other policies. Even though I've made all kinds of arguments about no trade-offs, revenue and job creation, and pre-existing spending, I'll make the conclusion very simple, in two points: IFR's are not going to be developed by the private market. PERIOD (see below). IF WE DON'T DEVELOP IFR'S, WE WILL ALL DIE IN A HORRIBLE NUCLEAR VOLCANO. My opponent's last argument is that the free market will solve all our problems. My analysis has been simple: If I am a businessperson, I care about me (""invisible hand""). I will live no longer than 100 more years. Any nuclear volcano will happen after I die. My customers will live no longer than 100 more years. Any nuclear volcano will happen after they die. Thus, they do not demand an alternative to nuclear volcanoes. I will thus not supply an alternative to nuclear volcanoes (IFR's). Because the market and consumers are short-sighted, they do not appear to care about terrible things which will happen in the distant future. Because of this, there is no market for IFR's, and no IFR will be created without government assistance. It is not due to government interference – it is due to the fundamental failures of capitalism. My opponent asked for a simple explanation why energy should be a priority over other important social needs. The importance of IFR's can be summed up by Dr. David Camarow: ""When you are talking about these kind of risks, risks that can endanger entire segments of our population, let alone the entire earth, then the risk analysis must go into higher gear. It is not enough to merely calculate the risks as ‘extremely low' – because there is no ‘low enough' when the consequences are so cataclysmic. We accept certain risks, which are relatively high – 50,000 traffic deaths per year, for example. But, as terrible as those deaths and injuries are, they do not imperil our culture, our nation, or the survival of the human race… As a people, as caretakers for future people, we cannot create unnecessary catastrophic risks like biosphericide, the agonizing death of billions."" Regardless of any of the arguments, we have a choice: a Pro vote to get IFR's and prevent Dr. Camarow's nightmare scenario, or a Con vote and risk the potential failures of the market. I feel the answer is clear, and I ask for a Pro vote. Thank you!"	PRO	326

S4c598a77-A9b53fedc	Nuclear power is a good idea	"Thank you for your very thoughtful response! 1. While you are correct that Chernobyl was a steam explosion, the reason that it was so catastrophic was because of all the nuclear material, not directly because of the explosion itself, so that is a moot point. What you have implied in this argument is that you have such a strong trust in the personnel and technology of nuclear reactors that you feel that accidents absolutely cannot happen. Ah, how I would love to live in your Utopian world. Even if the accidents that could happen only have a very slight chance of happening, and even if they aren't as catastrophic as Chernobyl, accidents still happen. Think about this: Would you have liked to have been in Hiroshima right after the US bombed them during WWII? There would be plenty of radiation, and you would very likely contract Cancer. Now imagine a nuclear power incident 1/400 the size of the Chernobyl incident. The amount of radioactive fallout in that would be the same amount of radioactive fallout in the Hiroshima bombing [1]. So it's not as if a much smaller explosion wouldn't be catastrophic. Even if there is only a tiny chance that a catastrophe could happen, that's still a chance, and there are so many other ways that wouldn't cause a catastrophe (I'd like to see a wind turbine blow up). 2. Nuclear waste doesn't just go away. Yes, it will decay by itself to a safe level eventually, but for high level nuclear waste, that could take many millennia, many radioactive isotopes decaying into other radioactive isotopes. Granted, most nuclear waste is low-level, but not all of it is. For example, Nuclear power plants usually produce U-234 [2], which has a half life of about 236,000 years [3], so it's not particularly radioactive, but it's radioactive enough that you wouldn't want to be spending long periods of time with a large quantity of it. Also, it produces Pu-238 [2], which has a half-life of about 87.7 years, in which it turns into our good friend U-234 [4], and it is so radioactive that it actually glows from its own heat that it produces. And a half life of 87.7 years doesn't mean that it will be gone in 87.7 years, it means that half of it will be gone in 87.7 years. Then half of what's left will be gone in another 87.7 years. It keeps going like that until there are only a few atoms left. Unfortunately, we'd be continuing to produce it at a faster rate than it was decaying, so we'd have it for quite a while. ""However, it is possible to upkeep the containers (since we upkeep all our roads and buildings and everything else from corrosion), and we can even design the containers to be extremely immune to corrosion...so that the life span goes from decades to centuries to possible millennia."" Well, assuming we don't put any more waste in a facility, it takes 87.7 years for half of the Pu-238 to go away. It takes 236,000 years for half of the U-234 to go away. Centuries certainly won't cut it. Millennia won't really either, especially if we keep producing more waste. ""Nuclear power plants also don't produce that much waste, about 20 tons a year per plant...That's the same amount of waste (by weight, not volume) as about 25 people, per year."" But the waste produced by humans isn't radioactive. And I'm all about ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,"" but that's completely different from Nuclear waste. And I'm not going to directly quote you on your discussion of safer nuclear plants, but as I said, unless you can guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong, it's not safe enough. ""While just over the vent stack, readings up to 1,200 millirems were recorded (indicating that radioactive material was making it out into the environment. The government maintained a registry for 18 years of the 30,000 people that lived in the vicinity and found that they did not experience ANY health fallout (no increased rate of cancer, no increased rate of birth defects, no increased rate of brain issues)."" Still, radioactive matter does cause health issues. Perhaps they didn't find any in this particular instance, but it does happen. But even with that, the issue of waste kind of trumps that in the first place. Because that produces a lot of radiation and a lot of problems. ""Research has shown that nuclear workers will, on average, be subjected to about 1,000 millirem per year (compared to the average individual who gets about 360 per year), and that will, on average, lessen the workers life by about 50 days"" That's an average. If you don't get cancer, then your lifespan isn't affected. But it raises your chances of cancer by that much. ""It is also only fair to compare this energy source to other ones, such as coal or oil. Those industries can only wish for the environmental and safety history of US nuclear power plants."" I agree. But don't you think you're being selective there? You ignored wind power. And non-invasive hydropower. And solar power. That's just naming a few. Our nation is lucky enough to have a wonderful geography for harvesting these kinds of power. We have many rivers and an extensive coastline that we can put non-invasive hydroelectric turbines. We have Huge areas where there could be wind turbines. The city of Portland has pioneered in technologies such as wind farms on top of tall buildings. While that doesn't provide all the energy for the building, they hope to be able to make it more efficient on other buildings. Also, some cities require solar panels on all buildings. One thing I really strongly remember about Jerusalem is that every single building, be it a house, a store, a hotel, or anything, had solar panels on the roof. We could do that. Yes, coal and oil are dirty and yucky. That is why we have all these alternatives.

I have already shown that with PBRs and Fusion Reactors, that meltdowns are physically impossible.

It physically can be diluted back to what nature had it as and put back in nature, zero sum. B) The sunshine canyon landfill can hold 90 million tons of waste[1]. And a new land fill outside of LA will be taking 20,000 tons a day for the next hundred years (700 million tons of waste)[2]. First thing to point out is that I'm not advocating these particular locations, only pointing out that we have the space. Since the average nuclear site produces 20 tons of waste a year, 10,000 nuclear reactors (which is over 20 times our current world amount of 436[3]) would produce 200,000 tons a year, and would take 3,500 years to fill that one single location (and we could have more then one, easily). C) Looking at the potential a 700 million ton land fill. We can also see that if the land fill was full of 700 million tons of nuclear waste, breaking down with a 1/2 life of 324,000 years, means that 350 million tons would break down after 324,000 years, or at a rate of 750 tons per year (1 - (.5)^(1/324000)), or enough for almost 36 nuclear reactors running full time with the amount of waste they produce actually breaking down, so no net volume is added. And remember that is for a single land fill site (we can have more then one and also remember that I am not suggesting that particular site but only the concept that it is physically possible). Here I have presented 3 options as to why the nuclear waste is not a major problem, without going into futuristic methods (like ejecting it into space, which may become more feasible in upcoming decades). ""...unless you can guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong, it's not safe enough."" So I take it you will never drive a car (can't guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong), or have a significant other (can't guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong), breath anything other then 100% filtered air (which doesn't exist, even in computer processing plants), or ever step out side (can't guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong). The argument that one must guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong is not realistic for anything, nuclear included. The only thing that needs to be done is that they are safe enough that the benefit out weighs the risk. For people that live near nuclear power plants, they experience, on average 0.1 millirem per year more then other people [#12 from last round], where as a full set of dentist xrays gives about 40 millirems. There are also a lot of items in your homes that use radiation to work, like a smoke detector. [4] ""Still, radioactive matter does cause health issues. Perhaps they didn't find any in this particular instance, but it does happen."" This was the worst nuclear incident in American history. If the worst incident in American history had no ill effects and we've made it so it is physically impossible for it to happen again, that indicates that they are, in fact, safe enough. Other sources are great, however they do lack one fundamental thing. Consistency. While I support and encourage the use of solar and wind, they, at best, can provide secondary energy sources. Because they are not able to run 24/7 they cannot provide energy 24/7 and cannot be relied on as the primary source. Nuclear can. [1] http://www.sunshinecanyonlandfill.com...

Sdd09931a-Ab3184f73	Resolved: The United States should Significantly Increase its Use of Nuclear Energy	"I forfeited round 3 in an effort to even out my opponent's forfeiture of Round 3. Now he has forfeited Round 5. Though my opponent provided some ""cons"" to the ""pros"" of the use of nuclear energy, he has not provided any concrete reasons as to why the United States should not significantly increase it's use of nuclear energy. In fact, his contentions- a significant increase would only raise use by 20% max by 2050; demand for energy will increase; etc. are in favor of a significant increase of the use of nuclear energy when we take into consideration his main con- the environment. Nuclear energy is not the safest method for producing energy according to my opponent. Indeed uranium is much more hazardous than coal, but how many people have died in uranium mines compared to those who have died in coal mines? (http://www.world-nuclear.org...) Thousands of Navajo Indians have died mining uranium. This must be acknowledged. But looking at the above information- 5,000 annual deaths in China due to coal mining, thousands dead throughout history in the US, let alone the other accidents associated with the production of energy, nuclear is the safest because the material is the most dangerous forcing companies to take strenuous precautions. The effects of nuclear energy on the environment have been weighed. It is one of the safest and most efficient means of producing energy. It is cheaper energy than coal, it employs technology that is further developed than a massive increase in solar, wind, and hydro energy, and it is amongst the lowest in carbon emissions. Yes- we need to develop safer ways to store and recycle spent rods. Yes, we need to develop safer ways to transport and mine uranium. Yes, we need to find safer ways to cool reactors. The need for development of technology BEFORE significantly increasing the use of nuclear energy does not mean we should not do it. A significant increase would be in harmony with my opponent's contention that it is only possible to raise production by 20% of the total. Current use is at 17% in the US, and a raise in 20% by 2050 is a more than 100% increase- especially if demand rises (to maintain current market share levels). He claims an increase of solar and wind is possible to raise it to 39% by 2050. Great! Those are also essential pieces of the energy pie! In conclusion, in order for the US to accomplish energy independence, security, lower energy costs, and improve greenhouse emissions- the United States should significantly increase its use of nuclear energy. Thank you."	PRO	332

Sefd746e-A1d7a819d	Nuclear Power VS. Solar Power	Rebuttals: I will try to present rebuttals regarding the Pro`s arguments for Round 2. 1. Cost : Pro points out that a Nuclear Power Plant cost less than half a comparable solar power plant per megwatt. However, a new technology which contributes to producing a solar power with less cost is being seriously studied and will be introduced into it in the future. At this time one of the benefits of a nuclear power plant over solar power will be faded away. In fact many companies have been challenging for developing a new technology for solar power for many years. 2. Capacity and Safety : It is true that a nuclear plant can simply run at full load all night or during cloudy/ rainy days. However, in case of Japan, people must take a natural disaster into consideration. For example, it is predicted that a great earthquake might happen in Japan. Therefore, in that country a nuclear power is not a safety and dependable energy source. If the natural disaster or technical accident at nuclear power plant might take place, the soils around the plant would be contaminated with nuclear waste for many years. The important thing is that the the accident of a nuclear power plant brings about the devastation of the local economy and the life of people as we have experienced in the Fukushima reactors. The continuation of my argument will be made for Round 4.	CON	334
S3af9364a-A49b63b1	Nuclear Power is the most viable substitute from fossil fuels	"Thank you for this interesting and invigorating debate. First of all I would like to thank you for posting the link to the chart. I was pretty confused but I am no longer confused, but this chart is irrelevant to my arguments as they are about diseases and afflictions that are caused by radiation and toxicity of the enrichment process to create energy. This matters very little this debate however because the numbers are completely unknown, so I will drop this argument. My opponent then continues to say ""My opponent has yet to provide the real cost of digging a hole a couple miles deep and releasing many toxic materials as I have previously mentioned."" You mean like how you gave the real cost to creating a powerplant? We do not need to give exact numbers, reasonable comparisons can be made in exchange. Judges please base this off of logic and reasoning AS WELL AS persuasive evidence. My comparison is, of course, oil. Companies who obtain oil must dig holes to extract it. But in the world of my opponent, they won't get past digging the hole because of how expensive it is? That makes no sense to me. Every bit of energy we obtained must be prepared. For example, coal needs to be mined in a facility, oil needs to be drilled, nuclear energy needs to be fissioned in proper conditions, geothermal energy needs to be drilled. How is geothermal energy hole drilling any more expensive than oil hole drilling? Realistically, it is not. My opponent goes on to say ""My opponent is suggesting that we just transport thousands of gallons of water to our desired 2 to 3 mile hole and allow it to turn into steam."" Yes exactly, just like how nuclear energy requires the transportation of 60,000 tons uranium (number from your evidence cited for the ""chart"") each year. How does this make either sources of energy any less viable? Just because we aren't getting spoon fed alternative energy sources means we cannot work hard to obtain it? That is utter nonsense. My opponent also says ""As to my opponents second rebuttal, I am quite offended. I ask him to do his research first before making any rash statements."" No, you asked me a question where you and I both already knew the answer. Of course geothermal energy is not used 40% or more in other countries. It is a new science, we are still learning about how to make it better and more productive. I made a few comparisons to what you attempted to do with Lady Gaga, which you happened to slither right by. Judges take note of this because later on he makes the claim of hitting all of my arguments ""head on"" because that little line is all he said about it. He did not defend WHY energies should be judged on that scale, only that they should with no warrant for his claim, and when I call him out on his lack of warrants, he gets ""offended."" He then continues his statement by saying ""There is A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CIVILIAN NUCLEAR PLANT AND A NUCLEAR BOMB."" This is a great example of him not hitting MY arguments head on. My argument is not the nuclear plants are similar to nuclear bombs. It is THE PROCESS of taking energy from uranium is EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the process that creates weapons grade plutonium. Other countries are given the right to plans of nuclear powerplants, but they are under constant watch by US forces exactly for the reason that the two processes are so similar. But lets go into a scenario. Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen decide to go to war with the United States. Uh oh, we already taught them how to make nuclear weapons, do you think that since there would be a war between us that they would respect our rights enough to not make nuclear weapons? Absolutely not. The risk of nuclear proliferation is greater than anything you can imagine. Communist Soviet Union actually wanted to maintain power and did not drop bombs on the US because they knew we would do the same thing. But how would an extremist country like Iran handle that situation. Amadimajhad is already trigger happy to drop bombs on our allies even without nuclear weapons. If we completely replaced nuclear energy with geothermal energy, the risk of nuclear proliferation is completely absent. My opponent goes on to speculate with ""I believe there is a reason that countries do not use geothermal energy because it is neither cost effective nor can it produce energy en mass and enough to supply demand. Nuclear can."" Well, if I was going to speculate, I would say that the reason that we use nuclear instead of geothermal energy is for three reasons. 1) it is too new. not very many people realize its potential, proven by our debate. 2) nuclear energy produces weapons grade plutonium that our military can use. (therefore the GOV funds it.) 3) The oil and coal industries have made it almost impossible to provide an alternative energy source with pure money (buying off country leaders, buying off politicians, muscling out small companies, everything needing energy relies on gas or oil.) My opponent makes this funny statement next ""Towards the end of the article, one can see that many countries that have nuclear power plants are not currently holders of nuclear weapons. I wonder why that is??"" First of all, that is nuclear weapons that we know about. Secondly, only 7 countries are ALLOWED to carry nuclear weapons. If any country carries nuclear weapons that is not the US, France, Pakistan, Israel, Russia, India, or China, they would have to go through a process to be allowed to have them. Iran and Saudi Arabia do not tell us they have nuclear weapons because they know we will not allow it. And as to my statement that I made that confused my opponent, I agree it is confusing so let me clarify. What I meant was that if we used geothermal energy instead of nuclear energy, we could share this technology with the world without fearing WMDs, and if we did, our environment would become safer at a faster rate than with nuclear energy because our government will simply not allow most countries to build nuclear power plants. I am sorry for my grammatical mistake. To pull this whole debate together, I have proven that geothermal energy is just as viable and just as economical as nuclear energy, but can actually be shared with the world to benefit us as a whole and without supplying other countries with the means to make nuclear weapons. My opponent says he has hit my points head on, I still have yet to see him do that. Even if nuclear energy WAS cheaper, and I will never admit that it is, it is not worth that risk of nuclear proliferation which we are forced to fear right now because we do not have control of every country. The risks of having nuclear energy outweigh the benefits. Geothermal energy has the same benefits and little to no risks. In the world of the Pro, we live in a world with great alternative energy and the possibility for every country who uses nuclear power plants to make WMDs. In the world of the Con, the same exact thing, except it can never cause nuclear winter."	CON	335
Sf59a1cd-A700eb094	Beginner's Tournament, Nuclear Power Plants	Rules: No forfeits No kritiks BoP is shared Citations can be in comments R1 Statements R2 Rebuttals R3 Rebuttals and Summary Definition: A nuclear power plant is a facility that converts atomic energy into usable power. In a nuclear electric power plant, heat produced by a reactor is generally used to drive a turbine which in turn drives an electric generator. Resolution: Nuclear power plants are not cost effective, pose risk to the populations in the event of accident and from power plant waste products. Cost: There are 435 nuclear power plants in the world, with the average age of 25 years in operation [1]. 75% of the plants in Europe are half way through their operating lifespan. Of the 104 in the US one half are over 30 years old, the rest 20 years in operation [2]. In the US, there is a high cost affiliated in keeping these aging plants running. Many are being decommissioned as a result; before the end of their expected life span of 40 years. It takes several decades to decommission a nuclear power plant. In light of these financial considerations, along with the cost of new construction, even with new technologies, outcomes are predicted to be similar. The investment is not cost effective [4]. With the down trend in natural gas prices and declining costs of alternative energy, nuclear power is no longer competitive in pricing per megawatt-hour [3]. Citing only 3 of the more recent nuclear power plant accidents and their cost: • 2011 Fukushima Daiichi, 30 billion dollars in has been paid out in compensation to evacuees for loss wages; pain & suffering, and property contamination; 207 billion in decommission costs [5]. Full cost effect over long term has yet to be determined. • 1986 Chernobyl, Ukraine, 15 billion to shelter the plant, 2.2 billion for infrastructure to maintain [6], Economic Damages 500 billion [7]. • 1979 Three Mile Island plant, Pennsylvania, 973 million [8]. These are cost are affiliated directly by accidents and do not include individual cost of the aftermaths such as cancer rates or relocation expenses not covered by nuclear, property or home owner insurance. Dangers & Wastes: Since 1952 there have been 32 nuclear power plant accidents [9]. With the ageing of Nuclear power plants combined with weather pattern changes and a better understanding of seismic activity, nuclear power plants and their waste products pose a risk. The decommissioning of Nuclear power plants and what to do with the radioactive bi-products of active plants has been unresolved since the 1980’s in the US. Currently, the nuclear wastes are stored on plant sites [10]. Waste storage is in the form of pools or dry casks which are now, or will soon to be at full capacity [11]. From 1999 through 2014 a number of reports and filings have been conducted with regards to pool storage and dry casts not meeting NEPA and AEA standards with no resolution yet made. Essentially this is a ticking time bomb where spontaneous combustion or melt down in storage pools, as well as land contamination from dry cast storage is at a breaking point [12, 13].

Safa455cc-A32c2ba7	Nuclear power is a reasonable approach to generating electricity	Firstly rebuttal: Nuclear energy is not environmentally friendly at all in the sense that the waste produced from a nuclear plant is so much more dangerous that waste produced by Fossil fuel plants. The radioactive material stays radioactive for a very long time. And it is very dangerous to life, if people come into close contact with the waste, they can get cancer and other terrible diseases. Plus, radioactive waste can contaminate entire water systems under the ground where people put them. This will lead to the destruction of life forms that use the water. Smithereens also says that it is sustainable. But its just like coal. its non-renewable. Once you dig it out of the ground, its not going to replenish itself in a hurry. He says that nuclear power is economical. But because of the amount of money that needs to be spent on the maintainence of the safety gear that must go along with the plant, it doesnt cost as much as coal or oil or gas. Smithereens failed to take these costs into consideration Now, my arguments are: -Its not safe to people -It poses a risk of nuclear war -nuclear waste is a big problem Its not safe: chernobyl was a great example of a nuclear failure. And whose to say it wont happen again? The disaster at Chernobyl was caused by human error. And human error is something that 21st century technology cant fix. There will always be people making mistakes that kill other people. Risk of nuclear war: What do you expect will happen when you gather enough high-quality nuclear material into one spot. The country that has it will be too tempted to make weapons out of it and exert world domination over those that dont. Its a very real threat and cannot be simply ignored by Smithereens. Nuclear waste: There is no real safe place to put it. if you put it underground, it will contaminate the ground, if you try to launch it into space, it would cost too much money. So we have this dangerous waste with us and nothing at all to do with it. So it is completely inhumane to dump it all into nature and the ecosystem where it will kill things. There are plently of better things we can do, like not use nuclear at all. We can use solar or wind turbines as an alternative. Smithereens has been arguing under the false impression that nuclear is all there is. Well, it isnt. There are many things we can do, just dont use things which are so destructive.	CON	337
Sf1a21db5-Ab7363b1b	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"I would first like to make note that the PRO is not allowed to alter his plan in any way after his first argument, although he may expand on everything else, I will first go over inherency, solvency, then significance and harms, covering all stock issues excluding topicality. I would like to remind the judges that it is the PRO's responsibility to cover all stock issues, and if even one is conceded (excluding inherency, that's up to the judge)that the PRO wins the round, since we are doing a policy debate. INHERENCY I believe that the PRO does not give a viable inherent barrier, without an inherent barrier the PRO and the judges both are often left misinformed on why the case isn't already being done, the PRO should show what the problem is in his inherency, then solve for that problem. SOLVENCY The PRO's plan says nothing about negotiating a contract to state how the money they pass out must be used, unless the PRO can prove that the organization they plan to give money to has absolutely no other agendas except obtaining electricity from fusion they cannot be sure that the money they put out will be used in the proper way, in which case their plan will fail. The PRO's plan says nothing about making fusion derived electricity available if it is somehow possible to get it, therefore the best they can do with this plan is research, and cannot guarantee that widespread use will come after development. The PRO has yet to show evidence that deuterium can be harvested legally. To expand on this I make note of the countless examples of endangered species living in the waters of our planet, unless the PRO can prove that harvesting deuterium out of our water will have absolutely no environmental repercussions we cannot be sure that the international community will allow the harvest of deuterium. Possibly the most important question the judge must ask is ""Is this even possible?"" the PRO states that fusion energy has been researched for fifty years, to no avail, and has not proved that we are any closer now than we were fifty years ago, it could be centuries before we achieve fusion power. SIGNIFICANCE & HARMS http://finance.yahoo.com...- Water pollution is already the single largest cause of sickness and death worldwide It is obvious that water pollution is a serious issue, but yet the PRO would like to harvest a mineral from our water, risking killing off species and furthering water pollution. The PRO states that ""Since no fossil fuels are used, there will be no release of chemical COMBUSTION products because they will not be produced."" The PRO fails to mention that there could be by products not produced by combustion, but simply states that combustion won't cause by products, other things could cause by products worse than burning oil. I would like to make a press for evidence that 1- Harvesting deuterium from water will have no environmental effects 2- There will not be by products at all, rather than just from combustion, or if there are, evidence that they won't be worse than the status quo 3- The programs he wishes to give money to have no other agendas 4- A statistic on the chance of having fusion power in the near future I believe that all of these facts are neccessary for the PRO to prove his point."

S2f07394f-Abe6c75e9	America should expand nuclear energy production.	"Rebuttal ""My opponent never really attacks...still stands."" Unlike France, the United States had once experienced the nuclear disaster in the past (Three Mile Island incident). Unlike France, Americans have abundant natural reserves. Pro""s contention is strong only if the two countries are alike, but Pro has yet included the relevant evidence to prove it so. ""My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters...and no nuclear damage from Sandy is proof"" Pro""s argument inevitably conveyed a false impression that the Fukushima disasters should be solely attributed to the design flaw, and since the United States would build new reactors with no pre-mentioned flaw, it is plausible to assume that the Fukushima disasters would not be repeated in the U.S. Pro, however, ignored the alternative explanation of the Fukushima disasters: human incapability of defending natural disasters. Japanese government well realized the design flaw and there was huge redundancy to cover the safety issue. But even so, the Japanese government still failed to secure the reactor during the Tsunami. [1] The reactors that failed in Japan are Mark 1 boiling water reactors designed by General Electric in the 1960s. Th Achilles heel in a boiling water reactor has to do with its cooling system. The main coolant in the nuclear reactor is water which is circulated through the electric pumps system. If the electric pumps lose power, the water inside the nuclear reactor would continue boil off. If enough water boils off, the nuclear core would get melted. In the worst case, the molten fuel, along with highly toxic substance, get released into the surrounding environment. [1] Because of this known vulnerability, there is huge redundancy around the pumps and their supply of electricity. In summary, there are three layers of extra-protections: Power can come from the power grid if the main reactor is shutdown. If that fails, there are additional backup diesel generators. If that fails as well, there is a backup batter system. Even with all this redundancy, the electric pump system still failed. During the incoming natural disasters, the nuclear power plants were immediately shut down. After the primary source of electricity was gone, rectors switched to power grid mode. However, the power grid was also disconnected because of the perennial earthquake. The secondary source of electricity was therefore gone. Then when the tsunami hit, the unexpected water levels from the tsunami causes the diesel generators to fail. The third defense was gone as well. Then it left the last layer of redundancy - batteries. But batteries were sized to last for only a few hours, and when the last defense was breached, water in the nuclear reactor continued boiling off. Hydrogen gas was quickly generated and accumulated, and it eventually exploded inside the reactor building. [1] Fukushima incident is not an atypical case. The nuclear power plant that near the NY city is identical to one in Fukushima Dai-ichi. Therefore, both nuclear reactors are subjected to the same safety concerns. Citied by Exelon""s statement, if the water level rose over 7 feet, there is a potential for the core to overheat. The water levels eventually reached a peak of 7.4 feet, but fortunately did not persist before it was down to 5.8 feet. If Sandy were stronger, it is not unreasonable to assume that another disaster would ensue. Given the continuation of global warming and climate change, human may face more Sandy type storms in the near future. [2] Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster had sent a resounding message to all Americans: a well designed nuclear reactor can still fail catastrophically. A good advise is: Do not play the game unless you afford to lose. ""If several stations are commissioned at once...a sort of bulk discount."" Unfortunately, the conventional wisdom does not hold in the case of nuclear reactors. The more nuclear reactors that government attempts to build, the more it costs. The increased costs are largely due to a fierce worldwide competition for the resources, commodities and manufacturing capacity needed in the design and construction of new power plants. There are no compelling reasons for the government to pursue such an unsustainable energy policy, especially when there are better alternatives available. [3] ""My opponent says that the exuberant cost...what he stated."" I urge Pro to present more evidence regarding the cost of nuclear reactors. It is a known fact that cost of nuclear reactors always exceed the estimated budgets, sometimes by a margin of 200% ~300%. There are many things that work great on paper, but eventually fail miserably in reality. [3] ""He states that there is a very large safety issue with nuclear energy"" Two points: First, the numbers are at best misleading, and at worst devious. Coal industry, for example, is labor intense industry. Due to the high number of people employed in coal industry and relatively low efficiency in coal process, it is not surprised that its mortality rate is much higher than the rest of industry. Instead of measuring the relative safety by deaths per trillion KWhr, the paper should use percentage of deaths calculated by number of deaths over total number of employees. [4][5] Second, the safety concerns should not be measured by number of death alone. As what had happened in Chemobyl nuclear disaster: the number of death resulted from the explosion was no more than 40 people, but the incident was rated the worst nuclear disaster in human history. During a radioactive fire that burn for 10 days, 190 tons of highly toxic materials were expelled into the atmosphere. At the time of the accident, about 7 million people lived in contaminated territories, including 3 million children. Today, millions of people continue to exposed to high doses of radiation that would result in tumors, genetic mutations, and sever damage to the immune system. [5][6] In terms of long-term health impact, thyroid cancer in children has increased in the contaminated area since the disaster. The World Health Organization predicts that over 50,000 children will develop the disease because of the incidents. Moreover, incidence of leukemia has increased 50% in children and adults. In addition to thyroid cancer and leukemia, UNICEF reports that between 1990 and 1994, nervous system disorders increased by 43%; cardiovascular diseases by 43%; bone and muscle disorders by 62%; and diabetes by 28%. Number of birth defects and genetic mutations were also reported increased dramatically follow the incidents. Besides the long term health concerns, after the Chernobyl accident, almost 400,000 were forced leave their home for their own safety. The long term health social concerns cannot be captured by by mortality rate alone. [5][6] Therefore it is irrational to measure the safety issue merely on the basis of mortality rate. In the case of nuclear safety, the aforementioned mortality rate is next to meaningless. ""My opponent never says anything that...and the option is nuclear"" Nuclear is not the only option anymore. There is a range of cost-effective and more secured clean energy available: Solar power, wind power, and geothermal power. Natural gas is probably the best choice in the future.

Sf1a21db5-A27cbdce1	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"I would like to start my arguments for this round by going over the ethics of policy debate, for those judges who have not participated in it. My opponent has 1- Ignored several presses for evidence, saying he didn't need to show evidence because he turned my arguments around, which is not true. 2- Stated and restated information as fact but failed to show any proof ie. arguments about environmental effects and chance of getting fusion. 3- Attempted to add to his plan although this is not allowed, referring to his argument about the emergency budget cap. Although some judges may not understand the value of the strict rules and ethics of policy debate on an internet debate site, I urge you to remember that my opponent started this debate as a policy debate, but yet has ignored the rules and ethics of policy debate. My next arguments will flow from PRO's previous arguments. My opponent states that ""NO WHERE has he offered a direct disadvantage of passing the plan"" so I would like to remind the judges of several things, the low chance of success, the dangers with hazardous materials associated with deuterium, the environmental factor, and the possibility that the money will be used for other means because my opponent has not brought up any enforcement (ethically) during this debate. PRO says my arguments are not relevant to fusion energy but he has ignored the link between deuterium and fusion, the evidence is related to deuterium, deuterium is related to his case, linking my arguments to his case, PRO also states that the benefits outweigh the risk but has never once brought up evidence that we can be sure the benefits will even come, he has only stated it, but never backed his arguments. Until it is proven we must assume that the status quo -ie. not being able to obtain energy from fusion- will continue to be true. The third argument my opponent presents is a prime example of him ignoring my press for evidence, and showing that he cannot prove that we will ever get energy from fusion, he states that it will, but if you read back over this debate you will not see a single fact showing that we will get energy from fusion. My opponents next argument only refers to the process of obtaining fusion energy but ignores the amount of energy needed to harvest deuterium, although I have shown evidence that the amount of energy needed is very high. I believe that any open minded judge will be able to find the examples of bad things from this plan by looking over my arguments again. Again, we must assume that the status quo of not having fusion energy will remain, unless proven otherwise, and we have not seen any proof. This paragraph is what I refer to in point 3 of unethical debating at top, and I would like to reiterate that you may not add to your plan after you have stated it, making this argument void. The correlation my opponent attempts to make about money saved vs money used is flawed, the ""Billions upon billions of dollars is spent on fossil fuels"" as my opponent states comes from the pockets of citizens, the money spent in an attempt to obtain fusion energy would come from the government, yes the taxpayers give the government this money but think of this comparison if the plan doesn't work, which is likely, the people will still pay for fossil fuel, but will also pay more taxes to make up for the money our government would waste. This proves the same points I make in the paragraph before last. In this paragraph my opponent admits to denying my presses for evidence, and states that I do not provide any harms although I have clearly provided harms. I would like the judges consider a few things when they vote; 1- Will we really get fusion energy? My opponent offered no proof that we will. 2- Will fusion energy be all that it is said to be if we do get it? I have shown many environmental and economic effects in my previous arguments. 3- What will be the economic impact of this plan if it fails? I have shown that there are many opportunities for this plan to fail. 4- If this plan were to somehow work perfectly and all my last 3 points were void, how soon could it happen? My opponent has stated that it could be a century or more before we get fusion energy. If you the judge decide that I have failed to prove my opponent wrong, I would like you to reconsider the ethics of this debate, and decide if my opponent has won this debate ethically, and how much of an effect this will have on your decision."

Seaed4f92-A6463af82	Nuclear power plants should be torn down forever	"Thank you Pro. ""1. Nuclear power plants use Uranium as fuel which is scarce and will run out in 50-60 years. Therefore Nuclear power is not a renewable source of energy"" I don't know where you are getting your information but Uranium is effectively inexhaustible. As a matter of fact we can run for 80 years just on the Uranium we have now. Scientist do speculate that we will run out of fossil fuels in about 50-60 years though. Maybe you are confusing the two. ""2. The problem of radioactive waste is still an unsolved one. The waste from nuclear energy is extremely dangerous and it has to be carefully looked after for several thousand years (10'000 years according to United States Environmental Protection Agency standards)."" In this case you are absolutely correct, but only when Nuclear fission happens. Nuclear fusion's reactions are much safer and generate much less waste than fission. ""3.High risks: Despite a generally high security standard, accidents can still happen. It is technically impossible to build a plant with 100% security. A small probability of failure will always last. The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating both for human being as for the nature. 4. A meltdown in one of Russia's power plant had a MASSIVE leak of radiation in Chernobyl. the people there we're quarantined until all of the radiation could be removed. It would take 50 years maybe. That was roughly 20 years ago."" Again you are absolutely correct. There have been nine nuclear power plant related incidents and I believe there will be more. You can not make anything 100% safe. Lets look at automobiles. Just in the U.S alone 93 people die per day. Do we ban automobiles? No, because we don't have a better alternative, so we work at it till it gets safer and safer.

Sf074f79e-A7adfee2b	Nuclear Power	"Thank you to my opponent spaceman for this debate. I will be debating the Con position of....well, I'm not quite sure. I'm going to use this round to untangle Pro's opening statement, as the resolution ""Nuclear Power"" is a bit broad and vague. I'll take them one sentence at a time. 1. ""I would like to argue that Nuclear power as a technology, which have been largely underrated due to events such as Chernobyl, is detrimental to the environment more so than the danger radioactive substances."" Pro first argues that nuclear power, as a technology, which h(as) been largely underrated due to events such as Chernobyl, is detrimental to the environment more so that the danger(ous?) radioactive substances. Before we can make any sense out of this, we need to define what 'the danger radioactive substances' are. If Pro is referencing the dangerous radioactive substances that are produced as a by product of nuclear reactors, then his first statement could be interpreted as saying that Nuclear power, as a technological idea (as contrasted by physical manifestations of that technology, such as a nuclear reactor) is detrimental to the environment more so than radioactive substances produced by actual applications of Nuclear technology. That is to say, that the idea of Nuclear power is more dangerous than the actual radiation it produces. This is an absurd point to hold, and I would hope that this was not the intended meaning behind the statement. If this is not the case, then the 'danger radioactive substances' must be external from those produced as a by product of nuclear power as a technology, which would suggest that Pro is referencing radioactive elements that occur naturally in the environment. He would then be arguing that the idea of nuclear technology is more dangerous than the dangerous radioactive substances found in nature. I would countermand this argument by stating that a technological idea or advancement is not inherently dangerous until put into physical application, and I may have to pursue that idea further if this was in fact my opponent's meaning. 2. ""Although nuclear fission reactors have the downside of producing radioactive substances which take decades to decay to safe levels of emissions, Nuclear power has otherwise a safe history, and it could be argued has produced hardly and pollution relative to conventional fuel sources."" Here it is a bit easier to define a clear resolution made by Pro. I am interpreting this to mean that, other than the unfortunate property of radioactivity displayed by the waste produced in a nuclear reaction, nuclear power has had an otherwise safe history, and when compared to other conventional fuel sources, has produced less pollution. ""Pollution"" is a hard idea to quantify, I'm unsure if we are debating physical tonnage of pollutant, or the area affected by said pollution. Perhaps the number of people affected? I think 'detrimental to the environment' would be a bit clearer, but even then, are we talking in terms of area? Time the affected area is damaged? I could counter any of my opponents arguments to the contrary by positing that the effects of nuclear radiation are far more permanent than those caused by conventional fuel sources, and that the measure for danger must be hinged upon severity of the damage, rather than the amount of area it affects. So, to assemble all this into some kind of definable position: The resolution seems to be ""Nuclear Power"", which isn't really enough of a statement to debate. My opponent has taken a Pro position, which I am taking to mean that he is arguing in favor of nuclear power, all of its effects and applications as a whole. His major points seem to be: 1. Nuclear power, as a technology, has been demonized due to events like Chernobyl, and is in actuality less dangerous than radioactive isotopes produced by Nuclear reactors. 2. Other than producing dangerous radioactive waste as a by product, nuclear power has had an otherwise safe history. 3. When compared to other conventional fuel sources, Nuclear power causes less pollution. I am unsure by what rules we should constitute a victory. If burden must fall on me, as Con, to refute each point individually, assuming that victory on any one point would lead to Pro winning the resolution ""Nuclear Power: Yes."", then I will attempt to refute each point above. If not, and just one point must be negated by me to achieve victory, then pick your favorite from below. 1. This statement is a near contradiction in itself. The position that nuclear technology as an abstract idea is more inherently dangerous than the aggregate of all the dangerous substances produced as by product of that technology is ludicrous. Even if I were to cede that an idea, in and of itself, can be harmful without being acted upon, there is no way that an idea can be more dangerous than the affects it itself produces. Nonsense. 2. For me to win this point, I must simply show one example other than the generic waste produced under normal operation when nuclear power has been demonstrably unsafe. A quick visit to wikipedia shows that between 1952 and 2009 there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants ""...defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define major energy accidents that must be reported"" (source: wikipedia.com/wiki/Nuclear_Disasters) Anyway, I'll pick one at random. Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. 2 people died, $54,000,000 in damages and cleanup. If that's not enough, I'll keep referencing then until it is, there are 98 more on the wiki alone. 3. I am hesitant to debate this point until we come to a more concise definition of 'pollution', but I put forward that if I can show one example of a conventional fuel source that is less 'polluting' than nuclear power, then I will have won this point. Again, I'll reach into the random hat and pull one. Wind power. I welcome my opponent's responses, I hope he can shed some light as to his position in this debate, and clarify a few points that I may more accurately countermand his stance."	CON	342

That's just basic physics. For the sake of argument, I'll let you say you have perfectly efficient electrolysis, which is to say you have exactly as much energy in the hydrogen as you used on the water. -- That's a glorified battery! CORRECTION (so now I see we have switched to Physics to act like were a smart liberal) No, hydrogen is a FUEL. It is a GAS. It is an ELEMENT. a BATTERY is a SOLID ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL, with an ELECTROLYTE. Your nonsensical arguments about the source of hydrogen are irrelevant ERROR 6 * Unlike a real battery however, you have no ability to store more energy.

Rather it was saying the current limit to drive range was 7 miles in all electric mode up-bounded by the speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The range limit is low because batteries aren't designed for electric only mode and this is not a plug-in or electric model. The batteries only store about 1.3 kwh of power. Which by the way, works out to 0.185 kilowatt / mile or 2.8 cents a mile. That's 37% less than gasoline at $3.00 or $1.11 dollars a gallon. CORRECTION This completely nonsensical statement belies your complete and utter ignorance here are some FACTS (1) For the little crap Prius , it is about 57 kW in power http://www.toyota.com... (2) for a real SUV (toyota highlander) , it is about 270 HP in power http://www.carseek.com... For you, genius, 270 Hp at 1 HP = 0.766 kW = 206 kW So to be an ALL electric car, in one hour, you will need 57 kWh for the prius or 206 kWh for the Highlander Thus the hybrid is mostly using GASOLINE for now, NOT electricity ALL of your arguments for new batteries are NOT for cars, they are for computers and small EXPENSIVE things the HYBRID is the answer the fuel for the motor needs to transition to HYDROGEN, which is the ONLY fuel that can power everything and be scalable to any size.

S78068d61-Afaf71f39	Nuclear power should be banned	"~Refutation to the Pros case~ It seems as though my opponent seems to worry about the nuclear power being weaponized, and its byproducts. He implies weaponized as he diverges into nuclear weapons, and as I stated in the definitions this debate is about electricity. R1: Weaponization We are not arguing whether or not it is justified to have nuclear weapons, so I assume you mean they may be weaponized therefore need to be banned. This argument is fairly faulty. The technology to actually make uranium enriched enough to be used in weapons is a process that has nothing to do with nuclear power. [1] Further more the plants use techniques with the uranium basically rendering it useless for weaponize techniques. Nuclear fuel it enriched from 3-5%. [2] You need 90% enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. [3] Linking Nuclear weapons to nuclear power is absurd. [1] Also you claim their defense is less at risk. New Zealand is not like the US, they are peaceful and out of the way. [4] Their peace may not be their nuclear abolishment, rather they do not patrol the middle east. R2: Waste My opponents main case is the waste. He claims the waste is unstoppable and radioactive. Lets refute first his views on the storage. Many plants store them in huge metal vaults (under security big time) filled with water, this keeps the radiation inside. [5] The waste actually overtime becomes non hazardous. [6] The EPA and the NRC constantly regulate and check the disposal to make sure the storage is safe, unlike you claim. [6] Further more my opponent claims a byproduct so ""large"". This is actually false. The Nuclear industry actually emits less byproducts then other industries. [7] The only waste problem that you cite that makes any sense is what the waste is. Also the nuclear industry takes FULL responsibility for their waste is any problem occurs. (like they have to pay for it). [8] Why does this matter? Because they now have a financial reason to keep the storage system safe. Nuclear actually emits less waste then coal. [8, 9] (this ties in next). Methods for Safer underground storage sites are being researched. [8] Then my opponent claims the byproducts from nuclear are the most hazardous. Before we do this, let me cite things about our buddy coal. Well our buddy coal has more radioactive waste then Nuclear. [10] Who would have though that? Well sorry coal, we are not buddies anymore. Now, as I have proven Nuclear waste is stored with great regulation hindering it safe. Now, what about the byproducts from, lets say solar? Some solar cells have many nasty byproducts as well. They use many toxic materials. [11] Now, how is this worse then nuclear? Nuclear Stores the waste in safe facilities, whereas solar cannot store the waste. So in a comparison your argument is false as coal is already more radioactive, and solar has toxic byproducts that are not even stored. Further more (economically speaking) solar has a terrible type of problem: China. China imports most of the solar cells in the US. [12] Also objections to the nuclear power/weapon see above. Defense of my case ~ Jobs ~ My opponent claims this is false. As I stated the nuclear industry woudl make 3,000 jobs or more per plant. The Solar industry can only make 10,000 new jobs total. [13] In this case Nuclear is better then this green energy. For wind, 11% of the jobs are building the turbine, 5% for maintenance. [14] Why is this significant? Because this means 15% of the jobs wind creates are temporary jobs. The Nuclear business has 56,000 people working for it. banning this energy means 50,000 people lose jobs. [15] ~ Cost of nuclear Power ~ My opponent claims it costs 109$ per killowatt hour. I disagree: ""Since 1987 the cost of producing electricity from has decreased from 3.63 cents per KWHr to 1.68 cents per KWHr in 2004 and plant availability has increased from 67% to over 90%."" [16] 2$ is far off from what you claim! Nuclear Power is cheaper then all of the fossil fuel types, and competes with coal, a very cheap Fossil Fuel. [17] Also this: ""The nation’s 103 nuclear reactors were the lowest cost electricity producers of any source of expandable, baseload electricity in 2002."" [18] ~ Safety ~ ""I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. ""~ My opponent He basically conceded, and is only saying he is worried of a melt down. The NRC has many rules and regulations so it would be harder for melt-down situations to occur. [19] ""the design and operation of nuclear power plants aims to minimise the likelihood of accidents, and avoid major human consequences when they occur. "" [20] My opponent forgets the only accident recently is fukishima, which could be easily prevented with newer reactors. Chernobyl for example was due to a flawed design. Newer designs and regulations prevent these instances. As these accidents are rare, and when the happen are easily controlled (3 mile island) [21], and therefore your argument is mainly a consesion as these instances are rare and are easily controllable. The workers in these plants have rigorous training and can prevent and be able to stop the incident occurs, and control it if prevention measures fail. [22] ~Green energies~ My opponent first goes after the emissions. My opponent concedes they Emmit's less emissions than solar. His counter is the construction. If It emits less then it will eventually even out and bet solar. There are actually methods that make nuclear powers uranium last forever by getting uranium from the sea. [23] So your worry is over... Also as I stated last round, these reactors work on thorium too, therefore will last longer there too. Worry on your part over. *Low on room* Conclusion My opponent has not fulfilled his BOP (he has it all, 1st round) and in my opinion has no reasons to do with the energy forever. http://www.nei.org...

This is mutually exclusive with affirming as clearly you cannot propose it with total costs and propose it with 3545467.5 times as much costs at the same time. This is beneficial because prices this high will mean people will continue to rely on fossil fuels and thus contribute to global warming. Global warming is good because: A) Warming is good in that warming promotes peace and stability: Warmer is better- history proves it facilitates peace. Idso et al., Ph.D Soil Science, 11/16/05 (Sherwood, Keith and Craig Idso, ""War and Social Unrest- Summary"" http://www.co2science.org... 7/20/08) Craig Idso 1 writes ""What is the connection between rising air temperatures and CO2 concentrations and social stability? Zhang et al. (2005) note that historians typically identify political, economic, cultural and ethnic unrest as the chief causes of war and civil strife. However, the five Chinese scientists argue that climate plays a key role as well; and to examine their thesis, they compared proxy climate records with historical data on wars, social unrest and dynastic transitions in China from the late Tang to Qing Dynasties (mid-9th century to early 20th century). This work revealed that war frequencies, peak war clusters, nationwide periods of social unrest and dynastic transitions were all significantly associated with cold phases of China's oscillating climate. More specifically, all three distinctive peak war clusters (defined as more than 50 wars in a 10-year period) occurred during cold climatic phases, as did all seven periods of nationwide social unrest and nearly 90 percent of all dynastic changes that decimated this largely agrarian society. As a result, they concluded that climate change was ""one of the most important factors in determining the dynastic cycle and alternation of war and peace in ancient China,"" with warmer climates having been immensely more effective than cooler climates in terms of helping to ""keep the peace."""" End quote. War and disrupting society must be stopped at all costs due to the fact that in todays world people don't just go stab each other with pitch forks we have nuclear weapons. This is important because: 1) We have already several times come close to nuclear war and there are many countries that keep their fingers on the trigger, and who knows what this extra crises could do? 2) This isn't just a few more wars, the statistics show that almost 90% of all major wars and zones of dynastic change happened during cold periods. Furthermore this outweighs on magnitude as nuclear war would destroy all possible life on the planet as it is toxic to everything and is not limited or prevented by factors like height and is not survivable.

History bears out that desperate nations take desperate actions."" As an example, suppose a starving North Korea launches nuclear weapons upon Japan and South Korea, including U.S. forces there, in a spasmodic suicidal response. Or suppose a desperate China, whose long-range nuclear missiles (some) can reach the United States, attacks Taiwan. In addition to immediate responses, the mutual treaties involved in such scenarios will quickly draw other nations into the conflict, escalating it significantly. Strategic nuclear studies have shown for decades that, under such extreme stress conditions, once a few nukes are launched, adversaries and potential adversaries are then compelled to launch on perception of preparations by one's adversary. The real legacy of the MAD concept is this side of the MAD coin that is almost never discussed. Without effective defense, the only chance a nation has to survive at all is to launch immediate full-bore pre-emptive strikes and try to take out its perceived foes as rapidly and massively as possible. As the studies showed, rapid escalation to full WMD exchange occurs."" Thus nuclear war on any level results in an infinite chain of escalation till extinction occurs. B) Without increases global warming the world will lapse into famine. Keith and creig idso write Idso, Craig and Keith (Ex-Director of Environmental Science at Peabody Energy in St. Louis, and Ph.D. in Geography from Arizona State University. PhD in Botany from Arizona State University. ""Biofuels as religious fodder"" http://www.co2science.org...) 1/30/2008 ""Borlaug notes, for example, that ""for the foreseeable future, plants - especially the cereals - will continue to supply much of our increased food demand, both for direct human consumption and as livestock feed to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for meat in the newly industrializing countries."" In fact, he states that ""the demand for cereals will probably grow by 50% over the next 20 years and even larger harvests will be needed if more grain is diverted to produce biofuels."" Noting that most food increases of the future ""will have to come from lands already in productio],"" and that ""70% of global water withdrawals are for irrigating agricultural lands,"" Borlaug's facts suggest that crop water use efficiency (biomass produced per unit of water used) will have to be increased dramatically if we are to meet humanity's food needs of the future without creating the disastrous consequences he outlines above; and it should be evident to all but those most blinded to the truth that this requirement can only be met if biofuels are not a part of the picture, while the aerial fertilization and anti-transpiration effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment are. Although Borlaug notes that conventional plant breeding, improvements in crop management, tillage, fertilization, and weed and pest control, as well as genetic engineering, will help significantly in this regard, we will in all likelihood need the beneficial biological byproducts of concomitant increases in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration in addition. Without them, to borrow a chilling phrase from Borlaug, ""efforts to halt global poverty will grind to a halt,"" and much of the world of nature will be no longer."" End quote. Thus famines are an inventible outcome since grain is a staple food of most of the world and so the amount of grain feeding the world would be so far behind the need that there would be millions of starving people. This outweighs on probability as global warming has no exact known effects while poverty while idso explains that the grain production MUST increase by 50% over the next 20 years if it wants to remain anywhere near the demand, and this is unrealistic in our situation now. Therefore the sole workable solution that can possibly be effective and possible to afford is to increase CO2 levels.

S1ff2ec96-A8214deb5	The united states federal government should offer tax incentives for offshore wind turbines	I thank my opponent for the awsome round and now I will procceed to rebut the resolution. Please note that my opponent has rebuted in the summary round and although this is against the rules technically I will just assume that We are both rebutting and concluding in the same round. Let's begin: Inherency A.) Ships My opponent’s use of analytical argumentation is invalid. I have given quoted evidence that no ships are available and are tied up in the upcoming years which has not been refuted. The burden of proof relies completely on the Pro team, as he is proposing a plan. This means that he would have to show quoted and/or cited evidence proving the necessary amount of ships exist for hire to accomplish the plan. Simple as that. B.) Onshore wind The evidence that Pro provided must be dropped because the source he provided no longer works and thus I cannot check his facts. (see: Thaler 12 http://papers.ssrn.com......;) C.) Economies of scale Again Pro’s citation doesn’t match his evidence. I went to his citation and did a F3: search for multiple parts of his speech yet there were zero results. Please drop this evidence and disregard these statements. Global Warming A.) Alternative is coal/ coal ash is radioactive These points are mute. While coal may be radioactive it is not nearly as radioactive as radioactive waste from rare earth metals or regular nuclear waste. Pro has shown no evidence otherwise, and therefore we must assume that radioactive waste from rare earths is far more damaging then coal. There is a reason that we bury nuclear waste and not coal ash. Finally Pro attempts to say that we cant control what china does anyways and that increasing its demand for things that create nuclear waste will somehow convince them to change. The reason these problems exist in the first place is that China Does Not Care about its environment or its impoverished who are being ravaged by illness, as a humanitarian nation we cannot support the destruction of lives or the corruption of the Chinese corporations. B.) Methane The opponent has not responded to my evidence with evidence to support a counter theory and thus he concedes that it is true simply because my evidence specifically indicates that it is Too late to reverse global warming because of the methane feedback loop. He responds analytically which is honestly an irrelevant type of response being that it warrants nothing. Please flow this argument to me as well. Conclusion: The Affirmative/Pro team has not been effective in the slightest in affirming the resolution, nor in demonstrating any real benefits of increasing tax credits to offshore wind. He has also, on multiple occasions, provided false evidence and left his burden of proof unfulfilled while also straight dropping arguments I made in my First Constructive speech. I on the other hand have effectively revealed the weakness of the offshore wind energy in its double smack effects on your wallet through high energy prices and the tax to pay for the subsidy as a whole. I have proven that doing the plan will create tons of nuclear waste, added onto the total the wind energy sector has Already created, (over 7 million tons) not even including all of the other poisonous gasses that are released in the process of rare earth creation. This will result in the death hundreds if not thousands of Chinese workers added onto the livestock and bodily damage that radiation stemmed diseases cause. Note that the Pro team has conceded that the US economy is fine now and that there is no need to take any risks with offshore wind and thus has conceded the entire round. All of this remains true and I haven’t even re-mentioned that the plan is impossible due to the fact that no ships exist to create the turbines themselves.

Several environmentalists have talked about the difference between ‘bridge’ technologies which can provide a temporary solution and long term, sustainable technologies.

Sf074f877-A389f9ae3	Nuclear Power	"Thanks, Smooosh. I. Breeder Reactors Pro argues that breeder reactors are expensive, unreliable, and are susceptible to terrorism. Shipping plutonium would be a rare event, largely because breeder reactors can make their own plutonium. ""[T]he number of neutrons produced per plutonium-239 fission is 25% more than from uranium, and this means that there are enough (after losses) not only to maintain the chain reaction but also continually to convert U-238 into more Pu-239...So, the fast reactor 'burns' and 'breeds' fissile plutonium...Both U-238 and Pu-240 are 'fertile' (materials), i.e. by capturing a neutron they become...fissile Pu-239 and Pu-241 respectively."" [1] In other words, breeder reactors would only require an initial shipment of plutonium before basically becoming self-sufficient. This minimizes the risk of terrorist attacks on plutonium shipments. The same holds true for uranium. Breeder reactors could reduce the risk of plutonium-related terror by reducing the world's plutonium supplies. Regarding civilian plutonium waste, ""much of that British plutonium...has been extracted from spent fuel with the intention of using it to power an earlier generation of fast reactors that were never built. This makes it much more vulnerable to theft and use in nuclear weapons than plutonium still held inside spent fuel, as most of the U.S. stockpile is."" [2] Plutonium stockpiles are already sitting around. Either we use it as fuel, or we bury it and isolate it for thousands of years. Pro has repeatedly railed against the latter option as dangerous and potentially calamitous for the environment, so it seems wiser to simply use it up as fuel. Moreover, no one has even built a geological repository for this kind of plutonium. [2] Since plutonium reactors can be run in different ways (i.e. to maximize plutonium creation, to stabilize plutonium levels, or to destroy plutonium introduced into the system) breeder reactors are capable of both destroying these reserves and later being adapted to stabilize the amount of plutonium (so no new shipments or mining). [2] Such a process would reduce the net amount of available plutonium reserves in the world, decreasing the risk that such material could be used for nefarious ends, including in terrorism. This plan would also prevent the creation of the kind of waste storage sites Pro objects to. It's a win-win. Simply put, ""[t]he plutonium stockpiles have to be dealt with. The only viable alternative to re-use is burial, which carries its own risks, and continued storage, with vast expense and unknowable security hazards to present and countless future generations."" Since breeder reactors are the only way to eliminate these stockpiles, we need to be investing in breeder technology. [2] As for the other issues, Pro says that breeder reactor technology has been ""expensive to create."" Firstly, developing the technology and implementing it are different issues, and it seems that, overtime, breeder reactors would likely recoup any initial losses by substantially reducing the expenses related to uranium and plutonium mining and shipment. Recall that in breeder reactors, the cost of uranium supplies is reduced ""by more than a factor of 100."" [3] Secondly, even if Pro were to demonstrate that breeder reactors are costly, that is not the same thing as proving that their utility does not justify their cost, however usurious that cost may be. Finally, the issues of reliability Pro talks about, and also his arguments regarding cost, seem to hinge (based on a quick reading of his sources) on a single bungled test reactor experiment in India and an example in Japan, which went afoul more because of administrative incompetence than anything else, as the article notes. Neither of these cases indicate inherent flaws in the technologies or plants themselves. II. Too Long to Build I looked at Pro's source, and at the source Pro's source cited. I found no substantiation for the claim that 300 to 400 new reactors would be needed in the next 30-50 years. I found precisely one reference to this statistic in the original report, buried on page 58. It reads in part: ""If the number of nuclear reactors in the United States is to double or triple over the next 30 to 50 years, however, and the number worldwide is to grow ten-fold--as would be needed to have a large impact on greenhouse gas emissions."" [4] Forgive me if I don't find this un-sourced claim particularly inspiring. It is also interesting to note that this same report, on page 109, argues for expanding nuclear energy, not curtailing it. [5] If Pro is going to endorse the claim on page 58, he should not be able to avoid endorsing the claim on page 109. Even so, the example of France--which was dropped completely by Pro earlier--is a key success story in regard to rapid decarbonization. It manage to rapidly expand its nuclear capacity from the early 1980s to 2007 (a little under 30 years). In conjunction with the nuclear program, it also increase hydroelectric plants, so that 90% of its power was supplied by those two sources in 2007 (75% by nuclear alone). This more than meets the 60-80% goal within the timelimits given. France also used some innovative techniques to assist in the rapid development of nuclear power: ""the most important aspect of French nuclear policy is its procurement strategy, which is centered on producing one standard nuclear technology, the pressurized water reactor...By focusing on a single type of reactor, the government encouraged standardization, economies of scale, rapid construction and quick installation in the emerging nuclear industry."" [5] If other countries replicate the French model, it is not inconceivable that the danger threshold could be averted in time. This is empirically demonstrates that what I propose can be done. It's also worth mentioning that I, of course, am not arguing for nuclear power to the exclusion of all other sources. I think nuclear is a key part of our energy portfolio, but, as with France, it should be combined with other useful energy sources. Also, I do not need to endorse ""complete"" decarbonization--only 60-80% decarbonization. Finally, Pro makes some vague mention about in-home energy sources, saying: ""Energy storing batteries may not be able to store enough energy yet, but I wonder what this debate will be like 5 or even 10 years from now."" But that is just the point: all Pro can do is wonder. There has been scant evidence in this debate that things like the Powerwall will be able to solve in time. Pro is trying to create a panacea out of hopes, dreams, and optimism--none of which happen to be concrete data and none of which always materialize in the face of an oftentimes frustrating and difficult world. III. Terrorism Pro gives no reason why nuclear terror is unique to my world. Recall that we already have large stores of fissile material that are not simply going to vanish if nuclear plants shutdown. If a nuclear terrorist incident is inevitable, it is inevitable no matter which side prevails. We cannot even know if the incident would be worse in one world or another because such arguments boil down to mere speculation. To make a true nuclear bomb, terrorists would need highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium. [6] Regarding the latter, I've already explained how negating could make terrorists using plutonium less likely. Regarding the former, HEU is currently being phased out of most of the reactors that use it, in favor of LEU. [7] This policy ought to continue, and would significantly impede efforts by terrorists to make a Hiroshima-esque bomb, or even something less grandiose. Pro adds that I haven't shown that people need to be background checked in order to access nuclear plants. I would've thought that self-evident, but there is evidence which supports my assertion. [8] I would also posit that it is more likely than not that nuclear technicians will have more thorough security checks than airlines pilots given the sensitivity of their jobs and of the technology they work with. Even in states unfriendly to the West, e.g. North Korea, understand that it would be idiotic not to secure their nuclear facilities. IV. Bailouts Firstly, my opponent lambastes breeder reactors as costly to develop, yet justifies massive subsidies for renewables because those subsidies are there to support new industries. This is hypocritical on its face. Even if the technology existed before, it is now being deployed on a scale it never had been before. In that sense, it is a new industry. Why support subsidies for one, but not the other? Secondly, the subsidies for renewables are still there to stop them failing. If the argument is that bailing out companies that couldn't otherwise survive is bad, then we ought not to be bailing out renewables either. Thirdly, nuclear will likely recoup its costs, as shown earlier. Fourthly, Pro never really contests that keeping energy costs down through subsidies benefits the economy. Finally, since we're using a cost-benefit analysis weighing calculus in this debate, Pro's ethical concerns about taxpayers are simply irrelevant. They don't weigh. V. Drops Since R4 is Pro's last speech, he cannot rebut anything he has dropped so far, per the rules against new arguments. Pro has dropped a lot--that thermal pollution is irrelevant, the OECD data, the levelized cost data, the Tesla Powerwall's pitfalls, that nuclear plants don't need back-up generators, and all four arguments under ""Terrorism"" in my R3, not to mention all the drops I noted under ""Drops"" in R3. These points are all now untouchable. I'll impact them next round. VI.

S53275be8-Ad7d91bfc	Nuclear power is clean and emits significantly less CO2 than other renewable energy sources	"Nuclear power plants are not much of an improvement over conventional coal-burning power plants despite claims that nuclear is the 'clean air energy.' Uranium mining, milling, leeching, plant construction and decommissioning all produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases. Taking into account the carbon-equivalent emissions associated with the entire nuclear life cycle, not just the nuclear fission itself, nuclear plants contribute significantly to climate change and will contribute even more as stockpiles of high grade uranium are depleted1. Nuclear waste can remain radioactive for thousands of years. It must be stored for all this time away from water into which it can dissolve and far from any tectonic activity. This is virtually impossible and there are serious concerns over the state of waste discarded even a few decades ago. A report by the Environment Agency attacked Britain's disposal system as many containers used to store the waste are made of second-rate materials, are handled carelessly, and are liable to corrode; computer models suggest up to 40% of them could be at risk of being compromised within as little as 200 years2. Tens of thousands of containers of this waste, bound in concrete, are simply being stored above ground, mainly at Sellafield, while the Government and the nuclear industry decide what to do with them. On present plans it is assumed they will remain there for up to another 150 years before being placed in a repository underground, and then another 50 years before it is sealed3. This problem would only be added to if more nuclear power stations were built. 1The case against nuclear power"". Greenpeace.

These costs, while usually external for other technologies, are internal for nuclear power. Costs are high compared to coal fired generation precisely because the externalities associated with high carbon outputs are not taken into account, whereas similar externalities relating to nuclear generation are. If costs are calculated equivalently to coal power stations then nuclear power is competitive. Also the cost of construction and decommissioning of nuclear power plants is often overestimated; the French and Swedish nuclear industries estimate decommissioning costs to be just 10 -15 % of the construction costs and budget this into the price charged for electricity1. Nuclear is actually increasing its competitiveness as gas and oil prices rise, new technology makes nuclear power more efficient and construction and decommissioning costs less.

If we used algae... it'd take the land size of maryland. see the wiki links."" ---You're correct, I didn't. But even then, you're saying that it will take the size of Maryland, and already you're wasting all that land for the production of a fuel that will eventually lead to more gasoline usage anyways. My argument here is that regardless of how much land it uses, the water consumed is unnecessary and will only lead to more global warming anyways. There are multiple impact levels to my argument. ""Your argument seems to be that goverment intervention is by definition the least economical way to do things... but you don't provide any arguments to refute my points other than vague ""invisible hand"" rhetoric. (and some misguided factual info on your part)"" ---I have no solid opinion on government intervention in general, and I don't think you're right in placing me under that umbrella of judgement when I have given you no points that would lead you to that sort of conclusion. In fact, I have even advocated government intervention. ""You're finding so many ways to actually avoid actually arguing th point of the debate with me. "" ---I am, again, arguing the premises of your points and disregarding the rest: The rest, being this whole money thing you're talking about. What I'm saying is that all this money doesn't matter, because affirming this topic will only lead to the overusage and unnecessary usage of water, along with the unnecessary usage of more oil. It doesn't matter if Ethanol will get 'cheaper', because the environment outweighs the economy, and EVEN IF that's a new argument and a different debate, I still prove that you impact back worse to the economy because you're causing unnecessary land usage and PRO uses more oil than CON does. ""I acknowledged raising the fuel standard would mean we shouldn't be using ethanol, right now. I said we'd have to postpone intervention till later, perhaps. This is just a misreading on your part, and doesn't attack whether the gov should intervene at some time. "" ---If you acknowledge, you negate. I said it's a counterplan, which means we raise the MPG standards INSTEAD of intervening and funding corporations in the alternative fuel field. To the audience: Since my opponent has basically agreed that my position is correct, you vote for me. As for this whole ""doesn't attack if the government should intervene"".... I've responded to this already, and since it's basically her only defense left against all the responses I've already made to her case, she basically has already lost. ""Plus, you might not be so right abotu the factual nature of th sitaution, ie how much water is used or land.. etc. So you need to argue other things more."" ---Okay, so if you choose to disregard my evidence because it ""might not be right"", that also applies to your evidence, This sort of argument is nonunique; it's a problem that's inherent in all statistics. Alright, I agree that my evidence doesn't work at all. But then that means yours doesn't work either. Therefore you get no impacts and therefore there is absolutely no reason to vote PRO. ""THen you can afford to buy cars, and you're better off than most people. Even if you're poor and you put all your money into cars, you're the exception to th e rule. The general rule is that, and this is common knowledge so i'm not sure why I'm even debating this, poorer people get their cars from the richer. Most people drive used cars. This is not rocket science. "" ---Thank you for clarifying this in R3. I get the same impacts in the sense that if there is instead funding of alternative energy and the implementation of a law that states MPG must be higher by some year, then that means poor people will be driving those cars later; you can cross-apply my arguments to come to the conclusion that if we use these ethanol cars that you're talking about, then the poor people will just be using those cars later, and that leads to more gasoline usage, and more ehtanol usage, whichis more water usage, blah blah blah stuff I talked about in R2. ""and he thinks wind power can get us off gasoline in five years.... that's very hard to believe cars and all that would work."" ---Just because some of the things he says seems ridiculous to you doesn't mean that the fact that I cited him for, 12,000 gallons of water to produce one gallon of ethanol, is false. And even then, I'd argue that it's not ridiculous at all, it's just ridiculous to you: The words OBVIOUS, REASONABILITY, FEASABILITY, and RIDICULOUS are all specific to our own cultures and experiences. Just because something seems ridiculous to you doesn't mean it seems ridiculous to some other people, and EVEN THEN, just because it seems ridiculous doesn't mean it is suddenly false. ""you've avoided this issue, the whole poit of this debate, like the plaque."" ---I am not avoiding it at all. If you want to talk about government intervention, that's another debate. I'm saying that funding alternative fuels, and you basically talk about ethanol, I'm saying that funding that area at all is BAD. Therefore if I attack one of the premise needed to affirm, I'm doing my job. (Is it just me, or am I just repeating myself?) So basically since DairyGirl has not responded to my case AT ALL, every single impact I have talked about since R1 still holds true, and that means Ethanol has lower MPG, that measn that 12,000 gallons of water will still be used to produce one gallon of ethanol, that means she still bites into all the impacts I place on her, and that already is enough reason to negate the topic, But even then you can look to my case and you can see clearly that the counterplans that I propose, se; the usage of that same money to fund alternative ENERGY instead of alternative FUEL, and the implementation of more liberal laws, leads to much better results and has none of the harms and disadvantage that her case causes."

Sae50ee6c-A2c4d20cd	The US Should Subsidize Nuclear Power	"Urgency Pro says the government could speed up NP construction. That is very unlikely. Constructing NP involves so many variables, millions of moving parts, and is always susceptible to human error and unanticipated cost overruns. The US already does everything it can to speed construction, yet construction still takes much longer than projected. [20] Of 66 plants “under construction,” nine have been so for 20 years, four for 10 years, 45 have no start-up date, and 23 have experienced significant, protracted construction delays. [21] In fact, Pro's entire argument rests on outdated projections for the Vogtle and Virgil plants. The Vogtle expansion was originally to be completed in 2016 and 2017. But delays and cost overruns have pushed the schedule back to 2019 and 2020. [18] And “additional challenges in its fabrication, assembly, delivery, and installation of the shield building and structural modules” could lead to even more delays and added costs. The SCE&G plant has also been delayed until 2019 and 2020. [19] As such, construction time for these plants is closer to 13 or 14 years, and further delays may extend construction time beyond that. Pro's idea that we could speed up construction is simply absurd. And Pro's other idea, turning coal plants into NP, is also absurd. NP plants are far larger installations than coal, requiring complex infrastructure and millions of parts that coal plants lack. [20] Finally, there simply aren't enough engineers with the required expertise to build new NP plants; there aren't even enough to sustain current levels of NP let alone to build new plants. [21] WWS can replace coal much faster than NP. And as a result, WWS leads to cumulative greenhouse gas savings. Studies show that these cumulative savings make WWS seven times more effective at fighting climate change than NP. [3] [20] [26] That alone is reason to vote Con in this debate. Remember, Pro admits that global warming poses a threat to human survival. Pro also recognizes the urgency in solving this problem. Solving the problem of climate change as quickly as possible needs to be our #1 priority. The best solution is investing in WWS, not NP. Costs The market supports WWS. [21] It doesn't support NP. Even 100% construction subsidies offered to new US reactors since 2005, plus operating subsidies slightly greater than those formerly given to wind, have failed to attract private capital. [24] The market doesn't lie. To argue that NP is cheaper than WWS is absurd. Investing in NP over WWS will cost the US billions. Pro drops almost all my evidence. In particular, Pro drops that wind and water are significantly cheaper than NP. Pro drops that prices for WWS are decreasing (note: by 2017, solar prices will decrease another 40%, as cell efficiency increases and the cost of panels decreases). [25] Pro drops that the price of NP is increasing, as uranium ores are being depleted. Pro drops the fact that producing NP already costs double that of recent solar installations. And Pro drops the huge costs of waste storage, the costs of cleanup after a meltdown, and the costs of decommissioning NP plants, most of which isn't taken into account in any of Pro's sources. Instead, Pro focuses solely on upfront costs. Three problems with Pro's argument: First, investors don't care about upfront costs; they care about lifetime costs. All my evidence, which Pro drops, refers to lifetime costs, not upfront costs. This explains why investors are so interested in WWS while showing no interest in NP. Ironically, Pro says investors aren't interested in NP because of NP's high upfront costs; at the same time, Pro says NP is cheap based on an analysis of upfront costs. Second, Pro's only sources don't cite any studies, don't say where their numbers come from, what their methodology is, or anything that makes the source credible. In effect, Pro's sources are much like Pro's arguments: bare assertions without any substantiation. Third, Pro's numbers are wrong. [Pro's 8] says NP construction costs are $6500 per kW. But that number is low. FPL recently said its NP units were at least $8000 per kW. [20] And a study found that construction costs quoted by trade associations and industry suppliers are misleadingly incomplete because they exclude expenses related to procuring land, building cooling towers and switchyards, interest during construction, inflation, cost overruns, and contingency fees. [20] The study noted that costs typically double when these excluded items are included. Other sources show that NP construction costs have historically exceeded projections by up to 1200%. [22] Pro's own examples, the Vogtle and SCE&G plants, are good examples of cost overruns. [Pro's 8] says construction costs for solar are $2000 per kW, but are actually $8000 because it runs at 25% efficiency. How do we know the numbers are accurate? We don't because Pro's source simply asserts them without any empirical evidence. Every legitimate source shows actual construction costs of solar around $3000 per kW. [20] [27] Unsurprisingly, Pro misunderstands what the 25% number refers to: solar PV's efficiency at converting sunlight into energy. [20] and [27] already take this number into account. And as technology improves, efficiency will improve, lowering the cost even further. [25] Environment Pro says NP displaces more carbon per dollar than WWS. But Pro ignores carbon produced in mining, milling, and enriching uranium, unanticipated construction delays and cost overruns, waste storage construction, decommissioning, and millennia-long storage of waste. There is plenty of carbon in this footprint that isn't computed in [Pro's 14]. More specifically, [Pro's 14] fails to acknowledge the astronomic carbon footprint from storing waste for thousands of years. And [Pro's 14] fails to consider cumulative savings from WWS's faster deployment. Amory Lovins, an American physicist and one of the world's top energy experts, took into account all these factors and found that WWS ""protects the climate sevenfold more than shifting a dollar of spending from coal to nuclear."" [26] Lovins explains that ""for a power source merely to emit no carbon isn't good enough; it must also produce the least carbon per dollar, and must do so sooner that its competitors."" The keyword there is ""sooner."" [Pro's 14] simply ignores much of NP's carbon footprint, including waste storage and all the cumulative greenhouse gas savings from WWS's faster deployment. Other studies confirm these results. [3] [20] Plus, the cost of WWS is decreasing, while the cost of NP is increasing, so the amount of carbon WWS displaces per dollar will continue to increase. Meanwhile, as price of NP increases, NP will displace less carbon per dollar than it already does. NP plants also continuously emit cancer-causing strontium-90 radiation during regular operation. Multiple studies show that radioactive strontium-90 emissions during routine operations increase cancer rates among those who live near NP plants. [21] Security Pro admits that expanding NP also proliferates nuclear weapons. This poses a massive security risk, because it creates more opportunities for rogue states and terrorists to obtain radioactive materials and create their own weapons of mass destruction. Every ton of separated plutonium waste from NP has enough material for 110 nuclear weapons. [20] And there's no shortage of rogue states and terrorist groups eager to acquire this waste to make nuclear bombs. The risks are real. Authorities have documented over 917 incidents of nuclear smuggling, and those are only the incidents we know about. [20] Pro says a plane hijacking is unlikely, but we know the risk is real, since 9/11 happened. NP plants are prone to terrorist attack and sabotage. And if we expand NP, the risk of terrorist attack increases, as terrorists acquire more potential targets. In response, the US will need to invest in more security for NP plants, uranium mines, and waste storage sites, which would further increase the costs of NP. And even then, no amount of security can guarantee that NP plants won't be targeted by terrorists. WWS don't have any security risks. Reliability Pro says NP provides more energy than WWS. That's irrelevant. WWS can provide all our energy needs plus more by 2030. That's enough energy. WWS is ""more reliable than current arrangements"" if properly distributed. [26] And there's more than enough wind, water, and sunlight in the US to create a reliable WWS power grid. [3] [20] Pro's lack of sources on this point is telling. In contrast, NP often fails unexpectedly; 27% of US plants have failed. Yes, hydro is affected by extreme weather too, but it recovers much faster than NP (full NP recovery takes years). [26] And WWS still withstands extreme weather better because it's decentralized. Meltdowns The risk of a meltdown in the US is even higher than it was at Fukushima. [23] Indeed, using the most advanced probabilistic risk assessment tools, a team at MIT estimated at least four serious accidents between now and 2055. [20] That is an unacceptable risk. And this analysis was done assuming no new NP plants. If we expand NP, the probabilistic risk increases. There's no way to design around these risks because they're caused by human errors made during small accidents that cascade to complete failure. And small accidents happen all the time. Between 1942 and 2007, there were 956 small accidents. [20] Fusion The fusion/thorium currently being produced is an experimental project and over 30 years from completion.

S9bc8d269-Aab4fd4d7	Solar power stores energy in environmentally hazardous batteries.	Solar power is generally stored in lead-acid batteries. These batteries contain lead and sulphuric acid which are toxic to air, soil, water, and marine life. While 98% of the materials in dead batteries are recoverable, they would require require greater regulations that do not yet exist and which may be difficult to enforce.	PRO	368
S8b68ae4-A7b4d8f1b	Centralized nuclear energy production is inefficient.	Whenever electricity is transferred across wires, some of its electrical current is lost. The longer the distance, the more electricity loss occurs. Because there are few nuclear power plants, the average distance that the produced electricity has to travel is quite long. The result is an inefficient loss of electrical energy. More decentralized forms of renewable energy are superior.	PRO	369
S4b391e77-Ab18684b2	The US should encourage more nuclear energy use over current widely used energy forms.	OK, I know someone just did something like this, but I like the idea and I like to argue about nuclear power, so yeah. Please no stealing arguments from that debate, or at least as little as possible and in your own words. Thank you! OK, the United States currently uses mainly (51%) coal power [1] and this causes, among other things, acid rain, smog, lung damage, contamination of lakes and rivers, birth defects, and radiation releases. (Now, you'll say nuclear energy releases more, but I'll cover that later, so hold on.) This all comes from the tens of thousands of TONS of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ash, sludge, mercury and other chemicals. These are harmful to our environment and the people of the United States. Nuclear energy can reduce this harm if it is used to gradually reduce or eliminate the use of coal and other fossil-fuels. This is because nuclear energy produces virtually no air pollution [3] and nuclear energy actually produces 100 times less radiation than does coal [4]. But all that is just from producing energy, what about getting the fuel? Well, we would mine less if we used uranium for power, as you'd need less uranium to produce the same amount of energy, 20,000 times less to be exact [5]. All these advantages of nuclear power mentioned are good, but they only cover health and the environment. Let's expand the view of this debate to look at other advantages of nuclear energy, specifically economics. Nuclear plants can create up to 1,800 temporary jobs and 1,400 permanent jobs. They can also generate $430 million for local economies [6] and this is only looking at the plants themselves, not at manufacturing parts, research, or other industries that would be stimulated. Now let's look at the costs of building and maintaining. Nuclear plants cost less overall than does the advanced type of coal with sequestration that is now being researched and is the future of coal [7]. And, while coal is increasing cost [8], nuclear will lower in cost because of advancing technology [9]. So basically, coal has a lot of problems, while nuclear power is safe, economical, and good for our country. Thank you and I look forward to a response. [1]: http://leahy.senate.gov...

Sbc6467-Aaf8c3fed	Solar Electic Power	"Thanks to my opponent for continuing with this debate. I apologize for calling my opponent ""Con"" in the last round. He is ""Pro"" of course. I tend to screw that up. Our debate has turned from the nice clean topic of how many solar panels are needed to the dirty business of figuring capital costs, maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and taxes. For a coal fired power plant, only about a third of the cost is coal, Two thirds is ""other."" It is characteristic of discussions of green energy that all those other costs are quietly ignored. They are real and cannot be wished away. In the last round, Pro increased the equipment cost to $90,283 to correct for panel deterioration. He agreed with the costs of insurance and taxes. I'll use those numbers. We agreed to use an increase of grid power cost at 4.6% per year; that includes an inflation component. Batteries are a pain Pro referenced a page that lists deep cycle batteries as one type available. The page points out ""In situations where multiple batteries are connected in series, parallel or series/parallel, replacement batteries should be the same size, type and manufacturer (if possible). Age and usage level should be the same as the companion batteries. Do not put a new battery in a pack which is more than 6 months old or has more than 75 cycles. Either replace with all new or use a good used battery."" A single bad battery can trigger replacing them all. At minimum an extra cost to keep spare capacity and having a system in which batteries can be removed. The referenced page says ""Lifespan can also be seriously reduced at higher temperatures - most manufacturers state this as a 50% loss in life for every 15 degrees F over a 77 degree cell temperature."" Also, ""The standard rating for batteries is at room temperature - 25 degrees C (about 77 F). At approximately -22 degrees F (-27 C), battery AH capacity drops to 50%. At freezing, capacity is reduced by 20%."" The batteries are supposed to be sealed, but they produce hydrogen if they are overcharged. There is an elaborate safety protocol for battery charging. http://www.wisconsin.edu... All this means we have to have a well designed rack structure with ventilation for the batteries, and it should be in a space protected from temperature extremes. Doing that will add to the cost. Maintenance Pro argued that maintenance costs should be a little less because a person could hire a neighborhood kid to do the roof work and electrical maintenance. I think that should either be rejected or the insurance premium for liability on an unlicensed kid doing roof and electrical work be added to the maintenance cost. I don't think that insurance for that is available, so I'm sticking with my estimate. Where I live, a visit from a licensed lumber costs $125, even if he does nothing other than arrive. My $50 estimate is conservative. Selling back electricity I think the ground rule for this debate was a system not connected to the power grid. That's the only way to make a clean comparison without figuring all the costs of randomly accepting power into the grid system. Pro's claim to sell power into the grid is a violation of the ground rule and should not be considered. However, if that route is taken, a much more elaborate control system is required to interface the solar power to the grid. Also, much of that work cannot be practically accomplished by a homeowner, because the electrical code requirements are so extensive. There is a substantial cost for building and maintaining the electrical grid system. Pro argues that the grid is already there, so those costs should not count. That's wrong on principle, When you use something you should pay the proportionate costs. A rental car company has all the cars just sitting there, but when you want to use one you must pay the entire burden of capital costs, depreciation, taxes, and maintenance. Pro offered no evidence that power companies want to deal with the fluctuating inputs of excess solar power. They are required by the government to take the power as a subsidy. It's also not true that a smart grid is already in place. There are so few homeowners feeding power into the grid that they effects are negligible. Having many homeowners doing it would require a massive redesign. Neighborhood utility Pro says that he could come up with a system that sells electricity to his neighbors. That is establishing a new electric utility, subject to the state laws that govern electric utilities. The power company can refuse to connect to you and your neighbors, so you will have to provide your own primary generating capacity. If you do that with solar, no one will need the excess power, because you will all have the excess at the same time. You will need to buy a gas turbine that can be decreased in output when excess solar power is available. The costs of siting, capital, taxes and insurance for that must be figured. You must also wire your own local grid. Home values Pro claims that home renovations that save energy add value to a home. Renovations that save energy include adding insulation, converting to double paned glass, upgrading to appliances, The reference says the house value increases $10 to $25 for every $1 reduction in annual fuel bills. The solar electric system produces little or no reduction in annual fuel bills because the tax, insurance, and maintenance expenses alone are about equal to what the electric bill would have been. The system itself adds some value to the house, the most at the start and depreciating to zero, but there is no gain from paying the upkeep costs rather to the electric bill. Grid purchase of electric starts at $1404 and solar upkeep at $1458. After some time the power gets to be a little more expensive than the maintenance. What is the value of an asset whose main function is to convert utility bills to upkeep bills? I think it is worth nothing. What the system is actually worth over time will not affect your real estate tax. The government uses your building permit to evaluate the cost of the improvement and increase your taxes accordingly. Do-it-yourself Pro is carrying along a hypothetical do-it-yourself free-labor alternative. Many wonderful savings can be achieved with competent free labor. Auto, plumbing, and appliance repairs all become free, for example. My question is what is our homeowner doing that enabled him to save up a minimum of $44K in free cash for the purchased equipment? If the answer is that he cannot save up the cash, then we should add the interest charges for borrowing the money, at something close to credit card rates. If the answer is that his income is so large as to permit lots of savings, then he is probably better off doing what he does for a living and buying the system. I made this argument in the last round, and Pro did not respond. The bottom line: Home solar is 5x grid power Putting the revised initial solar cost into the spread sheet, if the money were invested rather than put into solar, after 25 years there would be $214,000 in the account, and $59,000 worth of electricity would have been purchased from the power company. Including the cost of capital, the solar electric system cost would ($90K + $214K - $10K)/$59K = 5.0 times the grid cost. If you buy the idea of free labor for installation and accept Pro's very low battery costs, the account balance for the grid alternative drops to $97,000. Solar is then ($44K + $97K - $10k)/$59K = 2.2 times the grid cost. However, if the ""free"" labor were hired out and the money invested, the advantage of the grid would be back to 5x. Now, if can keep Pro and Con straight, the resolution is negated. The grid is much cheaper."	CON	372
Sbc6467-A4b87b498	Solar Electic Power	This is a challenge based off of discussion between Roy and myself. The complete resolution: Solar electric power can currently provide energy to the average American home owner at equal or lower cost than the current US grid rate. Solar electric power - Any power source derived directly from solar radiation (as opposed to coal, oil, wood, etc which come from organic material that got energy from solar). Since both Roy and I understand that the effectiveness of solar greatly depends upon the amount of light a house gets over the year, and this light can vary from an average of 8+ hours a day to as low as 2 hours a day pending location in the US, we've both agreed to use Lexington KY to do our solar power calculations on. Standard rules apply, no new arguments final rounds, no insults, and all that jazz, voters can use their reasoning to determine if something steps too far. The first round is for acceptance, however, if my opponent wishes, he may start his arguments in the first round, or pass and I will begin R2. Regardless of what he decides, this should not affect voters regarding conduct or anything. The heart of this debate is to focus on the costs of using solar energy as a power source for your home (we will be looking at individual home scales, not massive city scale projects). We are also DISMISSING governmental subsidies on all fronts (be they state, local, or federal), this is to be based upon the actual cost. I'm not uber good at crafting perfect resolutions, so I hope that by expressing what the heart of the debate is, we can avoid any semantics, though with this particular opponent, I don't see that becoming an issue anyway.

Sbc6467-Af5d1ba6c	Solar Electic Power	I would like to thank my opponent for his round. Before I dive into the costs of my system, and what you will have after 25 years left in the bank. There are some things to point out first. 1) My opponent and I came up with the exact same number for the benefit of investing, so that number is essentially solid and I image that we won't need to waste any characters on it. 2) Deep cycle batteries are designed to be able to discharge between 50% and 80% without damaging them [1]. While they have the most efficient life spans when only discharged 50%, that more efficient life charge is why the company advertises them with a 12 year life span and the warranty does only 7 years, so long as the battery is used correctly. A discharge of 80% would fall under correct usage. It should also be noted that I picked a battery system that would only be going over 50% a handful of times a year, and not every night, so this effect is going to be minimal regardless. 3) My opponent is correct that the solar panels are warranted to be at 80% in 25 years. Earlier, he stated that they deteriorate at a rate of 0.5% to 1%, with a middle ground of 0.75%. As such, I will be expanding the solar panels from 86 to 100 (this will raise the cost from $78,866.60 to $90,283.12, and the laborless cost up to $44,283.12). This will put the 25 year amount for the alternative option at $156,279.90 (and $29,928.13 if you do the labor yourself). 4) Removal of snow and dust from the solar panels does not require a professional under any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that kids (the same that are willing to mow your lawn, clean your gutters, etc) would be willing to work at lower rates for that. However, I also believe that $30 per visit is a decent middle ground (coming to $240 per year). This would put the cleaning at $434.09 at year 25, with an average of $327.91 per year. 5) Inflation will factor into: Cleaning costs, property taxes, insurance taxes, value difference of property. 6) Inflation will not factor into: Electricity costs and capital gains from investments. 7) Energy should be able to be sold back into the grid at whole sale cost for a variety of reasons. First, the energy companies actually do want it (though they would prefer it be free for them) since they are getting energy at 60% discount and don't have to make the capital investment for it. This energy is turned around and sold to others at retail value for profit. Second, we are working with the current grid system and it is already set up for this, so the cost of the smart grid is already a sunken cost. If needed, we could argue that the home owner could pay for additional inverters to sell power to his neighbors at some rate between wholesale and retail (where they are not obligated to be 100% off grid and can work both), this however, gets a lot into sales and negotiating prices and just gets to be too many variables. Benefits of my system I will now go into the costs and benefits of my selected system (still comparing to both). Most of what my opponent shows are true costs and I cannot argue against them. We have insurance and property taxes (I grouped together) at $14.10 per $1,000 of home value. For this we only need to look at how the home value changes because of this system. This is where my opponent makes his biggest miscalculation. The amount of money you put into a home renovation does not equal the amount that it changes the value of your home. Anyone that has decided to renovate a living room or bedroom before moving has learned that just because you put $10,000 into the upgrade, does not mean that you will get that back out (you could get more or less, with living rooms and bedrooms, likely a lot less). Green energy options are very similar in that the dollars you put in are not equal to the dollars you get out. For this, we need to look at how energy savers and energy producing things affect home value (this will also need to be adjusted for inflation). Energy savers actually change your home value not based on how much energy they save (makes sense). Current studies estimate that for every $1 you save on annual energy, your home will increase $10 to $25 [2], this variance likely effected by how pleasing the energy savers are to the eye and such. The middle point will be $17.50, but I'll go with a low ball side and suggest $15.00 for every $1 in energy savings. If we look at the initial investment, it saves the total of $1,403.54 in energy, as well as makes another $1,115.54 in energy sold back to the grid (if my opponent rejects the grid, I can come up with a system that sells to neighbors at 20% under market value, since most people wouldn't mind getting some of their electricity from a neighbor at 20% discount, though that will limit our number of rounds of debating). This comes to a total of $2,519.08, which would increase the value of your home by $37,786.23. This seems like it makes for a very poor investment (only increases the value of the home by 40%), however, we must take into account the fact that energy costs are increasing. And so the value of these savings increases the home's value more and more. After 5 years, the panels are producing $3,076.71 in energy (this takes into account that their efficiency has dropped about 3.7% over these 5 years). This means the increase home value is going to be $52,215.27 (at this point we've had 13.14% inflation). Since energy costs are increasing faster than the solar panels' efficiency is decreasing, the net result is a constant increase in value. We can even see that after 20 years (when the panels are down 14% efficiency, but electricity is up 145.83% in cost), that the panels are generating $5,616.41 worth of electricity and adding up $138,047.20 of value to your house (thanks to 63.86% inflation in 20 years). At 21 years, your house has increased by $147,306.40. Over this same 21 years, you'll have put $11,437.26 in the bank from the selling of electricity back to the grid at wholesale. This takes into account the expenses of maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and the revenue of taking the profit and investing it at the rate of 4.3% (why shouldn't it be invested?). So, we find at the 21 year mark, your initial $90,283.12 solar investment (with labor, $44,283.12 without labor) is now worth $158,743.60, while if you just invested in the markets, you'd be at $148,147.40 (or $36,787.68 for the doing labor for yourself). This shows that at 21 years, you've surpassed the alternative investment. Now, if my opponent wishes to argue that we need to go with $50 per maintenance visit, that only pushes back the crossing point by 1 year. What we find, is that if you pay for the labor, the tipping point occurs at 20 years (if you do the labor yourself, that tipping point is only at 3 years). As you can see the labor costs make a HUGE difference, and my opponent actually suggested that labor would be less, and I'm sure, with enough shopping around, you could find less, and as more people do this, the labor costs will drop, but that only changes where the tipping point is, but in all cases where labor is factored, it will be around the 15 – 22 year mark, and in all cases, where you do it yourself, you'll be at around 2 – 4 years. Based on this, it should be quite clear that placing panels on your home (be they on your roof, on in your yard, if big enough) can be a worthwhile investment for many homeowners. Especially those that are capable of doing the labor, or part of it themselves. Of course, we'll also find that location plays a major role, as well as climate. Is it possible that the various factors line up so that solar is not right for some people? Of course, but for the average homeowner, these will line up in their favor. [1] http://www.windsun.com...

Sb4dd79ae-Ae2ebfe26	Nuclear Energy	I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate and look forward to a wonder debate on the merits of Nuclear Energy. This is going to be a very broad debate, and so it is likely that we will be using all of our characters before saying all that we wish to say. So in order to maximize what we say in our limited space, I will try to keep this as organized as possible. My argument is going to break down into three separate categories. Effectiveness, Safety, and Cost. 1)Effectiveness of Nuclear Energy Nuclear reactors generate electricity though good ol' fashion steam driven generators (the two most common reactors are the PWR [1] and the BWR [2]). The only thing that the nuclear material is used for is heating up the water and turning it into steam. This may sound like old technology (steam locomotives are a thing of old cowboy movies, not modern society), but with modern technology, it is quite capable of generating immense amounts of usable energy with very little input. Since the water that is turned to steam can be cooled and condensed, the water can be reused, and so never needs to be replaced. This means that the only thing that needs to be replaced is the nuclear fuel and parts through general wear and tear (usually the generator, since it has the most moving parts). The nuclear fuel can last about 2 years before needing to be replaced in modern power plants [3]. However, new designs, such as the TWR [4] are designed so that they can go decades between refueling and can even use fuel that was once viewed as waste (only using a small amount of U235, and a vast majority of U238). Your average nuclear reactor produces around 1,000 MW of power, and many power plants will have several reactors on site. The average American home uses 920 kWh per month [5]. This means that a single nuclear reactor (at 1,000 MW) can provide power for about 800,000 homes (exact number is 794,021.7). 2)Safety of nuclear energy and its waste Everyone knows that nuclear material can be dangerous to your health if you are directly exposed to it. This is why nuclear power plants go to crazy lengths to protect people for as much risk as they can. In PWRs, along with many computerized safety systems, the nuclear material is removed from the environment by two layers of the functioning reactor. While in the BWR, the water that the reactor is in is only removed by one layer. Emerging styles, like the PBMR [6] that use silicon carbide for friction protection, are essentially meltdown proof, as should the reactor lose power, the natural flow of the gases in the reactor would prevent a meltdown. When it comes to the waste, reprocessing can eliminate around 80% of it, though it isn't a flat 80% that is being removed. It is basically digging through the waste and gathering the remaining U238 and the Pu239 that forms and is not fissiled away. Originally, we only reprocessed to gather the Pu239 in order to make bombs (shame on us and Russia… and everyone else that copied us afterwards), but that Pu239 can be used as fuel. What aren't reused in the waste are all the Cs, Rb, I, and other fissile products. While those are still dangerous and need to be handled with care, the biggest bad boy in the waste is actually the Pu239 (partially because it will turn to the super evil Radon gas). The rest is bad, but not nearly close to Pu. This means that by reprocessing it, it actually makes less waste, and makes it safer for the whole family (not recommended for children under 10, the elderly, pregnant women, or human skin in general). We also have a wonderful option in new technologies that are developing such as nuclear decay reactors (NDR) [8], which allow us to take radioactive waste, place it in a modified reactor and simply turn the heat that comes off of it into electricity. The other option is to take the waste away and bury it. Now, if the waste is reprocessed, all the Pu239, U238, and any U235 still in it, are removed. So all we have left is the fissile product. The most common of which is Cs133, I135, Zr93 and Mo99, but there are many different elements, all of which have a different half life. For U235 thermal nuclear reaction, 72.24% of the fissile product has a half-life of less than 100 years while only 27.76% is over 1,000 years (surprisingly none of it is between 100 and 1,000 years) [9]. So most of this stuff will naturally decay away into safe and stable elements (many in weeks), while only a little actually remains for thousands ofyears. 3)Cost of building and Maintaining Nuclear Power. Currently (as of 2010), the cost of nuclear fuel for a single reload was $40 million [10]. Now, that may sound like a lot of money. But given that it only needs to be reloaded once every 18 months makes it very cheap indeed (about 0.65 cents per kWh). And with TWR which can use all of the U238, and not just a portion of enriched Uranium, their cost would be lower. In 2010, the average cost of operation and maintenance for a US reactor came in at about 1.49 cents per kWh. And that is with all of the government regulations (some of which are needed, but some of which are not). There are some other costs (like the Nuclear Waste Fund and such), but they come in at around 0.1 cents per kWh. This makes the fuel for nuclear power much cheaper than conventional gas or coal. The downside, is that nuclear power plants are more expensive to construct. Currently around $4,500 per kW, compared to Coal's $3,400 per kW or Natural Gas's $1,000 per kW [11]. With this being said, I will turn the floor over to my opponent. Thank you [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://www-formal.stanford.edu...

S4c598a77-A76d5bee3	Nuclear power is a good idea	"I would like to thank my opponent for starting this debate and look forward to debating someone from my own area. 1) I would like to address the mentioning of Chernobyl, even though it is out of order, because it is the most misunderstood argument that is used against nuclear power. ""The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel."" [1] We also need to note that Chernobyl was a steam explosion, not a nuclear explosion. And was caused by a combination of very poor decisions, from the lacking of basic safety, even for that era, to poor training, to management personnel that was more interested in not looking bad then real issues. The safety issues that happened at Chernobyl were already impossible in the US because of the mechanical safety features we had back in the 80's and our safety has only gotten better. 2) ""There is no way to permanently and securely store nuclear waste."" I have to disagree with this on two points, first, we don't have to ""store"" it. The most common nuclear material is U-235 (Uranium) and it is found naturally across the planet. [2] If we have to be completely safe, it is possible to de-rich uranium (though it is more costly then storing it is depleted and takes up much more space) so that it can be put back in the ground just as it came out, as safe to nature as it has always been. But even without going through that much effort, the storage of fuel is actually extremely safe. The Science behind the yucca mountain shows that it is a safe storage [3], and actually the main fear is that water will corrode the containers if it rains too heavily over enough decades. However, it is possible to upkeep the containers (since we upkeep all our roads and buildings and everything else from corrosion), and we can even design the containers to be extremely immune to corrosion [4] so that the life span goes from decades to centuries to possible millennia. Nuclear power plants also don't produce that much waste, about 20 tons a year per plant. [5] That's the same amount of waste (by weight, not volume) as about 25 people, per year. [6] So when we stop and think about it, it really isn't that much. Going back to safety. Nuclear waste containers have some of the best safety features of any engineered structure. [7] And to show the kind of tests these have to go through. [8] They test those buggers for everything! We have PBRs (Pebble Bed Reactors) that add a whole new level on safety. [9][10] A PBR is ""a reactor whose safety is a matter of physics, not operator skill or reinforced concrete."" We also have Fusion reactors which are starting to pick up steam (couldn't resist the old energy pun from the steam power days). And they too have their safety built in the laws of physics [11] in that if something happens that jeopardizes the power plant, the nuclear reaction will come to a stop on its own, rather then snowball out of control. That is a simple look at the science of the safety, now lets look at the history of the safety, since this is the only aspect where nuclear power have blemishes, since certain nations choose to let their safety slide, they have become bad marks on the entire nuclear concept. But in the USA, not a single human being has EVER died from an incident related to a nuclear power plant or its waste. [12] The most famous incident in US history is the TMI incident, which actually should have been a beacon of hope and success. A most basic back story, in 1979, the TMI nuclear power plant had to be evacuated because a partial meltdown began to happen. The wonderful part about what really happened was that the plant managed to cool itself down on it's own. The built in mechanical safety features protected it from anything really bad from happening. While just over the vent stack, readings up to 1,200 millirems were recorded (indicating that radioactive material was making it out into the environment. The government maintained a registry for 18 years of the 30,000 people that lived in the vicinity and found that they did not experience ANY health fallout (no increased rate of cancer, no increased rate of birth defects, no increased rate of brain issues). [13][14][15] Research has shown that nuclear workers will, on average, be subjected to about 1,000 millirem per year (compared to the average individual who gets about 360 per year), and that will, on average, lessen the workers life by about 50 days, compared to being 15 pounds overweight (lessens your life by about 2 years) or smoking a pack a day (6 years).[12] It is also only fair to compare this energy source to other ones, such as coal or oil. Those industries can only wish for the environmental and safety history of US nuclear power plants.

S27d3ce0b-Afda82663	nuclear power is a reasonable approach to generating electricity	I believe nuclear energy is not a reasonable approach to generating electlicity compared with other forms of power generating methods currentry in use in the world today. We must keep in mind that nuclear energy has a number of disadsvantages as a reasonable energy source. Firstly, nuclear energy brings about more dangerous effects not only on the environment but on the life of human beings than fossil energies like oil and coal. For example, some of the car industries of the world are introducing environment-friendly vehicle like an electlic car these days. This contributes to reducing the emission of carbon dioxide drastically. This means that one of the disadvantages of fossil energies are being coped with by new technologies year by year. However, we can not find these developments in the field of nuclear energy. For example, we must pay attention to the waste called radioactive produced from nuclear power plants. ``The waste remains radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. This is the biggest problem with nuclear energy.``(http://voices.yahoo.com...) Unfortunately, a safe way to deal with the disposal of nuclear waste is not found and developed. Therefore, disposal is a serious problem. And if there is an earthquake, a large amount of radioactive waste which have been stored will be leaked. ( http://voices.yahoo.com...) We must recognize that ``the effects of routine releases of radioactivity from nuclear plants depend somewhat on how the spent fuel is handled. A typical estimate is that they may reduce our life expectancy by 15minutes.``(http://physics.isu.edu....) Secondly, we can point out the risks of nuclear power plants. First risk is that people living near nuclear power plants have a risk of suffering from cancer ``due to long term exposure to low levels of radiation released from nuclear power plants.``(http://voices.yahoo.com...). Second risk is that there is a possibility of attacking on nuclear power plants by terrorist groups.(http://voices.yahoo.com...). The important thing is that ``nuclear power plant accidents can not be avoided 100 percent.``(http://voices.yahoo.com...). Thirdly, the construction of new nuclear power plant needs much time and a lot of money. ``Plants must invest heavily in containment systems and emergency plans. Extensive backup systems must be built and contingency plans must be developed to handle the rare threat of core meltdown.``(http://www.ehow.com...). Finally, in the developed countries many people are protesting against the building of nuclear power plants because of the danger and many risks which they produce. For example, ``there has not been a new nuclear facility in the United States of America since the much-publicized Three Mile Island incident. Furthermore, there are more than 40 special interest groups in the country that have been formed in protest and counter of the nuclear power industry.``(http://www.ehow.com...). As I have argued so far, nuclear energy brings about many detrimental effects not only to society but to the health of human beings. Therefore, nuclear power is not a reasonable approach to generating electricity. Rebuttals are moved for Round 3.	CON	379

Sa6b760ce-Ac3cb2afc	Nuclear power.	Unfortunately, my opponent accidentally forfeited his final round. Yes, there's still Round 4, but TBR and I agreed before the debate that he'd pass in Round 4, since he started the debate off in Round 1. TBR cannot make new arguments in Round 4 because I'd have no way to rebut them, which would make the debate unfair. Still, out of respect for my opponent, voters should read what TBR did write and consider that when weighing the debate. That said, I'm briefly summarize my arguments and explain why I think I win the debate. I made five key arguments: (1) nuclear power isn't economically sound, (2) nuclear power isn't a solution to climate change, (3) nuclear power is vulnerable to terrorism, (4) nuclear power is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and (5) nuclear power is insanely dangerous. TBR did not address most of these arguments (I'm sure he intended to in Round 4, but he accidentally forfeited, so there's nothing that can be done about that). I think I win the debate on the economics issue. TBR did not address that issue, and it's the main reason renewables should be preferred to nuclear. The economics for nuclear simply don't work, because the costs of building plants, mining uranium, storing waste, and then decomissioning plants, on top of the costs of running the plants and producing the electricity, are simply so astronomical that no private investor would ever invest in nuclear. There's also the insurance problem (governments have to insure nuclear since no one else will). The result is that taxpayers end up paying the cost of nuclear, instead of private investors. Renewables are much cheaper, both in the short-term and long-term, which makes them a better solution to our looming energy crisis. Renewables are also better for the environment, they're not vulnerable to the effects of terrorism, and they're safer than nuclear. For all these reasons, and all the reasons discussed throughout the debate, Vote Con. Thank you.	CON	381

S412c152b-A9c8dc791	Carbon capture and sequestration raises costs and energy prices	The reasons that CCS is expected to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing CO2 significantly raise the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition there is added investment or capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant and about 15% for a gas-fired plant. The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30-60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology, the total additional costs of an early large scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1bn per project over the project lifetime.

Scb08147e-Ab89c3230	"the proper versus current approach to ""alternative fuels"""	"Hydrogen, as we currently use and create is not a fuel at all, it's a glorified battery. Hydrogen is exactly as green as the power grid, and less efficient. The way we produce hydrogen is by electrolysis of water. We tear water apart and get the H2 out of the H2O. Which is then used to power cars or other vehicles, either by direct burning or by a fuel cell. In either case, you're still talking about making hydrogen via electrolysis of water. That takes energy to do and it's that energy which is ultimately used to power cars. If we had hydrogen floating around for free we'd use it to power turbines and make electricity out of it. We don't. We have to make hydrogen and do a poor job at it. When you say ""and a fuel (hydrogen)"" -- you're being extremely disingenuous and moreover just plain wrong. Hydrogen isn't a fuel the way we do hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen is messy. It is the tiniest molecule (it's diatomic ergo molecule) there is, and thus leaks out of pretty much everything like a sieve. We have no infrastructure for the creation of hydrogen. We have no infrastructure for the transportation of hydrogen. We have no infrastructure for the distribution of hydrogen. We have no infrastructure for the use of hydrogen. We have no infrastructure for dealing with accidents resulting in hydrogen leaks. We have no infrastructures for dealing with accidents involving hydrogen cars. We don't even have the flipping cars! We have nothing towards this solution, which isn't even a solution at all! Hydrogen isn't carbon free, hydrogen is simply using power from the power grid to split water and use the hydrogen as a fuel. However, you put more energy into that equation than you're ever going to get out again (2nd law of thermodynamics). Currently, most of that energy comes from coal! --- Now you might ask, if not this then what? What will the future look like? Later this year, with all of the needed infrastructure intact, we are going to get the first line of manufacturer-created (there were earlier mods) plug-in hybrids. Using a gas-electric system with a large battery bank it allows people to plug their cars in at home or work to power them with enough range to travel around 50 miles before switching to the gas system. That's well more than the vast majority of people's driving. Many people could easily go months without needing another tank of gas. Electricity from the grid (directly) costs about a dollar a gallon (in comparative terms). We have the gasoline infrastructure. We have the electric infrastructure. We have the cars. There are standard hybrids on the road and getting in accidents today and we are developing mechanisms for dealing with them accordingly. There has been massive and continual advances in battery technology so as the technology gradually improves (we don't have to replace all the cars overnight). We're going to cut down the charge time as well as increase the travel range in incremental steps. As gas prices go higher, the lure of Plug-In Hybrids will become stronger. The need to innovate the technology will become stronger. Further, we don't need some massive revamping of the entire infrastructure to switch over to a entirely new fuel. Further, though corn-based ethanol is a disaster, sugarcane-ethanol is not and improving the gas engines to accept flex-fuel mixes allows those countries with successful ethanol programs to use the same cars. If, by some miracle, our ethanol programs become less of a joke we could still use them in the newer cars. Further you could add solar panels to the car (really a pittance in addition). Due to the smaller size of the engine allow multiple fuels. Further if the technology advances far enough the gas component could drop away completely. --- Your solution is not a solution at all. You're inefficiently distributing energy from the power grid, in leaky form without any underlying infrastructure. I am proposing a solution already progressing in that direction. With a large influx of plug-in hybrids we will reduce our dependence on oil. Then we are down to the task of replacing our grid based brown energy with green (a task we are already slated with)."

Nuclear energy does not help the climate 2. Nuclear energy harms the environment 3. Nuclear Energy efficiency 4. Nuclear energy economically. Contention One: Nuclear Energy does not help the climate ~Looking towards Japan's nuclear plant capacity from 1965 to 1995 Japan's capacity went up from zero to over 40,000 MW. During the same period Carbon Dioxide emissions went up from about 400 million tons to about 1200 million tons. ~Major studies conducted by MIT and the IAEA state that if nuclear power is to play a meaningful role in addressing climate and reducing carbon emissions. We would need to Triple the number of reactors in the US [currently 104], and at least quadruple the number of reactors across the world [currently 440], all by the year 2050. Even with this astronomical increase, you would only reduce carbon emissions by about 20%. And logistically speaking, the nuclear industry is capable of building only 12 reactors per year worldwide. Contention Two: Nuclear energy harms the environment Sub point A: Nuclear Waste and Radioactivity ~Dr. Mark Winfield, who examines Nuclear Energy, finds that an estimated 90 - 100,000 tons of waste can be attributed to uranium production for domestic energy purposes. ~As long lived decay products such as Thorium-230 and Radium-226 are not removed, they are turned to sludge which contains 85% of the initial radioactivity of the ore. In addition, the sludge contains heavy metals and other contaminants such as arsenic, and chemical reagents used during the milling process. ~Furthermore, although the Yucca Mountain repository, as proposed, can house as much as 122,000 tons of waste, congress has mandates that it be limited to 77,000 tons. There are already about 64,000 tons of used reactor fuel at commercial plants in 33 states waiting to be shipped to Nevada. Sub Point B: Air Pollution ~As found by with Helen Caldicott, Nuclear reactors consistently release millions of radioactive isotopes into the air and water each year. These releases are unregulated because the nuclear industry considers these particular radioactive elements to be biologically inconsequential. This is not so. These unregulated isotopes include the noble gases krypton, xenon, and argon, which are fat-soluble, and if inhaled by persons living near a nuclear reactor, are absorbed through the lungs, it then migrates to the fatty tissues of the body. These radioactive elements which emit high energy gamma radiation can mutate the genes in the eggs and sperm and cause genetic disease. Sub Point C: Water ~The State of New York estimates that the Indian point reactors cause the mortality of more than one billion fish a year. ~In the case of the Oyster Creek Reactor in Tim's River New Jersey, the State Department of Environmental protection estimates that the cooling system kills millions of fish, shrimp, and other aquatic creatures each year and that dead marine life expelled from cooling systems back into the source stream create a shadow effect blocking sunlight to underwater organisms and limiting oxygen uptake. Contention Three: Nuclear energy efficiency ~Nuclear reactors require a steady flow of cool water in order to operate. In recent years, elevated temperatures in rivers and ocean water have caused nuclear power reactors to be taken off-line. Hot water not only may violate the technical specifications for reactor core cooling, hot water does not cool the reactor condenser, which simply means, the device does not work ~The short comings of nuclear power reliability were also evident in July 2006 when, in Sweden back up generators malfunctioned during a power outage, forcing shutdown of the reactors at forsmark. Plant workers reported to Swedish media that it had come close to a meltdown. Following the incident, Swedish officials shut down half of Sweden's ten nuclear plants triggering record price increases Contention Four: Nuclear Energy has negative economic ramifications ~According to the Center for American Progress, Nuclear power plant construction costs, materials labor and engineering rose by 185 percent between 2006 and 2007 More recently costs have been increasing even faster, American Electric Power Company CEO Michael Morris states ""I'm not convinced we'll see a new nuclear station before the 2020 timeline, citing realistic costs of about 4,000 dollars per kilowatt. Since then, the prices utilities are quoting for nuclear have soared 50-100 %."	CON	402

Sf1a21db5-Ae83b83c7	Resolved: The USFG should substantially increase alternative energy incentives in the US.	"For my first argument I would like to point out that my opponent has completely ignored a huge portion of my arguments by calling them irrelevant, when they were in fact totally relevant. The arguments he say pertain only to nuclear energy actually pertain to the water that deuterium comes from, which is used in both fission and fusion. Since we are doing a policy debate my opponent cannot add new arguments from this point on, (no new arguments in rebuttals) therefore I have won all of those points which he ignored. My opponents evidence states that fusion COULD be achieved within the next century, by which point it will likely be pointless, we need to solve this problem and we need to solve it now, waiting for 2100 won't work, and even then we cant be sure we will get nuclear fusion. My opponent has still not shown any factual evidence that there will be no environmental effects of nuclear fusion, but has relied on biased evidence which only states that there will be no pollution from combustion, which is obvious since combustion doesn't occur during nuclear fusion in the sense they are referring to. He has also failed to ensure that the program will have no other agendas, I cannot be sure what these agendas would be, but without enforcement the program could do anything they please with the funding. Since the PRO has stated that the group will have no agendas I would like to press for evidence and remind him that you can, at any time be asked for evidence backing something you said. Onto my argument from fas.org, I doubt you looked over that whole sight but I am sorry I didn't realise I didn't link you to the exact article, here it is. http://www.fas.org... This is in reference to the production of deuterium which you have said is so easy to come by, and the fact that you would need to boil lots of water to get the deuterium shows that you would need some form of energy to get it, just so you can make more energy. The argument about the tainted water refers to water from a plant which made deuterium proving that bad things can come of this. Again, the water refers to the production of deuterium, directly linking it to your plan. I believe I have shown that there are hidden environmental effects which would occur if we somehow achieved fusion, and that it is unlikely that we will, also that my opponent's form of research is flawed and could potentially cost the government a large amount of money since my opponent didn't put a cap on the emergency fund, also that my opponent has failed to prove any of these points to be wrong. When judging this debate the judges must ask themselves ""Do the large amounts of risks outweigh the slim chance of success, and even slimmer chance that fusion will live up to what it claims to be?"". I stand firm on my arguments and again press for the same evidence as last time, I would also like to remind the judges of several things they may be unaware of about policy debate. 1- Ignoring a press for evidence is not acceptable."

Batteries My opponent reminded everyone that batteries are not recommended to mix old with new. This is not really a problem since I already calculated in replacing the entire battery system every 9 years (3 years shy of their estimated life span). My opponent also says that the batteries can't be sealed because of the dangers of overcharging them. This is not really an issue because the inverter that I picked in round 2 is specifically designed to go between direct use of energy, to charging batteries, to selling to the grid. This means that when the batteries are full, the system automatically switches for safety. Maintenance My opponent says that there would be extra costs for electrical work. That is true, but that is not what we are arguing with this point. To go back to my opponent's first round, he says, ""Solar electric systems require cleaning dirt off the panels twice a year, plus snow removal as often as it snows."" Removal of snow and cleaning of dirt is not electrical work. It does not take a certified person to do it. While we can argue that electrical maintenance needs to be done every now and again, it does not need to be done every 2 months. How often does the average home owner bring in an electrician to check the wiring throughout their house? Not every other month, not even every year. Many don't do anything until they are actually selling their home, or a problem arises. However, I factored in both my estimates and my opponent's estimates for maintenance (as seen in the spread sheet) and it only alters the tipping point by 1 year, not enough to swing the entire equation. So it doesn't really matter. Selling back electricity This is a major part of this debate. Going over the opening rounds, and our PMs back and forth before starting, we never said anything about being completely off-grid. Stating the solar must be 100% off-grid or nothing at all would be presenting a false dichotomy. The panels I selected are designed specifically to grid tie-ins, and the inverter that I selected (all back in R2) is designed to tie back into the grid, these were all accepted. Since these are all products designed for power generation and commercially available, there should be no reason at all why they cannot be utilized to maximize the efficiency of the system. My opponent even said, ""My opponent [Ore_Ele] may chose design variations to optimize costs."" If we dismiss the real world option of tying back into the grid, all my opponent will do is prove that 100% independent solar is not cost effective, rather than that solar altogether is not cost effective. Ruining the purpose of the debate. Remember, ""The heart of this debate is to focus on the costs of using solar energy as a power source for your home."" From R1. The government only requires companies to offer net metering. This means that if you produce your own energy, they can't double charge you. This also means that if the energy company uses your generated electricity, they have to pay you for it, i.e. buy it from you. Why should they use it and not pay for it? Home value The value of the electricity that you don't have to buy is $1,403.54 (increases 4.6% every year). And the money you make by selling electricity back to the grid is $1,115.54 (increases 4.6% every year). So the total energy difference is $2,519.08 for the first year (reminding again, this increases 4.6% every year). The costs for the maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc ranges from $742.79 to $882.79 that first year, pending if you accept Roy's maintenance costs or mine. This means that it is still highly in your favor. My opponent says, ""The government uses your building permit to evaluate the cost of the improvement and increase your taxes accordingly."" This is not true. Property taxes are based on your assessed value, which is based on estimated market value [2]. It does not matter how much you put into the upgrade. If we stop and look at two examples, we can see how this is logically true. If you spend $20,000 replacing all the tiles in your bathrooms and kitchen with glow in the dark tiles, that is not going to raise your property value by $20,000, it would probably even lower it. Likewise, with this case, one might think that the very existence of the solar panels would increase value because they are an asset that can be sold for money. This isn't accurate, when considering that they are only worth $44,000 and it would take another $46,000 of labor to remove them (meaning they cannot be pulled off and sold very well), so their value would not affect home value at all. The only thing from them that would affect home value is the work that they do (energy generation). Now, we should explain why home value must be counted as an asset on our balance sheet. I could simply say that property values need to be counted under GAAP, however home owners are not obligated to follow GAAP and can do whatever they want (and probably end up going bankrupt if they can't balance a budget). But, like it or not, homes are an asset and are worth money. Surely my opponent would agree that spending $10,000 to increase the value of your home by $50,000 would be considered a smart investment (it allows for more profit at time of sale and builds equity should you need it later). This increase in assets is not something that can be ignored, no more than I can ignore the interest being built up by the alternative method. DIY This was missed last round because of character limits. This is merely to show that they do have DIY kits, and that solar installation is not like rebuilding a semi truck tranny. It doesn't require any complicated tools more than a power drill, a ladder, and (highly recommended) a safety harness. The example of a person that makes so much money is actually a very poor excuse. Your average person is going to be an employee, and set to work a set schedule. As an employee, you are likely paid either hourly or salary (if you make enough to be able to afford this system, you're probably salary). At hourly, you can't just work as many hours as you want, your employer has to approve it. Try going into work two hours early, and stay two hours late and see how long it takes before your boss says you need to only come in for your schedule. With salary, it is different. You can work as many hours as you want (or need to get your job done), and you are paid the same. The only pay rate that would be applicable is commission based, and not many people work that way. The bottom line If you invest the money rather than buy solar, you will get $156,279.87 (a 73.10% profit). If you invest in the solar, you'll get $185,105.50 (a 105.03% profit). We see the solar becomes a better investment on year 22 (when it hits 67.06% to the investment's 64.09%). We can also see that it isn't until year 15 that the solar finally hits a positive percentage. There is a logical reason for this. Solar is not cost effective at 11.09 cents per kWh, however, we know that the cost of energy is only going to up, and as it goes up, solar gets better and better, so while the solar isn't helping too much to start, by the time when years 15 – 20 start to come around (and electricity is going at 20 to 30 cents per kWh, the panels installed are able to make up the lost ground.

S45c09d10-A17eff9ca	government should intervene more with alternative fuel	why the government should intervene more with alternative fuel. people say the market will take care of itself. in the end, it will. but at what cost in the mean time? we should act now because we'll look back and see how much we've wasted on gasoline. companies say they can make alternative biodesial fuels for a dollar a gallon. (using algae farms, or any organic material using bacteria to make ethanol from hte cellulose material, switch grass and other things more entergy intensive than corn etc.. and exemplified by brazil etc who are energy dependant right now from gas) but, there's a catch 22 occuring. comanyies make alternative companies but often must put operations on hold. why? because there's no demand. the consumers who make demand say there's no supply. who can afford as a consumer to buy altnernative vehicles? the richer. does the rising prices right now of gasoline hurt them? not as much so they don't buy. but, even if they bought cars sometimes as they are now, there's still not much there in way of an infrastructure for the supply side. the rich won't start buying more until it really starting hurting them. the poor won't do it cause they can't. the middle won't do it, probaly for the same reason. it's conventional wisdom that the rich are the ones who start these new technologies... and the conventional wisdom is probably true here too. but, unlike many situations with conventinoal wisdom... for altrnernative fuel, waiting till the rich start teh technology isn't in the best interest of the country right now. that's because... for many other things, like buying a DVD player... fuel isn't something that's simply a perk as much, and isn't such a regular and substantial cost for the consumer. it has a noticable affect on the economy. fuel is the opposite. while we're waiting for the rich to convert, what's happening? in the mean time, the poorer are spending their money on gas, or not being as productive as they could with cheaper gas or some gas at all. the middle class largely too. consider all that money they're spending on that, when they could be spending on an array of other things. all that money could have been going to the economy at large, instead of the pockets and costs of a few. (and foreignors, which is a major concern in and of itself) to make it more of a practical example. say a new biodesial machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand. all that money that the poorer are wasting right now would have been more than enough to either subsidize or lend to that station. (you could lend the money to them... and ensur ethey make a tidy profit before they ever have to pay it back, if ever considering there's a risk they might not make money) if we invested in them as a government then, the effects would be much sooner, and the poorer and middle class would save more, and it'd be a boon to the economy. (plus all the jobs involved with the transitioning infrastructure) there'd be so much savings, you could even lend or subsidize biodisal plants too, though it'd probably not be needed for them. government intervention is the way to break the catch 22 sooner when it'll make a difference for hte economy, than later when we'll look back and see all that wealth that has been squandered.

S53275be8-Af1ea187f	Nuclear power is potentially extremely unsafe	"It is unfortunately the case that the nuclear industry has a bad reputation for safety. This is undeserved. The overwhelming majority of nuclear reactors have functioned safely and effectively for their entire lifetimes. The four historic nuclear disasters (1957 Windscale Fire, 1979 Three Mile Island and 1986 Chernobyl, 2011 Fukushima, Japan) killed fewer people than the oil and coal industries have1. ""The multi-agency U.N. Chernobyl Forum reported last year that 56 deaths could be directly attributed to the accident, most of those from radiation or burns suffered while fighting the fire. Tragic as those deaths were, they pale in comparison to the more than 5,000 coal-mining deaths that occur worldwide every year""2. Further, the two major nuclear accidents, at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, were both in old style reactors, made worse in the latter case by poor Soviet safety standards. The Chernobyl disaster took place at a time when our understanding of nuclear issues was much lesser than it is now, and was the result of poorly trained staff in the plant's control room. Power stations today are better staffed, better maintained and better understood, and because the effects of an attack upon them are acknowledged, they are better defended and monitored by the armed services. No system can be 100% safe, but solid design principles can minimize risk. Perhaps the best guarantee of safety standards in the nuclear industry is the increasing transparency with which the industry is presenting itself. Many of the problems in its early days were caused by excessive control due to the origin of nuclear energy from military applications. As the gap between the two separates so the nuclear industry becomes more accountable. The question is, is the slight risk of a nuclear accident a worse danger than the inevitable climate catastrophe that awaits us? 1 'Risks of Nuclear Power' by Bernard Cohen, University of Pittsburgh, 2Patrick Moore, a prominent environmentalist and founding member of Greenpeace, ""Going Nuclear A Green Makes the Case"", Washington Post, 4/16/06"""	PRO	416

Because my opponent has started the debate, stating ""i think tidal power is the best power..."" the burden of proof is on my opponent, but for Round One, I will work with what I have, providing a few arguments of my own and at the same time to rebuke or prove false any of my opponent's statements. First off, this, from my opponent's previous agrument, states ""...becuase it would not harm the envoirment and also it won't hurt the sea life and it prouduces electrity my favorite tidal power is the seagen turbine it powers up to a 1,000 homes and also it can't hurt sea life the 52 feet blades move so slow that sea life can't be harmed and also it moves all the time..."" In his argument, he failed to explain just how these generators don't harm the enviroment, other than ""...blades move so slow"". I did some reasearch, and this came up first. Check it out: ""Fish may move through sluices safely, but when these are closed, fish will seek out turbines and attempt to swim through them. Also, some fish will be unable to escape the water speed near a turbine and will be sucked through. Even with the most fish-friendly turbine design, fish mortality per pass is approximately 15%."" Hmmm... I didn't mean to burst your bubble or anything, so sorry, but next time you should check your sources. I found this too: ""Turbidity Turbidity (the amount of matter in suspension in the water) decreases as a result of smaller volume of water being exchanged between the basin and the sea. This lets light from the Sun to penetrate the water further, improving conditions for the phytoplankton. The changes propagate up the food chain, causing a general change in the ecosystem. Salinity As a result of less water exchange with the sea, the average salinity inside the basin decreases, also affecting the ecosystem... ""Tidal Lagoons"" do not suffer from this problem. Sediment movements Estuaries often have high volume of sediments moving through them, from the rivers to the sea. The introduction of a barrage into an estuary may result in sediment accumulation within the barrage, affecting the ecosystem and also the operation of the barrage."" http://en.wikipedia.org..."

Sbc6467-A7ca4245c	Solar Electic Power	Thanks to Ore_Ele (I believe he is from Krypton) for a superb topic. The reason it is such a good topic is that it is as close to an engineering topic as we are likely to ever see here on DDO, and engineering is more fun than anything else. Well, almost anything else. An engineering topic also means that most readers will be snoring way by the end of R2, but that cannot be helped. For this round, I want to try to establish requirements and categories of costs. I think these will be common to our designs. Grid power cost We need to know how much electricity the average homeowner uses in a year. Homeowners include condo owners in multi-unit buildings. It's doubtful that condo owners will be able to put solar panels on their roof, but the numbers don't seem to change to much by excluding them. The U.S. Energy Information Agency provides a Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) [1. http://www.eia.gov... ].The relevant spreadsheet [2. http://www.eia.gov... says the average home uses 12,656 kWh of electricity. The data appears to have been updated to 2009, the most recent yea available. I'm currently under the impression that electric power consumption is about steady year-to-year. The average residential rate for grid power is 11.09 cents per kWh. It's cheaper in Lexington KY, our chosen city, but I'll use the average rate. Our average homeowner uses $1402.55 worth of electricity per year. That's the target for a solar power system to beat. I'm assuming the grid cost includes taxes buried in the total. Solar costs We need the add up the costs for installing a solar electric system and convert them to a yearly basic for comparison. Purchased solar panels. This is the price of the panels divided by the life expectancy. Some panels only last 15 years, but 20 or 25 years is more common. The panels deteriorate by 0.5% to 1% per year so the system must be oversized by 12.5% to 25% to compensate. On cloudy days, the solar output drops in half. To make up for a long string of half-power days there has to be either battery storage or the system must be doubled in size from the nominal calculation. Doubling covers a period of cloudiness of unlimited length, so that seems better. I assume that doubling the size would also accommodate unusual periods of high heat that produce high air conditioning costs. I know it helps that summer days are longer, otherwise the peak would be more severe. It does not suffice to provide enough total energy over a year. The peak loads must also met. On the power grid, peak load costs are met by keeping spare capacity in the system. Inverter and batteries.An inverter system must be provided to convert DC from the panels to AC. The inverter system is sometimes included with batteries to provide peak loads and night operation. Inverter systems are advertised to have a life of ten years. Batteries must be kept half-charged to prevent damage, so the size of the battery system must be double the nameplate rated capacity. [3. http://solarpanel-direct.com... ] Other equipment related costs. In addition to the basic equipment, there are costs for shipping, installation, and sales tax. Maintenance. Solar electric systems require cleaning dirt off the panels twice a year, plus snow removal as often as it snows. Looking at the weather records for Lexington, I'm guess there are about five snow falls per year that require snow removal. There is also some maintenance in inspecting and cleaning battery terminals. [3] The homeowner might do this himself, but we are trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison to the power grid, where maintenance is included in the delivered price. The homeowner also might be unwilling or unable to do roof work. Cost of Capital. This is cost of having money tied up in the solar electric system. One way to think of it is he cost to borrow the money to build the system, but it could also be thought of as the value that would be received by investing the money. If capital costs are not counted, then you can get free electricity forever by just putting money in the bank and using the interest to pay the electric bill. Capital costs must be counted. The question is what interest rate to assume. I think the appropriate interest rate to figure is the rate on twenty year utility bonds. We are financing power here, so that is an interest rate for the money used for building power plants. Homeowners are unlikely to get rates as low as public utilities, but homeowners would also have trouble finding a safe investment with a higher yield. The current yield is 4.3%. [4. http://www.finance-mentor.com...] For every $10,000 spent on a solar installation, the cost of capital is $430 each year. My opponent may chose design variations to optimize costs. For example, one might oversize the installed panel capacity by 10% to compensate for deterioration, and then add 10% panel capacity after ten years. Perhaps there are more clever design alternatives. However the system is designed, all the categories of costs must be accounted for. For the record, I agree that reducing dependence on the power grid is a terrific goal. It would get the government out of the loop, and it saves all the money spent on grid costs. About four of the eleven cents in the cost of grid electricity is spent on the power transmission overhead. But while getting off the grid is a terrific goal, achieving competitive cost is probably twenty years away. We'll see.	CON	466

Scb08147e-A5cf15ff1	"the proper versus current approach to ""alternative fuels"""	"Oh gee once again to debate with a science genius who knows it all Oh well! First of all, if not hydrogen - YOU name a fuel that can replace gasoline in its entirety forever ___________________________ Now to debunk your silly arguments (1) Hydrogen, as we currently use and create is not a fuel at all, it's a glorified battery Wrong. Hydrogen is a fuel, and powers the space shuttle for example. it has NOTHING to do with batteries, which are solid electrochemical storage devices. (2) Hydrogen is exactly as green as the power grid, and less efficient. This is a nonsceintific argument- ""green"" is irrelevant, although hydrogen is by far the most ""green"" according to wacko leftists who think we are all doomed due to CO2 (3) The way we produce hydrogen is by electrolysis of water. We tear water apart and get the H2 out of the H2O. WRONG again. Primarily right now hydrogen is produced through reformation of methane (natural gas) Eventually, electrolysis will be the primary methodology of creating H2 from water, through medium temperature catalysed steam electrolysis Now you just spew some nonsense , which I will not address. Until this statement (4) hydrogen is messy. It is the tiniest molecule (it's diatomic ergo molecule) there is, and thus leaks out of pretty much everything like a sieve. Hydrogen is the CLEANEST of all possible fuels. If I have an airplane FILLED with liquid hydrogen, and I rupture the tank, 100% of the hydrogen will evaporate into space at 7 miles per second. Not a drop will be left on the ground. When hydrogen burns, it makes only water. The fact that it can embrittle certain metals is well known and preventable. the fact that it will escape through holes is a non factor. Now to your stupid diabtribe (5) We have no infrastructure for the creation of hydrogen. yes we do- the natural gas infrastruture. We can mix hyodrogen with natural gas to make hythane as an intermediate We have no infrastructure for the transportation of hydrogen. Yes we do - tankers and the natural gas infrastructure We have no infrastructure for the distribution of hydrogen. Ditto We have no infrastructure for the use of hydrogen. Oh gee, so we cant build it? Germany has an entire infrastructure built already and Mercedes Benz DE is putting out lines of hydrogen powered cars starting in 07 We have no infrastructure for dealing with accidents resulting in hydrogen leaks. Wrong. and hydrogen is MUCH SAFER than gasoline and JP4. you DONT NEED and infrastructure like a hazmat team We have no infrastructures for dealing with accidents involving hydrogen cars. Again, more nonsense We don't even have the flipping cars! Now you resort to hysteria. you typify the typical NON-scientific liberal reaction to hydrogen, Congrats. (6) Hydrogen isn't carbon free, hydrogen is simply using power from the power grid to split water and use the hydrogen as a fuel WRONG. What if I take PV, Wind power, hydroelectric, or geothermal. Nice try or even NUCLEAR power (liberals start foaming at the mouth and running for the hills at even the mention) (7) However, you put more energy into that equation than you're ever going to get out again (2nd law of thermodynamics) Ok genius, well how about Ethanol ? it takes about 2 gallons of diesel to get one gallon of ethanol to the pump- boy thats efficient You can electrolyze water at about 70% efficiency easily. And please, you dont even know what the 1st -3rd laws even say, never mind enthalpy and entropy, so dont try to appear like you do Now YOUR solution - electric cars Now you might ask, if not this then what? What will the future look like? Later this year, with all of the needed infrastructure intact, we are going to get the first line of manufacturer-created (there were earlier mods) plug-in hybrids. Using a gas-electric system with a large battery bank it allows people to plug their cars in at home or work to power them with enough range to travel around 50 miles before switching to the gas system. That's well more than the vast majority of people's driving. Many people could easily go months without needing another tank of gas. Electricity from the grid (directly) costs about a dollar a gallon (in comparative terms) Batteries alone will NOT work. They take 8 hours to recharge, they are heavy, the range is short and without a generator on board the batteries get run down quickly. General motors put out the EV1 more than 10 years ago and it failed. And you ""dollar a gallon"" argument does not hold water. A small car 9ie a prius) uses about 100 kW . that is 100 kWh per hr. a kWh costs about 15 cents here in CA. that is about $ 15 per hour or about 60 miles. that is $ 0.25 per mile Gasoline costs 3$ per gallon. One gallon gets you about 40 miles with a car like a prius. that is $ 3.00 / 40 miles = 7.5 cents per mile and YOU said that "" Currently, most of that energy comes from coal!"" you cant have it both ways the bottom line is that technology IS advancing and batteries continue to improve, but are not going to have quick recharge ever. Ethanol from any source , as well as biofuels or ANYTHING that starts with photosynthesis (1% efficient) , which aslo displaces FOOD from people, is the WRONG PATH. Also you did NOT address AIRPLANES and TRUCKS and SHIPS, did you? NONE of these will run on batteries, and will need a fuel HYDROGEN , with the highest energy density, can power all of them HYDROGEN is LIMITLESS HYDROGEN is ULTIMATELY CLEAN HYDROGEN IS THE ANSWER Someday that will get it"	PRO	494
Seaed4f92-Aafec4c73	Nuclear power plants should be torn down forever	I'd to thank MarquisX for stepping up to the challenge as I will try to say why Nuclear power Plants are bad. 1. Nuclear power plants use Uranium as fuel which is scarce and will run out in 50-60 years. Therefore Nuclear power is not a renewable source of energy 2. The problem of radioactive waste is still an unsolved one. The waste from nuclear energy is extremely dangerous and it has to be carefully looked after for several thousand years (10'000 years according to United States Environmental Protection Agency standards). 3.High risks: Despite a generally high security standard, accidents can still happen. It is technically impossible to build a plant with 100% security. A small probability of failure will always last. The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating both for human being as for the nature. 4. A meltdown in one of Russia's power plant had a MASSIVE leak of radiation in Chernobyl. the people there we're quarantined until all of the radiation could be removed. It would take 50 years maybe.

Sa6b760ce-Ac7a5345e	Nuclear power.	"Con has provided some great info about alternative energy. I will address each concern, starting with the most direct and concerning problem with Nuclear energy, danger from waste. It is the ONLY of the concerns that is not external to the technology, and deserves the most attention. IV GODZILLA!!! Well, there we have it. In about 50 years since the first nuclear plants were constructed, nuclear accidents have been the direct caused of roughly 4,000 and 200,000 deaths. There is no reason to not disclose this number, and while outrageous, I am more inclined to take something closer to the Greenpeace number than the low estimate. It may seem comical, but before even talking about the staggering death tolls of coal and other fossil fuels, I think it's fair to see what the impact from the daddy of nuclear reactors is. Annually around 1.5 million DALYs (Disability-adjusted life years) are lost through excessive UV exposure[4.2][4.3]. In the UK alone, more than 2,000 die annually from the effects of the sun. My comparison seems unfair, and it is a little. We can't shut off the sun, and we sure don't want to. What I am illustrating, however, is that there is risk that we understand and accept. We work to mitigate the risk. We no longer go out sunbathing covered in baby oil hoping to look like Zonker Harris's idol - George Hamilton. We use skin protection, wear sun glasses "" as we understand the risk better, we work to mitigate the risk more. This is the overriding message for nuclear. Assess what went wrong, and work to make sure it doesn't happen again. The story is not only about direct deaths per year at the hands of various power generation physicality, right? If that was the only metric, I could just point to the staggering direct death toll of coal, and be done with this. No, assessing the year-over-year death rate is intellectual dishonesty within this debate. It""s dishonest because it doesn""t address Godzilla in any real way, and I promised that I would not skirt that issue. Nope, we are going to have to talk about... Blinky! (don""t get worked up, I am getting to Godzilla! Right, and those fossil fuel death tolls.) Blinky is a three-eyed irradiated fish who, do to vagary of ""place"" of the writers of The Simpsons, could be living in a lake nearby you right now. However, I have looked and looked, and I can""t find blinky. What I can find is the Pacific Bluefin tuna. The Bluefin have made the news as a deadly dangerous ""fallout"" from the Fukushima disaster. In fact, I have seen Blinky morphed into a pacific Bluefin tuna in political cartoons. No one is doubting that the Bluefin population has been effected, but we need to look at the effect in our real world. For example, when a person eats an average 200g serving of Bluefin tuna, they may ingest about 7.7 nanosievert of radiation. That sounds... not so good. However, when a person ingests a typical uncontaminated banana, they are getting 20 times the radiation. I don""t like fish much, so I don""t have much to worry about. My 4 year-old son eats bananas like a monkey, and I don""t freak-out when he is going on his third on a Sunday morning - my son only glows in my eyes. A common notion is that we have about the Godzilla effect (he is coming) is that we are irradiating our land. Our worst nuclear power disaster in total land wasted is by far Chernobyl. Over 63,000 square miles of land have been affected by this disaster[4.6]. It""s always helpful to put numbers like that in some frame. Florida is about 59,000 square miles. That is a good chunk of land effected for a lifetime"" Wait one. Who""s lifetime? Some smart folk are working on growing biofuels on the affected land of Chernobyl. The plan is to use the crops to suck up the radioactive strontium and caesium and make the soil fit to grow food again within decades rather than hundreds of years[4.5]. It""s a good chance that I will have been alive to see the disaster happen, and to see the disaster cleaned-up. And while I really want to get to Godzilla, he isn""t in Japan, and he is not in Russa. Let""s take a look at where we (the US) are stuffing all our waste. According to the Congressional Research Service (using NEI data), there were 62,683 metric tons of commercial spent fuel accumulated in the United States as of the end of 2009. Most of that waste, about 78% is actually stored in pools, 22% is stored in dry casks and we are adding 2,400 tons per year[4.7]. Doing a little math, going for some outside numbers, and average lifespans, what percentage of this junk is mine? Roughly 2 pounds. Two pounds of some really nasty stuff, but still just 2 pounds. Later in the cool new technology section, we get to see fun stuff we can do with my 2 pounds of nasty stuff, but for now let""s deal with it how I would deal with it NOW! Well, I don't really want the stuff. I could bury it in the back yard, truth is, it could be made safeish. I wife wouldn't like it, but none the less, I wouldn't panic for one second, dry casks are incredibly safe[4.7]. I don't panic easy, so I may not be a great example. My wife, well, she would tell me to take that crap as far away as possible! Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Located about 80 miles outside Las Vegas - right next to the Nevada Test Site we had been irradiated for years with nuclear bombs "" is our latest scheme for what is called ""deep geological repository storage facility"" for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste. That sounds positively sinister, at least it does to a good number of people who have wife's like mine who want the stuff as far away from them and their families as possible. Sometimes there is no arguing with people, and if the good folk of Nevada (about 78%) don't want me tossing my 2 pounds worth of radioactive waste material in their barren wasteland, who am I to complain. What then. I have this 2 pound container of crazy waste to deal with, my wife won't let me keep it in the back yard until its worth something, and Nevada is behaving like it's a dam democracy or something. Breathe everyone. Should the voters of Nevada get their way (and I hope they do) we will do the really logical thing. Keep the stuff right where it was made. Not forever, not even for generations. Just till the future, and to understand that future you will have to read the next round. So where is our Godzilla? Godzilla is fiction. Godzilla looks to us like the first picture below. Look just a little closer, and Godzilla is not as frightening as we though when watching the movie. Finally, what we should be looking at is what Godzilla will look like in the near future, like the last photo in the scare chain. Hold one! I didn't get to the deaths from coal! How carless of me. I can tell you about the total weight of CO2, or the mercury, or the direct deaths mining, or that fly ash is more radioactive than nuclear waste (that's right, MORE radioactive), but it's all insignificant. The truth is, coal for power production is killing everyone and everything. The death toll from coal could be EVERYONE! [4.1] http://www.smashinglists.com... [4.2] http://www.who.int...

Scf368ef2-Ab7fe8c2f	ODT: The U.S. should increase its nuclear energy development.	"C1: Nuclear power efficacy [1] We know that nuclear power is efficient and cheap energy, as demonstrated by France, Germany and now even China. France has developed safe nuclear energy to the point of generating 75% of its energy from nuclear power. WNA writes, “France is the world's largest net exporter of electricity due to its very low cost of generation, and gains over EUR 3 billion per year from this…As a result of the 1974 decision, France now claims a substantial level of energy independence and almost the lowest cost electricity in Europe. It also has an extremely low level of CO2 emissions per capita from electricity generation, since over 90% of its electricity is nuclear or hydro.” C2: Nuclear power, transition and the economy [2] As oil supplies decrease and “green energy” prospects glim due to an unfavorable market and economic manipulation on the part of the Chinese the U.S. is in a difficult position to secure energy development and security. An answer to this is nuclear energy. The technology is available, the infrastructure is available, the private and public capital is available, the only thing that needs to get out of the way is government mandates blocking nuclear development. As opposed to oil, nuclear energy can be created and unlike “green energy”, nuclear energy is economically viable. Thus, in order to break oil dependence and in order to transition our economy towards economically viable “green energy” the U.S. should increase its nuclear development. Fertel writes, A single nuclear plant will create 1,400 to 1,800 jobs during construction and 400 to 700 employees during the 60-year operating lifetime of the plant. Based on economic studies of 22 U.S. nuclear power plants, each year a new reactor will produce $430 million in local expenditures for goods, services and labor; generate more than $20 million in state and local tax revenue; and produce at least $75 million in federal tax payments. Construction of a new reactor also will provide a substantial boost to suppliers of commodities and manufacturers of hundreds of components. C3: Nuclear power reduces air pollution [3] [4] CNA writes, Nuclear power reactors emit no carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides or sulphur dioxide. In nuclear power plants the energy to generate the electricity comes from a nuclear reactionentirely within the uranium fuel inside the reactor. Since there is no combustion there areno emissions. The 438 nuclear power reactors operating around the world generate aboutone sixth of our electricity and emit no global warming, smog or acid rain gases. In 2009, Canada's nuclear stations generated about 15% of our electricity. The nuclear power plants in Ontario produced 55% of the electricity used in that province. If the electricity produced by Canada's nuclear power plants were generated by coal, there would be an additional 90 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted into our atmosphere each year. Canada's emissions of nitrous oxides and sulphur dioxide would also increase by about10%, adding to smog and acid rain. And, this prevents unnecessary deaths. NIEHS writes, “Lives saved by research on the health consequences of environmental pollutants can be counted in the millions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimates on air pollution, the commitment to new air quality standards and cleaner air will prevent 23,000 premature American deaths, 1.7 million cases of asthma attack or aggravation of chronic asthma, 67,000 new cases of acute and chronic bronchitis, 22,000 respiratory-related hospital admissions, and 42,000 hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease…” C4: Nuclear power and the War on Terror (CiRrK signature) [5] IAGS writes, ""The line between the barrel and the bomb is clear. It is oil wealth that enables dictatorial regimes to sustain themselves, resisting openness, progress and power sharing. Some semi-feudal royal families in the Gulf buy their legitimacy from the Muslim religious establishment. This establishment uses oil money to globally propagate hostility to the West, modernity, non-Muslims, and women. This trend is likely to continue. Both the International Energy Agency and the Energy Information Agency of the U.S. Department of Energy currently project a steady increase in world demand for oil through at least 2020. This means further enrichment of the oil-producing countries and continued access of terrorist groups to a viable financial network which allow then remain a lethal threat to the U.S. and its allies."" Saudi Arabia “It is no coincidence that so much of the cash filling terrorists' coffers come from the oil monarchies in the Persian Gulf. It is also no coincidence that those countries holding the world's largest oil reserves and those generating most of their income from oil exports, are also those with the strongest support for radical Islam. In fact, oil and terrorism are entangled. If not for the West's oil money, most Gulf states would not have had the wealth that allowed them to invest so much in arms procurement and sponsor terrorists organizations…Most wealthy Saudis who sponsor charities and educational foundations that preach religious intolerance and hate toward the Western values have made their money from the petroleum industry or its subsidiaries. Osama bin Laden's wealth comes from the family's construction company that made its fortune from government contracts financed by oil money. It is also oil money that enables Saudi Arabia to invest approximately 40% of its income on weapons procurement.” Iran “If Saudi Arabia is the financial engine of radical Sunni Islam, its neighbor Iran is the powerhouse behind the proliferation of radical Shiite Islam. Iran, OPEC’s second largest oil producer, is holder of 10 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves and has the world’s second largest natural gas reserve.

I don't believe that subsidizing will increase demand at all; it will just lower the costs for corporations.

To the first, I don't think the economy of the world rests solely on the 'leadership' of the rich; I don't think that we all look to them to what we buy. I'm pretty certain that I didn't buy my Lego Bionicle Phantoka toy because some rich kid bought one as well. As to the last two lines: Fuel doesn't have a noticeable effect on the economy? What???? ""while we're waiting for the rich to convert, what's happening? in the mean time, the poorer are spending their money on gas, or not being as productive as they could with cheaper gas or some gas at all. the middle class largely too. consider all that money they're spending on that, when they could be spending on an array of other things. all that money could have been going to the economy at large, instead of the pockets and costs of a few. (and foreignors, which is a major concern in and of itself)"" ---I have no idea what she's talking about here. Affirming this topic won't get anywhere in terms of the poor and the middle class spending too much money on gas; which I'll get to later. ""to make it more of a practical example. say a new biodesial machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand. all that money that the poorer are wasting right now would have been more than enough to either subsidize or lend to that station. (you could lend the money to them... and ensur ethey make a tidy profit before they ever have to pay it back, if ever considering there's a risk they might not make money) if we invested in them as a government then, the effects would be much sooner, and the poorer and middle class would save more, and it'd be a boon to the economy. (plus all the jobs involved with the transitioning infrastructure) there'd be so much savings, you could even lend or subsidize biodisal plants too, though it'd probably not be needed for them."" ---Alright, so here's where I present my argument: DairyGirl is basically saying that if we subsidize now then we'll get the technology and then suddenly everyone's saving money because biodiesel is cheap. I don't agree with this on two levels. First of all, it doesn't work that way. You don't just get the technology, the biodesel engine, and then ding! it's done. No, biodiesel has an ongoing cost. To get biodiesel we have to grow plants, corn, and various other things in order to grind them and process them into a burnable form inside an engine. In the case of ethanol, the costs that go into producing the corn outweigh the benefits that it produces, which even then, are none. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 12,000 to 1 (that's a .008%) ratio of water to the production of ethanol: The water used in ethanol can be used elsewhere, and with droughts sprouting up around the UNITED STATES, the use of water in the production of ethanol is wasted. And even then.... it's still pretty ridiculous. 12K:1? Are you serious? Second, EVEN IF Ethanol didn't take that much water to produce, it is empirically proven that theres more MPG in using normal gasoline/petroleum than in using E15 or E20. ""government intervention is the way to break the catch 22 sooner when it'll make a difference for hte economy, than later when we'll look back and see all that wealth that has been squandered."" ---Counterplan: Fund Alternative ENERGY. Alternative FUELS are just gonna take this country, and the world to sh*t. Or, the USFG should implement more liberal laws about the MPG requirements of cars; requiring like, say, 60MPG by 2015.

Japanese companies are already well on their way there: God, even my family's 10 year old Toyota has better mileage than a 2008 Chevrolet.

Yet, these fossil-fuel-based machinery can be replaced by electric vehicles and machinery, possibly supplied by nuclear power plants themselves. In sum, nuclear energy is inherently clean. It is only the processes surrounding it that are dirty. This can and will change.	PRO	507

Sbc6467-Aa113409c	Solar Electic Power	"The Deal Suppose you are an American homeowner living in a house worth $153,000. You now spend $1403 a year on electricity. Pro has a deal for you. Consider it carefully. First save up $90,283, then buy and install a rooftop solar electric power system for your home. The system will require $410 a year for extra insurance, you'll have to clean off the snow whenever it snows and take care of the batteries needed to run at night, and your real real estate taxes will go up. Your solar electric system will last 25 years, providing all the electricity you need for those 25 years. Then you'll need to replace it using new saved cash. Are you ready to sign up for that deal? I think it's not plausible, but if you're not sure, then the controversy over the exact costs and risks follow. I think the average homeowner would be ready for the exit right after the ""save up $90,283"" part. People aspire to pay off their mortgage, buy a better house, and put their kids through college, not become their own a mini electric utility. But that's just my opinion. Areas of Agreement We have agreed to important facts relevant to the debate, including the numbers cited above. We agreed to how much power is consumed by the average homeowner and what it now costs. I don't think there's anything controversial there. To carefully evaluate the investment, we agreed that money not spent on solar, the $90,283, could be put into a long term investment earning 4.3% interest. To limit the scope of the debate, I agreed to electric utility costs rising at 4.6% per year including, although logically rates ought to drop due to advancing technology. (Oil isn't used significantly for power generation.) More doubtful, we agreed to use an inflation rate of 2.5% for the 25 year period. The real estate tax rate is agreed to start at $10 per $1000 of assessed value. Maintenance, taxes, and insurance all increase at the inflation rate. We agreed not to count government subsidies for solar electric. The obvious subsidies are government tax rebates. The debate is about the real economics. We needed numbers to evaluate the solar electric investment, but their is risk in all the numbers. No one really knows what will happen to electric rates, taxes, or inflation. That's inherent in investment decisions. There are many risks to consider as part of this debate, and they count in assessing the viability of the solar alternative. The do-it-yourself option Installation and maintenance costs are significant. Pro offers the option of the homeowner doing his own installation and counting the homeowners labor as having no cost. It's like saying that you could either pay to take a ferry across the river to work, or you could build your own boat and use that. In the latter case only the cost of the wood for the boat should count. Pro says the minimum solar equipment cost is $44,283. I say it is more because he has underestimated the battery storage and that the part to tying into the house electrical system requires a professional electrician to meet code requirements. The do-it-yourself requirement is not an apples-and-apples comparison, so it shouldn't be part of the debate at all. If we were going to compare the cost of washing clothes at the laundromat versus using a washing machine at home, w wouldn't consider the option of building your own washing machine. For solar, or whatever else, we are comparing one ready solution to another ready solution. I pointed out that assuming free infinite labor makes many uneconomic projects appear economic even though they are not. There are many reason why a homeowner could not use the do-it-yourself alternative. Physical limitations may prevent roof work or limited skills might risk successful completion. The homeowner might not have the free time. The debate is about whether solar is a practical alternative, and the do-it-yourself option is not practical for many homeowners. I also also questioned if homeowner labor couldn't be better spent on more valuable work. The premise of the debate is that homeowner is able to save a lot of free cash, Pro says at least $44,000 for the equipment. That implies a very good job, not a typical household income of $50,000. I argue that our lawyer-living-in-a-$153K-home will be better of doing the work he qualified to do rather than playing solar pioneer. Pro rebuts that, no, it's just a salaried guy who has the time and no other work option. The problem is the unrealistic root assumption of having a large bundle of ready cash. The most realistic way to resolve that is to suppose the money is borrowed, but that blows up the cost of the solar electric system with high interest expenses. Borrowing $44K would have over $4K in yearly interest compared to the $1403 electric bill. That's out, and we are left assuming a very well paid homeowner. Maintenance costs Pro's plan is to use neighborhood kids to clean snow off the roof and other maintenance. I said you need some sort of a business to do that. Pro rebutted that the skills are minimal. Pro missed my point, which as not at all about skills, it was about liability insurance. I challenged Pro to include the cost of insuring an unlicensed neighborhood kid to work on a roof. I said I don't think it's possible to get such insurance. Pro didn't respond. There's a big downside risk to the kid falling off the roof. Aside from cost, you could end up in jail for child endangerment. I cited reference [3] on the required battery maintenance that includes inspection and cleaning off corrosion on the terminals and inspecting for bad batteries. The system is running at household voltage, 120 or 240 volts. That's anther another liability problem with kids working with high voltages. If one battery failed the whole set would ordinarily have to be replaced. Pro said he planned on replacing them all at end-of-life. That's not the problem. It poses a cost risk if one fails prematurely. You will get a new battery on warranty, but probably not a whole set. Taxes Pro argues adding the $90,000 system to the home will only increase the assessment by $30,000 or so. that would be logical, but localities are interested in collecting as much tax as possible so ""... a cost based approach may be used."" http://en.wikipedia.org... They use what it costs rather than what it's worth to a new owner. Being our own electric utility Pro counts on selling electricity into the power grid whenever surplus power is produced by the systems. Now, laws require that the utilities accept the power and pay for it. The requirement is a subsidy to home solar. The cost to the utility of providing electricity is mainly in the fuel for generators; Pro didn't contest that's only about a third. Two-thirds is in the capital costs including maintaining the grid. Utilities do buy power from outside their grid system, but they get to choose when to buy it and how much to buy. Meeting peak demands is the major need, as late on hot summer days when the air conditioning loads peak. That's precisely when home solar power does not have any spare to sell. Pro's notion of selling power into the grid evades all the costs of setting up and running the grid. For the power company, they save a little fuel cost if they can throttle back some generators, but the capital and maintenance costs are not paid by a system that only sells into the system when he wants to. Pro suggested that if the power company didn't want the power, it could be sold to neighbors. I pointed out that requires permission to set up a competing utility, and he dropped that idea. The bottom line My numbers in R3 withstand scrutiny. If the money put into solar were invested instead, after 25 years there would be $214,000 in the account, and $59,000 worth of electricity would have been purchased from the power company. Including the cost of capital, the solar electric system cost would 5.0 times the grid cost. The resolution is negated. Vote Con. Thanks for a good debate."	CON	514
Scb08147e-A2eaa698e	"the proper versus current approach to ""alternative fuels"""	"Let's remember that this debate isn't about me or where I see the future of fuel going. And though, due to innovation, existing infrastructure and the possibility of gradual implementation I believe it will continue to go in the way it has already shown a willingness to go (with plug-in hybrids already on the road and production models hitting the road soon in far greater numbers / get on the waiting lists now... it'll be a while with demand what it is). I was simply pointing out where I see the economy going. We have a massive investment in gasoline and it's going to take years to get away from it. Plug-in hybrids allow for a transition away from gasoline to another readily available infrastructure with energy, the power grid. The higher the price goes the greater the demand. The greater the demand the more people use electricity and buy cars with better mileage and more of a push for electric to be used. The technology used is improving and allows for massive amounts of additional innovation. We're already heading in that direction, and the higher gasoline prices and entrenched oil structure make my points more obvious. People aren't going to replace their cars or shift away from gasoline soon. This is a major reason I think plug-in hybrids are an obvious choice. We need to reduce demand and allow people to shift over to a more electric when the gas prices are high, to allow the gas prices to stabilize. However, this debate isn't about that, this debate is about whether ""Hydrogen is the only answer as a long term fuel replacement to gasoline"" or ""a fuel (hydrogen) can and will be able to replace in TOTAL the current and future consumption of Oil-based fuels like gasoline"" -- Do you recall any argument to this effect? He did suggest, ""Ethanol and ALL plant based fuels will NOT work over the long term"" He did not, however, make an argument at any point as to why hydrogen works. Hydrogen isn't a fuel source, it's produced by breaking water apart or by converting methane (already a fuel / fossil fuel) into hydrogen. That's hardly an amazing feat. Electricity -> Water -> Hydrogen -> Car -> Car moves. vs. Electricity -> Car -> Car moves. -- or Gasoline -> Car -> Car moves. (we aren't going to lose that paradigm soon) How did Solarman respond to these objections? How are the infrastructure problems overcome? -- Build it. Ship it in containers. Use natural gases' infrastructure. Something something... How is the leaky nature of hydrogen overcome? -- ""Non-issue."" How is the lack of cars overcome? -- YOU NON-SCIENTIFIC LIBERAL WITH YOUR TREE-HUGGING HYSTERIA! Why is hydrogen better than the current approach? Why will hydrogen work? Why is it the only solution? Why? I'd go to the trouble of refuting my opponent's argument, if he had an argument! All the technical problems with hydrogen which has constantly and consistently kept the technology on the backburner and given people pause is somehow ignored and everything else, even proven technology on the roads in ever increasing numbers, is wrong because... why? Other than matter-of-factly declaring things, solarman has done nothing to establish his argument (whatever it may be). He hasn't met his burden of proof or apparently even tried to argue his side. Problems aren't problems for him and solutions aren't solutions. Hydrogen isn't a bad technology, it simply has a lot of hurdles to get over before it become viable solution to our energy problems. The same can be said for a number of the technologies vying to solve this problem. Why is hydrogen different? This is what solarman would needs to have addressed in this argument and he perhaps should have given that a shot rather than being rudely typical. ------------------------------ -- ""how about aircraft? trucks and buses ? ships? spacecraft?"" Not every solution fits to every problem, there's plenty of room for trucks and buses and ships to store plenty of batteries. I am not aware of any major projects doing so currently. Though I've heard less about hydrogen on the point. Electric alone works fine depending on the range. Comparing hybrids with plug-in hybrids is a little bit off. Hybrids charge up their batteries in order to run the stop and go traffic of day to day life (which they are highly efficient at) without running a poorly suited electric engine for the task. A plug-in hybrid has more batteries and is better suited to accept electricity as energy rather than a buffer. -- ""By the second law of thermodynamics the energy in the hydrogen is necessarily less than the energy we used to split the water. That doesn't make it a fuel"" ---- ""WRONG . hydrogen is a fuel. period."" What an interesting way of violating physics: declaring it so! -- ""It can also be made from bacteria. and of course water (H2O)"" You managed to escape physics there too? Why don't you just burn the hydrogen resulting in water, generating power, then simply make more hydrogen out of water and start the process over again. You'd have a perpetual motion machine! If you're just going to ignore the laws of thermodynamics, go all out! -- ""CH4 + 2 H20 -- > 4 H2 + CO2 (4 : 1 ratio of H2 to CO2 (plant food) )"" 4 H2 = 8 Atomic weight = 8. C = 12.01 O2 = 32 Atomic weight = 44.01. Though, I'm glad to see you're going by the atom. *smirk* So if you put 1 gram of diamonds on a 10 grams of gold ring it's more diamond than gold? ""In central station hydrogen production from natural gas reforming, the mass of CO2 emitted is 2.51 times greater than the mass of hydrogen produced."" http://www.getenergysmart.org... -- ""No, hydrogen is a FUEL. It is a GAS. It is an ELEMENT."" You can't get energy from nothing. It's going to take power from the power grid or from a non-renewable source. -- ""Batteries can be improved."" ---- ""What this is is simply liberspeak hopefulness- which is fine."" No I gave you a great list of many of the improvements being made in batteries. Anybody with a cellphone can tell you that massive strides have been made over the years and new technology and innovation comes around all the time. We're already going in the right direction. Hydrogen is simply a battery, and isn't a very good one. Battery technology however is making fantastic strides in the right direction. And can continue to be improved ways elements cannot. -- For the little crap Prius , it is about 57 kW in power 57 kW @ 5000 rpm. That 5000 RPM is pretty important. Your calculations were still based on misunderstanding the term being discussed and it still works out to a bit over a dollar a gallon (as much as that makes any sense when dealing with electric energy rather than an actual volume of something)."

S3af9364a-A1d76d8aa	Nuclear Power is the most viable substitute from fossil fuels	"I apologize for leaving this to the last minute, but I will finish this debate. My opponent starts off by making the following statements. 1) Digging holes can't possibly be economical. My opponent asks me how digging holes can possibly be economical. Well, I thought it was obvious, but I will explain why ""digging holes"" is a very enlightened choice when trying to save money or even decrease our country's deficit. The reason why geothermal energy will be so economical is because EVERYONE WILL WANT IT. It will cost a lot less because you do not have a limited amount of it, as we do oil and plutonium. Creating geothermal energy could even be economic boom our economy needs right now. Weening off of our dependence on oil in the middle east. Now on to the science evidence your presented 2) ""To be both usable and economical a (geothermal) site must have an adequate volume of hot water or steam that is not too impure to use, a surface water source to cool generating equipment, and close proximity to power transmission lines. So, even in promising areas, economically usable sites are few and they are difficult to locate. "" My opponent here is assuming that we need to find areas that have water in them at high temperatures, and admits that it only takes a few miles of digging from anywhere for adequate heat, which as proven above is easily obtainable and economical. So the only real problem here is, we need bodies of water. OR the third option, which is supplying water ourselves. In the evidence I sited in my last speech, ""Enhanced Geothermal Systems"" are capable of such things. Hot rock reservoirs are given water and the steam from the heated rocks + water is harnessed as energy, thus also eliminating our need for perfect water bodies at our desired locations. It can be anywhere. Now onto my opponents refutations of my attacks. 1) My opponent offers a chart of deaths. First of all, I would like to see the link for this please. And since I cannot see the link, or a description of this chart, I assume that his survey was done in one week or month. There is no timeline. This evidence is incomplete. In opposition you also claim that mining uranium is like mining anything else, but offer no evidence on the validity of this. I offer the following articles as evidence to the contrary (1) (2) . My numbered one article specifically talks about the mining risks, but the rejection of the fact that retrieving nuclear energy IS dangerous because is puts off radiation is not productive in this debate. It is a FACT that radiation is created by particles traveling at almost the speed of light and can be very dangerous going through the human body. It can be the cause of cancer and sexual deficiencies. If even there has never been a death in the U.S., which by the way only claimed with no link to this source, it creates diseases to be passed down in their children, and becomes very serious. 2) A lot of countries have the ability to produce nuclear weapons, but they promised they wouldn't. But that's alright we trust them. We are giving countries the ability to produce nuclear weapons. Countries that hate democracy, countries that deny the Holocaust ever happened, countries that want to see the U.S. in flames. There is no way to turn geothermal energy into a weapon of mass destruction, exception maybe in a squirt gun fight. Giving other countries the ability to use geothermal energy and giving them the technology to accomplish this does not put the U.S. in a bad position to where we have to choose between environmental safety or preventing nuclear winter. In the world of the con, we have both pretty easily. 3) Nuclear energy is very cheap. So is geothermal energy, what's your point? Geothermal energy doesn't damage humans or our environment. 4) My opponent wants me to name a country that uses geothermal energy. A lot. What kind of an argument is this? Because it is not popular and funded as much as nuclear energy, it isn't as good? Well if I was thinking the same way as you then Justin Beiber and Lady Gaga are the best musicians because they are the most popular and richest. Or that the best race is Asian, because there are a lot more Asians in the world then any other race. That makes absolutely no sense and judges should just ignore this argument. In conclusion, geothermal energy is better because it is cheap and easy to obtain just like nuclear energy is, but we do not need to worry about nuclear proliferation and radiation if we share this information to the world. And if we can easily share our technology with other countries without needing to worry about WMDs, our environment can benefit at a much accelerated rate than nuclear energy ever would, simply because the US would not allow it. http://www.wagingpeace.org... http://www.physics.isu.edu..."

This would potentially be ok if it did not look like we are approaching a uranium peak. The peak in supplies of uranium seems likely to arrive sometime between 2030 and 2040 with uranium being almost totally gone by 2070 or 2120 at the latest. It is the peak that matters, as after this point supply will not be able to keep up with demand. If you take into account that nuclear energy produces 16% of world electricity, and less than 5% primary energy supply, it seems impossible to me for nuclear energy with current technology to ever satisfy a big part of the world's energy demand2.

""I will first point out the arguments that 'The transportation of nuclear material is safe' went uncontested and so I extend the argument."" Please pardon me, but I can't seem to find said arguments even after looking many times (this quote was your first use of the word ""transportation"" in the whole debate). As such, I apologize that I will not be able to answer them. That being said, I don't feel like the transportation of nuclear material is the most important issue at hand, so please don't worry too much about it. Your time would be better spent talking about pollution and disasters anyway. 1. ""I have already shown that with PBRs and Fusion Reactors, that meltdowns are physically impossible."" I was looking and I found a very interesting and in-depth article from Nuclear Engineering, Int'l (hardly a source that would normally support my point) that discussed why PBR's are not necessarily as previously assumed [1]. There were 2 PBR's in Germany, and both were taken out of use, one due to safety concerns, and the other due to technical difficulties which were compromising its efficiency, its cost, and its safety. If you would like more specific details, you may refer to the article, which goes very far into the details of both, but I thought the summation at the end of the article was very good at bringing to a level that we can all easily understand, and it is, ""In summary, PBRs contain certain inherent safety features compared to conventional reactors, they are however to some extent compensated by inherent safety problems. Some of these inherent safety problems can be solved by adequate safety measures or by R&D, but it remains uncertain whether this is possible in an economic manner. With PBRs, there is a tradeoff between economy and safety."" So you can have it be unsafe, and then that defeats your argument about them being safe, or we can have them be costly and inefficient, which would defeat the the most common argument for nuclear power which is that it is more economical than other methods. In reference to the fusion reactors, once again, that is much more expensive than the standard fission reactor, so that kind of defeats the ideas that it is more economical than other methods. The easiest and most promising fusion reactor cycle is the Deuterium-Tritium cycle. What that entails is slamming a Deuterium (Hydrogen-2) into a Tritium (Hydrogen-3) to produce a Helium atom and a neutron. However, this has many drawbacks. First of all, Tritium is very radioactive, having a half life of just 12.32 years. Since it is also a gas with an atomic mass of just 3 AMU, it is very difficult to contain. This will inevitably lead to Tritium leaks, which will mean that there will be radioactive material in the air. Tritium is a very dangerous radiation hazard when it enters the human body, and there will inevitably be leaks in any D-T cycle reactor. Also, in order to obtain Tritium, there has to be a fission cycle as well, as Tritium is in short supply naturally, so it has the various problems associated with fission as well. And it also produces about 100 times as many neutrons as fission cycles, which cause things to become radioactive. In fact, after testing the D-T cycle, the chamber in which it was performed had to be handled only remotely for a full year following the test. Yes, there are other cycles, but they are even less efficient, and they have problems of their own. It's just not worth it [2]. And about the wind turbine, I was mostly joking with that, but even as this one blew up, it didn't throw nuclear material throughout various countries, and it didn't cause the whole area to evacuate. 2. a. As I said, and you agreed, it goes away slowly. However, when we put it back, it's much more dangerous than the stuff we take out from nature. You're not going to find Pu-238 in nature, for example. And yes, it can be diluted, but as you conceded, it takes a considerable sum of money to do so, and thus that would make the whole process not worth it. b. ""Since the average nuclear site produces 20 tons of waste a year, 10,000 nuclear reactors (which is over 20 times our current world amount of 436[3]) would produce 200,000 tons a year, and would take 3,500 years to fill that one single location (and we could have more then one, easily)."" This assumes that the number of Nuclear reactors won't grow exponentially in the next 3,500 years. My guess is that since Obama is doing it, other countries will follow suit, and we will continue to make nuclear power plants, but I could be wrong. But even if we do have enough room to store it for that long, it's still not a good idea. There is a very real possibility of pollution. Should something happen to either of these facilities, there would be a catastrophic impact on the environment. c. ""(1 - (.5)^(1/324000)), or enough for almost 36 nuclear reactors running full time with the amount of waste they produce actually breaking down, so no net volume is added."" I have an issue with your math. Yes, your calculations are correct, but you said previously that there are 436 nuclear reactors in the world. You then proceed to say calculate what would happen if there were 36 nuclear reactors. Which means that you've left 400 unaccounted for, and counting. 400 is a big number. Also, you say that no volume is added. That is not the case. The volume doesn't go away after a radioactive isotope breaks down. It just turns into a new, more stable element. ""The argument that one must guarantee that absolutely nothing will go wrong is not realistic for anything, nuclear included. The only thing that needs to be done is that they are safe enough that the benefit out weighs the risk."" I think there is a significant difference between getting in a car accident and having a giant explosion which spews radioactive material for miles. As such, the risk should be considered much more strongly, and since you really have not provided any benefits, and the only one I can think of is that it is more economical, but I think that the risk of pollution and radiation already outweigh that benefit, so there is already no room for the risk of a disaster. There you go, the risks outweigh the benefits. ""If the worst incident in American history had no ill effects and we've made it so it is physically impossible for it to happen again, that indicates that they are, in fact, safe enough."" We can't predict the future. Something like that could happen again, or something worse. Or maybe not, but I'm not willing to take that risk if we don't have to. You already conceded that it's not possible to make it physically impossible to have accidents, so you just contradicted yourself. ""Other sources are great, however they do lack one fundamental thing. Consistency."" Oh, come on. You could maybe use that argument on someone else, but come on? What is the number one source of energy in Oregon? Hydroelectric power, of course. While I am not a big fan of the dams, there are less invasive ways, and the rivers don't stop moving. I would say more and write a good conclusion, but, alas, I am running out of characters. So, I would just like to conclude by thanking my opponent for an excellent debate.

He said that they would try to remedy that problem by having leaders find a safer and more secure way of storing nuclear waste. I'm going to tell you now. There is no way to permanently and securely store nuclear waste. Furthermore, the more we produce, the more we'll have to store. It doesn't go away. Even if we seem to not be having problems, eventually we will have a bunch of nuclear waste and nowhere to put it. That is horrible. How would you like another Chernobyl?

S3b786af9-A397e5379	Nuclear Power Vs. Solar Power (Future Electrical Needs)	"Thanks to my opponent for taking his time to write his argument. Solar plant Cost: $100 million[4] Capacity factor: 33%[1] Net capacity: 370.0 MW[2] Nuclear plant: Cost: $12.1 billion to $17.8 billion, two 1100 MW plants.[5] ($6.05-$8.9 billion for 1, if divided by 2) Capacity factor: 60.1%(2007-2011 UK average)[1] Net capacity(one unit): 365MW[3] As you can see, solar plants wins from every way except for the capacity factor. Safety The unsafe factors are not only Fukushima and Chronobyl. Here are some accidents that have happened:(from wikipedia) Serious nuclear and radiation accidents include the Chalk river accidents (1952, 1958 & 2008), Mayak disaster (1957), Windscale fire (1957), SL-1 accident (1961), Soviet submarine K-19 accident (1961), Three Mile Island accident (1979), Church Rock uranium mill spill (1979), Soviet submarine K-431 accident (1985), Goiânia accident (1987), Zaragoza radiotherapy accident (1990), Costa Rica radiotherapy accident (1996), Tokaimura nuclear accident (1999), Sellafield THORP leak (2005), and the Flerus IRE Cobalt-60 spill (2006).[6] Arguments Capacity: It would take more than five el-cheapo solar plants to produce the same average energy as one el-cheapo nuclear plant. However, from my imformation above, nuclear power does less net power than solar. Cost: A Nuclear Power Plant will cost less than half of a comparable solar power plant per megawatt. Even factoring in fuel, security and maintenance, nuclear power costs about 4 cents per kWh, and solar power costs 22 cents per kWh produced (7). The cost for building is lower with solar plants though, which is 100 million[4], 1/10th of a billion. Therefore there is no problem financially to build more to increase power output to lower the money consumers have to pay for the power. Life Span: A nuclear power plant can be used for twice as long as a solar plant. Why build 2 solar plants over 60 years if you could just build one cheaper, more reliable nuclear plant? Your source says that PV installation should produce electricity for 30 years or longer, and the effects of age on performance is limited.[7]Notice the ""or longer"". Land Use: It would take almost 20 square miles to build a 1500-megawatt solar plant, however a 1500-megawatt nuclear plant only takes 3 square miles. The nuclear plant therefore further reduced environmental ramifications for animals, by disturbing fewer habitats Many solar plants are built or will be built in deserts, like the one in California. [8] This is because deserts have lower cloud cover, making them good places to build solar plants. [9] Deserts have less than enough precipitation to support growth of most plants.[9] Plants are scarce in deserts.[9] Only few animals inhabit deserts, they are adapted to the dehydrated place. Therefore, solar plants do not destroy much habitats with lots of animals and plants. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org... [2]http://www.nrel.gov... [3]http://en.wikipedia.org...

Sbc6467-Ae6f64b44	Solar Electic Power	I want to thank my opponent for this wonderful opportunity to discuss and debate the economic potential and shortcomings of solar powered systems for your home. This is going to be broken into 3 parts. 1) The suggested solar power system and its initial costs 2) What one would have if one decided not to get solar and just invest the money and buy electricity from the grid 3) What one would have if one decided to invest in this solar system (lol) I will try to be as short as possible because 8,000 is going to be way too little for everything, but, oh well. 1)The Suggested System I strongly advocate being independent and being able to do things yourself to save money (such as learn to fix your own car, build your own computer, etc), so naturally, I would strongly advocate installing your own panels and such. I would argue that the difficulty is not so great that the average person cannot do it, as they do offer kits that come with step-by-step instructions. However, I also fully understand that many are not comfortable with working on new things, especially on their roofs. So I will present the numbers if you install yourself as well as having contractors do it. First, cost of material. We have the solar panels, the inverter, and the batteries. You can buy a boat load of accessories that make it look prettier, but that is optional and so not a requirement. First, we need to know how much energy we need. Our location receives an average of 4.5 sun hours a day (this takes clouds and everything into effect), but in winter, we drop to 3.5 (while summer is up to 5.5). Since a cloudy day in winter means we'll be getting only half energy with 3.5 sun hours, we need to make sure that even on those days, we reach 34.65 kWh (average daily use, by Roy's numbers in his R1). This comes to 19.8 kW system, which will cost $29,017.72 in solar panels [1][2]. It should also be noted that these solar panels come with a 25 year power output warranty. This means that they are guaranteed to provide energy for at least 25 years. If they wear down and start providing less, they will be replaced under warranty. While they will likely last more than 25 years, we will use 25 years as our estimated end point (since everything breaks 2 weeks after warranty anyway). We also see that we will want at least 20 kWh to power the home through the nights, however, I've opted for a slightly larger, 36 kWh battery system so that the solar panels have plenty of time to deal with cleaning every once in a while (that will give a little over 24 hours of energy, while covering for the nights without de-charging too much). These will cost $4,872.00 [3]. These have a 10 year estimated life (7 year warranty), we will assume 2 replacements needed over the course, at 9 years and 18 years. Since I do not know what batteries will cost that far in the future, I will go with today's prices (advanced tech will likely drive prices down, but inflation will drive it back up, so who knows). Our inverter needs to be able to both charge batteries, as well as feed back into the grid. I have selected this inverter for $1,911.34 [4]. It claims to increase battery life by up to 10 years, but we'll ignore this claim as there is no guarantee for it, so it is merely a sales pitch (in my mind). This provides 3,600 VA, well above the average, though I don't know what the average peak usage is (sources vary too greatly). If my opponent would like, I can select a larger one (it will only add 1% to the cost, so it is really marginal when compared to the panels and labor). This allows us to sell our extra electricity back into the grid, however, it should be noted that you sell electricity at wholesale value (about 40% of market value) [5]. This brings the total of our system (with a 9.68% sales tax, national average) to $39,266.60 for this 19.8 kW system. We must now look at labor (while I believe that people should be able to do this themselves, we need to understand that not everyone can). Most contractors will quote you for the total job about $7 - $8 per Watt. It is not possible to get an exact number because it varies depending upon your house, angle of your roof and many other factors. We'll just assume the middle of $7.50 per Watt. Kits come complete at about $5.50 per Watt (and most contractors use pre-done kits). This means that the labor comes in at about $2.00 per W, so a 19.8 kW will have about $39,600 in labor costs alone. This will bring our total up to $78,866.60 with labor. This covers all initial costs, now, we can move to long term costs and benefits. 2)Take the money and run This section will cover if you take that $78,866.60, put it in a utility bond (as suggested by my opponent) and buy their electricity from the grid. While they have a number of options, we should stipulate that they need to choose a safe investment. First thing to consider is that electricity gets more expensive every year. Over the last 8 years, we've seen an average growth of 4.6% (from 8.00 cents in Jan 2003, to 10.99 cents in Jan 2011 [6], look at the excel sheet for historic prices). This puts your yearly electric bill from $1,403.54 this year, to $4,130.34 in 25 years. If we take the $78,866.60, and pull from it only to pay for the electricity, we find that after 5 years, the balance is $86,934.44, after 10, $97,304.37, after 20, $117,112.10, and after 25 years, $124,921.20. This is the golden number to beat. Interestingly, the investment will peak at 28 years at $126,998.10 before electricity costs overcome it (and it will be gone by the 43 year). Of course, if we go with you doing the labor yourself, at 25 years this option will be at $16,148.87 and will dry out at 29 years (this makes the life of the solar panels extremely important). With this, there is no equipment to buy, nor maintain, nor any labor associated that one must take care of. It is all factored into your costs at the meter. 3) Invest in my system I do not have the space to outline in depth what my system will cost, and so will only make some brief points and go into it further in R3. This will also allow my opponent the opportunity to verify the costs of not investing in solar as well as checking out the initial costs of my plan. Here are a list of things I will be going into next round. a) Solar panels increase the value of the home. This will raise both home owner's insurance and property taxes, however, it will also count as a non-liquidable asset. b) Electricity can be sold back at the wholesale rate, which we will count as 40% of the retail rate (grows at 4.6% a year). c) Cleaning of the panels to be done 6 times a year (once every 6 months, and wiping off snow, but the winter cleaning can be done during a snow removal) d) Snow removal and basic cleaning does not need to be professionally done, nor does it take a lot of time. While safety can be a concern, it is no more dangerous than climbing a ladder to clean gutters, which a large number of high school kids looking for beer money will do (besides, kids are durable). e) Batteries are maintenance free for their warranty and without maintenance are still expected to live 10 years (I'm still going with 9 for my calculations). While doing maintenance will extend their life, we've already accepted the 10 year life (though they claim 12 and above). I will have to pass this to my opponent now.

Seaed4f92-A15632c90	Nuclear power plants should be torn down forever	"Well done Con but you see I still have a few tricks up my sleeves. Let me rephrase the part of: ""Nuclear power plants use Uranium as fuel which is scarce and will run out in 50-60 years."" The 50-60 years was just a guess because it might change depending on the actual demand of uranium. Let me rephrase point 4 from round 2. Automobiles and Nuclear meltdowns are two very different disasters. When cars crash and people die its a disaster yes? But the Chernobyl accident is much more disasterous. 93 people die everyday in the U.S but thousands died from the radiation leak and i dont know if its the right count but it may be in the 10,000's. would you be in a car accident or spend the rest of your life cut off from the rest of the world until you die from diseases like Cancer. And now for some points 1. Cost is also one of the major disadvantages of nuclear energy. It costs between three and five billion dollars just to build a nuclear power plant. Maintenance and operating costs are also high because lots of money must be sent on safety systems in case something goes wrong. 2.One of the most feared disadvantages of nuclear energy is the potential for weapons. Each year, every nuclear reactor is capable of making enough plutonium to build over thirty nuclear bombs. Nuclear plants must be secured well enough to prevent this material from falling into the wrong hands. And finally 3.Nuclear reactors only last for about forty to fifty years. So,Con this is a question for you: Would you live near a very dangerous nuclear power plant that might someday explode and leak with radiation leaving maybe millions people dying without and hope of surviving until their 60? I look forward to your argument,Con Add me!"	PRO	533
S4c598a77-A3a1c7db6	Nuclear power is a good idea	"As this is the last round, I do not want to bring in any more evidence on any cases unless it is brought up by you and I have to in order to defend myself. I am sorry, that is correct, I never did mention ""transportation"" only the safety of the containers that are primarily used in transportation. 1) My opponent brings up an interesting article about PBRs, however I don't really need to address it. This is because the very article he quotes has been disproven as outdated by one of my previous sources (#9 in round 1). http://nextbigfuture.com... directly targets the very source that my opponent lists (his #1 link in this round). I will just simply point back to that same article. Yes, Fusion reactors are currently expensive (as is everything when it is new). That doesn't mean that they won't get cheaper, everything does, heck look at how expensive and inefficient the first solar panels are. Also with tritium, since my opponent brought up the ""dangers"" of tritium, it is actually not very dangerous at all. We use it as a light for gun sights and watch faces [1]. This is because tritium only emits beta particles, not gamma rays, and so the radiation has little penetrating power and is actually only harmful is consumed or inhaled. It's safe enough that you could hold it in your hand (if it wasn't a gas), or on your wrist. 2) Pu-238 is not gonna be found in nature, but U-235 and U-238 and U-234 are and Pu-238 depletes pretty quickly in comparison. I also used the number 10,000 reactors to over exemplify the real possibility. And also, please remember that the site that I mentioned is not the only one we could have. We could have more then one. And considering that site holds the waste of 0.06% (meaning 1 out of 1686) of the worlds population but could take care of 8.26% of the world's nuclear waste, that proves that there is plenty of room for it all. As for the waste that breaks down, yes it is still there, and it can be moved now. And its space can be replaced by new waste. The ""giant explosion which spews radioactive material for miles"" is physically impossible. This has been said plenty of times and never disproven. The only ""risk"" is small leaks which kill a few plants and maybe a fish or two. As also shown (and not disputed) the worst incident in US history had no effects on any people. ""We can't predict the future. Something like that could happen again, or something worse."" Again, physically impossible with PBR and Fission designs. The only thing that can happen is minor leaks or a few dozen curries. The actual Pebbles (from the PBRs) are designed so that the nuclear reaction is unable to continue on it's own. So even if a terrorist group stole a ton of the pebbles and scattered them throughout a city, they wouldn't do anything to anyone. And tritium is beta radiation that is 1/250 the strength of uranium 235 (which we have been able to easily control since the 30's). ""You already conceded that it's not possible to make it physically impossible to have accidents."" No, I said that it is not possible to guarantee that absolutely will never go wrong. It is possible to guarantee that an incident like Chernobyl or TMI are not physically possible with these style reactors. ""Oh, come on. You could maybe use that argument on someone else, but come on? What is the number one source of energy in Oregon? Hydroelectric power, of course."" Hydro is currently supplies 2.6% of the US electricity demand [2] and there is only room to expand it by 50%, meaning it will top out at about 4%. I will leave it at that. ""while the debate was excellent, my opponent did not give any reasons why we should use nuclear power"" I do not need to, I only need to show that ""Nuclear Power is a good idea"" and I have shown that nuclear power is both safe and clean, and so is it's waste. That is why it is a good idea. I would also like to thank my opponent for starting a wonderful and enjoyable debate and hope that we may debate more in the future. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org...

S5ae629e3-A714eac34	Resolved: A just society ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy.	"Thank you for your argument! I will begin with my own and then address the pro case. ""This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation. The energy crisis is real. It is worldwide. It is a clear and present danger to our nation. These are facts and we simply must face them."" In July of 1979, President Jimmy Carter told the nation about the realities of our modern world. With the immense power struggle continuing between many developed nations such as the United States and China, energy production will become key to who will dominate the new century. It is because i agree with president carter and believe in the necessity of energy that i negate the resolution as stated by the pro. Aristotle believed that happiness is what all actions are completed for. We as human beings do things in order to maximize happiness, and we institute governments in order to achieve the greatest amount of security and happiness in a whole society. We must value happiness in this round, because all of our actions are done as a means to happiness. In order to achieve happiness, many things must be provided to us. When a government has been instituted in a society, it is there job to facilitate our happiness to the best of their abilities. I will use energy as my criterion, the most efficient way of achieving happiness in our modern age. Everything that we do must first be facilitated by energy of some sort, so we must prioritize the production of energy in order to achieve happiness. I accept all of my opponents definitions. Observation: Ought Because the resolution uses the word ought, my opponent must establish that a government has a moral obligation to protect the environment. Contention 1: The necessity of energy. In an article posted on CNN.com by Fareed Zakaria, he states that whoever is to dominate in the 21st century must have the energy problem figured out. The U.S. and her citizens have long enjoyed the success of our country as the world superpower in military, economics and politics. However we cannot hope to stay competitive without the production of energy. Those nations such as Saudi Arabia that have control of a large energy supply such as oil will always be competitive because of their stranglehold on nations such as the United States, and everyone that has ever purchased gas knows that this stranglehold is getting tighter and tighter as time goes on. When it comes to a decision of either drilling oil in Alaska to help ease the economic stress on citizens or not because of a possible disruption of the ecosystem, a just government must prioritize producing energy and increasing the happiness of its own people. A governments responsibility is to protect and enhance the lives of its citizens. A government that fails to do so to the best of its abilities is no longer just. I now move on to my opponents case. First on the value and criterion. He uses the value of life, clearly defined along with humanity, however we must see that life should not be the ultimate value because it will always exist. When discussing a just society, we already have a society with people in it in existence. To value life is to value something that already is there and will continue to be in the society. It is not contingent upon anything, including his criterion. We must prefer the cons value of happiness, because while we always have life, we do not always have happiness, as happiness is contingent upon many things. For his criterion, he uses the environmental wisdom worldveiw. This states that human life is not the most important thing on this earth, however he tells you the opposite when he values life and humanity. His criterion strictly conflicts his value at this point. Furthermore, his criterion also does nothing to promote his value. He does not prove at any point that if we respect the rest of nature, we achieve more life. He must draw this link in order for his value to be upheld. In his framework, he states on his observation two that we cant count the green movement over producing electricity. However the resolution states environmental concerns, which is exactly the reason that the green movement began. Dont let him attempt to restrict the debate in this framework, it must be rejected. On his contention 1 of Chernobyl, he cites the loss of thirty lives as the dire effects of energy production however i have three responses to this. First, although one bad nuclear situation has occured in the past, we cant ignore the benifits of nuclear technology. 35,000 cancer patients in the U.S. alone rely on isotopes produced in nuclear plants. So while many people died in this one instance, many other lives are being supported because of nuclear power. Second, at the end of the argument, he states that not only do we harm the environment, however he never gives any damages to the environment. He ignores the pro burden of supporting environmental concerns but rather attempts to create a level ground for both sides, in that event the con must win. And third, because he opens the door of using examples of failed energy production attempts, i will combat that with many more successes. The fact that you are on a computer reading this is a success. You turned on your lights when you walked into the room. Success. Many medical procedures using power have saved thousands and thousands of lives. When weighing examples, as all of his contentions attempt to do, the con side will always win. On to his contention 2, he gives the example of the toxic waste dump site at love canal. However this contention does not fit into this topic at all. The company dumping the toxic waste was a chemical and plastic company. Not an energy production facility. This event is no example of valuing energy production or environmental protection. It is not topical and so please disregard. Finally, on his contention 3 he gives the example of the gulf oil spill. As horrible of an event that was, we must once again weigh it on the scale. The U.S. consumes almost 21 million barrels of oil in a single day, giving us countless benifits. To say that we must eliminate the use of oil in order to prevent an oil spill every once in a great while is completely illogical. The absence of oil in todays world would completely collapse the economy. Oil is used in transportation, production, creating electricity and many other necessities. The lack of oil would eliminate the happiness of people on a large scale, which is not favorable in a society. In conclusion, we can see that all of my opponents arguments hinge off of his three examples, which i have proven are heavily outweighed when compared to the benifits of energy production. Look to these flaws and his value criterion contradiction and we can see that the pro has no ground. Thank you."	CON	542

Sa6b760ce-A3f483d05	Nuclear power.	"== Rebuttal == (1) Pro says Chernobyl led to 200,000 deaths. According to recent studies, the actual number is much higher: 985,000 people died. [17] [19] Even if the number is 200,000, that's still a massive impact. The consequence of a nuclear meltdown is an unacceptable risk. (2) Pro says the ""overriding message for nuclear"" is to ""assess what went wrong, and work to make sure it doesn't happen again."" The problem is that there's no guarantees it won't happen again. The reality is that nuclear power is extremely dangerous and there's nothing we can do to mitigate that risk entirely. (3) Pro offers evidence of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna as an example of a ""deadly dangerous 'fallout' from the Fukushima disaster."" The impact of that evidence seems to weigh in my favor, so I'm not gonna spend more time there. (4) Pro suggests that radiation isn't bad for us, because his son eats tons of bananas, but that's simply not what's at stake here. The radiation that comes from nuclear power, from nuclear waste or from a nuclear meltdown, causes death. The radiation used on bananas is calculated to ripen bananas quickly, but it's also calculated to remain at a safe level for consumption. (5) Pro makes an argument about the land affected by a disaster. For example, Pro notes that a bigger chunk of land than Florida was affected by Chernobyl. That's a chunk of land bigger than Florida that can't grow food or can't be used to sustain life. Pro says one day we might -- the key word there is ""might"" -- have technology to clean up disasters. However, these technologies are untested, and some might -- yes, ""might"" -- carry even greater risks. There's no way to know. The onus is on Pro, not the rest of us, to demonstrate the safety of these technologies, as well as their effectiveness. Furthermore, note that the technology doesn't exist today, so it's ultimately speculation. Technology that doesn't exist today isn't justification for investing in nuclear today. Finally, clean-up technologies that technology won't guarantee that disasters don't happen -- it just means we can use the land sooner than we otherwise could AFTER the disaster has already happened. (6) Pro makes an argument about the waste from nuclear power. I'm not sure what the argument is. He seems to be suggesting that we store nuclear waste in our backyards, specifically 2 pounds each. Except that number's gonna keep growing as nuclear waste increases. That argument is simply insane and unsustainable. Pro says the casks are safe, but anyone who says nuclear waste is entirely safe simply misunderstands the nature of nuclear waste. Contingencies can't be predicted ahead-of-time, which is why storage is such a big problem. The waste from nuclear power lasts thousands of years. And note: storing that waste effectively not only costs money, but it also poses a serious environmental problem. The Yucca Mountain plan isn't ever going to happen. Pro frames the issue as solely political, but it's more than that; it's the fact that it's so expensive and time-consuming. Waste storage isn't just political (i.e. we don't want waste in our backyards); it's also about the economics. == My Advocacy == Pro seems to have dropped my main arguments. Specifically, Pro drops my argument about the economic costs of nuclear. The costs include building the plants, storing waste, decommissioning plants, securing plants from terrorism, insurance, mining uranium, and then running the plants. Most of these costs must be passed onto taxpayers, because they're too high for private investors to choose nuclear power. I want to emphasize this point: The market prefers other options. That is one of the most important reasons to prefer renewables; they're not only cleaner and safer but also cheaper. Pro also drops my argument about nuclear power's vulnerability to terrorism, the risk of weaponized uranium, and the vulnerability to climate change. Finally, Pro ignores climate change almost entirely, including my argument that renewables are a better solution. Extend all these arguments. There's simply no reason to prefer nuclear over renewables, since renewables are proven clean, safer, and cheaper. They're available and they carry none of the risks associated with nuclear. == Sources == [19] http://www.globalresearch.ca..."	CON	561

As for your own ""one dollar produced, two dollars sold"", that doesn't matter if we're going to be using all that land and all that water for producing gasoline, when it could be used for other things. I don't need to provide any citations that the production of corn for ethanol will take up a lot of land. It's common sense. ""the real argument, though, i'm posing is that we should not be against the government's intervention, just because."" ---Just because period? Please give some explanation. ""you give an good idea about raising fuel standards... cause if they did that, then it'd be effectively like us paying two dollars a gallon again."" ---The problem with this argument is that there are two different choices from two different backgrounds. In the world of the PRO, the government would be ""effectively paying two dollars"" but then thered be more usage of gas and more usage of ethanol leading to more usage of land and more usage of water, whereas if you negate, then you have the same ""two dollars"" except only without all the other disadvantages of ethanol. ""you did a good job pointing out some of my unclear points, and have some good ideas, but my ultimate argument that the government should intervene, primarily with fuels (at least eventually), hasn't really been dismantled."" ---I honestly don't see why I have to attack directly and up-front the idea of government intervention. If I can prove that alternative fuels in general are bad, that's breaking down one of the premises you need in order to affirm, and that's all I need to do as the CON. ""you never responded to the substance of my argument: that having the fuel economy would save us money."" ---Yeah, I didn't. I never mentioned money at all in my case. I don't see why it matters, and I see different things that matter. Is there a problem? ""cause one thing i wasn't very explicit on. if they can make it for a dollar a gallon, and even if they sold it at 2 a gallon, which is what they say they'd be doing, it'd still work out right."" ---And I'm saying that regardless of how much money you make off of this, that doesn't suddenly mean that Earth has the water to supply ethanol. So what if you make money? You're wasting water, and I'm sorry to say, but resources are not unlimited. If they were, fine, your plan would work. But we don't. So that's why your argument fails. ""and there's a trasition period, but."" ---No transition period arguments here. I think those are stupid. ""not all things... lke that toy you pose as an example... come from the rich... but things like cars, which people notoriously buy used... is completely different, with that example as irrefutable proof."" ---Fine. Let's talk about cars then. I want to buy a Scion xD. It's like, 17K. Not a Lamborghini. Rich people don't give a crap about Scions. I like the xD because xD is a emoticon i use a lot on AIM. Therefore, the rich are not leading the economy when it comes to ""what do the people want to buy"". But regardless of my personal desires, you haven't given any evidence of how the rich DO lead. If you can give so many links for the ethanol stuff, I'm sure you can find some things on this. Please give me links in R3. ""and you never addressed the fact that demand would indeed be created or argued how it wouldn't. you simply asserted that no demand would be created... that it's just reducing corporate costs only.. just an assertion. if someone can get cheaper fuel, the catch 22 no longer exists, and they'd be more willing to go for an alt fuel car. it's really not hard.."" ---Ohhhh I get it now. So you're saying that if we fund alternative fuels, then things will become cheaper and people will want to buy that instead of Gasoline. I see. I'm sorry, my comment earlier was based on a misconception of what you were trying to say. But still. You're wrong. I'd like to point out to the audience that DairyGirl has basically disregarded my case merely by saying that 'I'm not hitting the real point'. I believe I AM hitting the point very well: I'm saying that the government should not intervene in alternative fuels because funding ethanol leads to really bad results. I have shown this through the 12,000 gallons of water to 1 gallon of ethanol ratio. Also, there are arguments that she didn't respond to that still stand true in this debate: Ethanol has less MPG than normal petroleum, and since cars can't run on pure ethanol and must use 15% or 20% mixtures, the overall result is that there is more gasoline usage, and more problems caused. Another is the benefits that will arise out of the government funding alternative energy programs (not alternative FUEL), and the benefits of implementing laws for higher MPGs. She merely disregards these, again, with an argument saying that 'I'm not hitting the point'. Oh yeah, I'd also like to point out: How the heck is she affirming? The resolution says ""government should intervene more with alternative fuel"". Well.... Intervene where? How do you intervene with more alternative fuel? Does the government like, go somewhere and douse people in ethanol? Her case has absolutely no link to what the topic is. Since the PRO has not refuted my points and I have proved that affirming the topic leads to many negative results, the CON is winning the debate."	CON	565
Sb3cf5511-A424453c8	Resolved: On balance, the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks.	"O1: The resolution reserves the power of fiat to the negative – meaning that if neither side is able to prove their side, the resolution must be negated by default. For the resolution to be affirmed, the affirmative must prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks. D1: Nuclear Power = use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work [1] D2: Risk = possibility of loss or injury [2] C1: High Construction Costs According to Dr. Martin Sevior of the University of Melbourne, the cost of the newest third generation power plants are well over “$3500 per KW [kilowatt].” In fact, the Westinghouse AP1000 – a power plant with four reactors, cost well over $8 billion dollars, reports the University of Melbourne's School of Physics. Even ignoring exorbitant start up prices, historical precedent points to massive cost overruns – common issues, such as design flaws and two hurdle licensing, that result in dire financial repercussions. Pundit Ivona Okuniewicz brings up the example of Long Island's Shoreham Site – a nuclear power plant that cost over $5 billion, even though it was never allowed to operate due to two hurdle licensing. Shoreham brings to light a great risk – even with billions of dollars spent towards nuclear energy, there is no guarantee that such funding will actually be utilized. At the point where this is true, needless capital deprivation elucidates negative impacts on the American economy. C2: Health Risks of Radioactive Mining The radioactive material, such as uranium, that is needed to fuel nuclear power plants emit radon gas. A study done by the British Columbia Medical Association reveals that “Radon radiation is a health hazard to workers in advanced stages of exploration, such as in tunnels and shafts, where very high levels of working levels have been recorded in low grade deposits (1600 times normal levels).” The study furthers, “Despite AECB claims to the contrary, the risks from radiation in uranium mining far exceed those of a 'safe' industry.” There are multiple negative impacts that result from radon radiation. Reinhard Zaire of Germany's University Medical Centre BF explains that excessive exposure to radon radiation may lead to serious diseases, including apoptosis, cancer induction, genetic damage to future generations, childhood cancers, and dose-response tissue reactions. Empirically, one can look to victims of radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in order to survey the horrifying effects of radon radiation. At the point where the mining of radioactive material proliferates diseases such as cancer, the humanitarian impacts of this point are clear. C3: Various Harms of Nuclear Waste ""It's [Nuclear Waste] probably the single greatest security vulnerability in the United States,"" says Kevin Kamps, radioactive waste specialist at Beyond Nuclear, a watchdog group. According to CNN, “In the United States, 63,000 tons of nuclear waste, the sum total of all the waste generated by decades of nuclear power, sits right where it was created -- at the power plants themselves.” There are several risks involving nuclear waste. Harm 1: Meltdowns CNN explains, “Power plants are very close to major population centers -- Washington, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago have reactors within the 50-mile fallout zone.” According to industry critics, if such waste were to catch on fire, the consequences would result in “an area the size of half of New Jersey permanently uninhabitable.” Historical precedent points to examples such as Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and even Fukushima Daiichi – incidents that demonstrate the dire consequences of radioactive material. Specifically, if one looks to the Chernobyl disaster – a catastrophic event which, according to pundits Marshall Brain and Robert Lamb, resulted in “the evacuation of at least 30,000 people, and eventually caused thousands to die from cancer and other illnesses.” The cause of Chernobyl was poor design and improper operation, and when the two converged – the Ukrainian reactor exploded, setting on fire 50 tons of nuclear waste. Similarly, an untimely tsunami destroyed Fukushima Daiichi's backup generators, resulting in a rise of temperature until a hydrogen explosion destroyed panels containing nuclear waste. Similarly, the Three Mile Incident involved failures in a power plant's PORV system, allowing large amounts of nuclear reactant cooling to escape. Now, the natural response would be: wouldn't the pragmatic choice be to simply store away the nuclear waste in a safe place – to prevent the worst of a plant meltdown? There are fundamental issues with this concept. The main problem revolves around storage issues. According to CNN, “industry critics want lawmakers to mandate that most of the waste, known as spent fuel, be stored away from the main reactors in certified steel and concrete casks, then have those casks placed in fortified buildings or earthen bunkers. But it's fallen on deaf ears in Congress.” Pundit Steve Hargreaves expands on this point, “Most of the waste sits close to the reactors in pools that resemble swimming pools. A smaller amount is kept outside in casks that critics say are poorly guarded. The reason so much waste is being stored at the nuclear power plants themselves is that the government hasn't figured out what to do with it permanently. Storing the waste in this manner was supposed to be a temporary measure until it was permanently buried deep inside Nevada's Yucca mountain. But thanks to a mix of geology and politics, that site was recently deemed unsuitable. The hunt is on for a new long term repository, but finding and building one will likely take decades.” At the point where tons of nuclear waste are found in large pools near reactors, it is very possible a natural disaster, human malfunction, or simple mechanical error could cause another meltdown. From looking at events such as Chernobyl, the negative impacts of future meltdowns is clear. The deaths of thousands of people from the explosion and through radiation poisoning, and other associated diseases, indicate a definitive and severe risk for the use of nuclear power. Harm 2: Facilitation of Terrorism: According to CNN, “It's also possible for terrorists to specifically target the pools. Reactors like the ones in Japan, of which there are 23 in the United States, are particularly vulnerable. The pools in that design are located several stories above ground, making them easy targets for shoulder-fired missiles or airplane attacks. Critics say the concrete and steel around the pools are designed to prevent radiation leaks, not to stop a missile.” A CRS report for Congress furthers, “he Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strengthened its regulations on nuclear reactor security, but critics contend that implementation by the industry has been too slow and that further measures are needed. Several bills to increase nuclear reactor security measures and requirements were introduced after the 9/11 attacks, along with provisions in an omnibus energy bill considered in the 108th Congress (H.R. 6). None of those measures were enacted.” From these two sources, a couple of facts can be drawn. First, a clear incentive for terrorists to attack nuclear power plants exists. The damage would be extremely detrimental to the United States – a terrorist goal made clear by events such as 9/11. Second, despite security measures within facilities, plants are not prepared to deal with air or missile attacks. Third, future security measures to prevent the air/missile vulnerable plants have been put on hold – or at the least, delayed. At the point where terrorists have an incentive and the means to attack a plant, one must look at potential negative impacts. In this case, a terrorist attack could result in two things: 1. an explosion similar to that of a meltdown 2. nuclear proliferation – risks involved with nuclear power."	CON	566
S9bc8d269-A1c45d4d0	Land-intensive solar power incentivizes clearing land, ecosystems	Because the sun's rays are diffuse, solar panels must occupy substantial territory to generate any significant quantities of power. As a result, solar energy is land-intensive, and creates a pressure to clear land of trees and vegetation to make way for solar panels.

So, even in promising areas, economically usable sites are few and they are difficult to locate. "" was directly taken from a website link I provided and was not of my opinion even though I agree to it. My opponent has yet to provide the real cost of digging a hole a couple miles deep and releasing many toxic materials as I have previously mentioned. My opponent is suggesting that we just transport thousands of gallons of water to our desired 2 to 3 mile hole and allow it to turn into steam. After that, we could just use this steam to generate our geothermal energy, or so he claims. While this is technically possible, the actions of this would make geothermal energy even less viable than it is currently. While I know that many people think of nuclear energy as very dangerous and radiation related, this is not true. Nuclear has been safe for more 20 years. There is a reason governments don't just dig holes in random places and dump water into it. While I am not part of any government, I suppose it to be because it is simply just way to expensive to do. As for my ""lack"" of evidence for mining uranium. I offer this link. http://www.world-nuclear.org... I previously believed that I had posted that link but now after checking I did neglect to add it. For the claim of the lack of deaths, I got that information from a book but also found it at the following link. http://www.washingtonpost.com... I agree with my opponent that radiation is very dangerous. However, studies have been made which have found that radiation beside nuclear plants is actually less than radiation around some places without nuclear plants. I offer this link http://www.scientificamerican.com... and http://www-formal.stanford.edu... As to my opponents second rebuttal, I am quite offended. I ask him to do his research first before making any rash statements. I have never said that many countries have the ability to make nuclear weapons nor any promise that they would not use them. There is A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CIVILIAN NUCLEAR PLANT AND A NUCLEAR BOMB. A huge difference actually. That is the reason why countries are having their nuclear plants made by foreign countries even if they don't possess the secret of the nuclear bomb. I believe there is a reason that countries do not use geothermal energy because it is neither cost effective nor can it produce energy en mass and enough to supply demand. Nuclear can. http://www.wisegeek.com... Towards the end of the article, one can see that many countries that have nuclear power plants are not currently holders of nuclear weapons. I wonder why that is?? My point on the fact that very few countries that use geothermal energy use it to produce very little amounts because there simply aren't that many places to make it en mass and still cost efficient. I ask my opponent not to twist my words. I specified for a country that uses geothermal energy over 40% not just use. There is a reason that countries do not use a lot of geothermal energy because it simply isn't that cost efficient and there aren't enough places where is economically viable. For nuclear however, there are numerous countries that use it over 40% as I have in my previous argument stated. I am rather confused by his statement of ""And if we can easily share our technology with other countries without needing to worry about WMDs, our environment can benefit at a much accelerated rate than nuclear energy ever would, simply because the US would not allow it."" especially the last statement and I would ask him to explain it. In conclusion, my opponent has failed to provide valid reasons on why geothermal would be a viable replacement economically and the amount of energy it can produce. They have instead offered a highly idealistic and extremely expensive way of how geothermal energy could in theory be produced en mass. Nuclear however, does not even need theories to produce energy that can supply the world. One just needs sufficient nuclear plants. I however, have offered reasons including nuclear can be done anywhere in the world and that nuclear is one of the cheapest energies that can supply our world. My opponent has failed to refute these two points and has instead sidetracked them while I have met his points head on. For these reasons, I strongly urge a pro vote."	PRO	569

Se6216237-Ab2bb0310	Resolved: Allowing deep water offshore oil drilling is in the best interest of the United States.	"Thank you for the opportunity to debate this critically important issue. I agree to all definitions set forth. I take a stance in opposition to the resolution. Offshore deepwater drilling is not in the best interest of the United States. There exist means of energy production that are not only safer for the environment, but are more viable in the long-term, and will have greater benefit to the economy. To address my opponent's points: My opponent claims that the damage done by the oil spill has been grossly exaggerated. However, the fact of the matter is that the true damage the oil spill cannot be assessed yet, as oil spills have long-term effects that will only be made clear years down the road. ""Scientists worry the oil deep below will get into plankton and the food web, maybe not killing species directly but causing genetic mutations, stress or weakening some species, with effects that will only be seen years later. ‘I think populations are going to be affected for years to come,' said Diane Blake, a Tulane University biochemist. ‘This is going to cause selective (evolutionary) pressure that's going to change the Gulf in ways we don't even know yet'"" (http://www.time.com...). While it may be true that the immediate effects of the oil spill are not as drastically damaging as expected, only time will tell what the true impact of the spill will be. Personally, I value the opinions of the scientists researching the spill more highly than the AP reporter my opponent quotes in his argument. It is true that the spill has largely steered clear of the beaches of the Gulf, but scientists have discovered that the oil that sank to the ocean floor did significant damage to the sediment. ""University of South Florida's Ernst Peebles said the oil on the floor ‘is undermining the ecosystem from the bottom up.'"" Additionally, while Time may have stated that the spill killed less than 1% of the birds that died because of the Exxon-Valdeez spill, we must keep in mind that the Exxon-Valdeez spill happened over a decade ago, and we are still seeing the effects of it. We would expect that the amount of damage done by the more recent spill would be fractional in comparison to the Exxon spill because that statistic quantifies data collected over years, whereas the Horizon spill happened only months ago. It may be true that, to a certain extent, we ‘dodged a bullet' in regards to the damage done to Gulf beaches, Louisiana Wetlands, and the spread of the oil up the East Coast. However, it does not actually matter whether or not the oil spill did AS MUCH damage as predicted – the fact remains that the spill caused damage because offshore drilling is legal. Outlawing offshore drilling would prevent even the possibility of these disasters happening. My opponent astutely points out that the spill cleanup was poorly handled by the government. However, this point works in my favor. There is no reason to suspect that future governments will handle cleanup efforts any better than the current one did. Many politicians accept donations from oil companies who expect those politicians to represent their interests, including President Obama (http://www.nytimes.com...). There is no reason to expect that oil companies will not continue to donate to future politicians. My opponent notes that 11 lives were lost when the oil rig initially exploded. He points out that oil-rig workers are fully aware that they are participating in a dangerous occupation and are paid more as a result. However, workers have claimed that Exxon did not inform its workers of the radiation risk they faced while at work (www.nytimes.com). In regards to the Deepwater Horizon spill, a rig worker noticed a dangerous leak which was reported to BP, which failed to repair it www.businessweek.com). Even the BP employees hired to clean up the spill say they were not wholly informed about the dangers they would face while working on the cleanup (www.chron.com). Oil companies are negligent when it comes to the safety of their employees. As such, it is unfair of my opponent to claim that rig workers are fully aware of the dangers they face. Natural oil spills, as my opponent calls them, do in fact account for the majority of the oil that ends up in the ocean. However, the fact that the ocean floor leaks oil naturally has no value in this argument. The fact remains that leaks from off-shore platforms still pose a significant risk and can still cause great damage. Part of the reason for this is that they are located so close to the coast, where they pose a greater threat to the United States. Natural leaks could occur anywhere – however, we have control over where rig-leaks can and cannot happen. Natural spills will occur no matter what we do, but we have the ability to prevent man-made disasters from happening by banning off-shore drilling. It is a known fact that eventually we will run out of oil. Eventually, we will need to find a new major source of energy. New energy sources present great economic opportunities including job creation. My opponent points out that 400,000 jobs will be lost if off-shore drilling is banned, and 270,000 jobs could be created if more platforms were opened, for a total of 670,000 jobs. However, there are far more jobs in alternative energy than in off-shore drilling. According to a study conducted by the University of Illinois, the University of California, and Yale, switching to alternative energy means a potential 1.9 million jobs would be created. In the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana alone, around 180,000 jobs would open (in just three states, that's roughly a quarter of the total jobs off-shore drilling would create) (www.alternative-energy-news.info). As we are well aware, the vast majority of the money generated by oil drilling is not flowing into the coffers of the United States – rather, it goes directly into the pockets of oil executives. Creating new sources of energy production gives us the opportunity to restructure and regulate the money flow so it would have a greater benefit to the United States government– a much more manageable task than attempting to create a new monetary framework for the oil companies, which would mean fighting the politicians who have been in the oil companies' pockets for years. Finally, my opponent claims that banning US companies from setting up platforms would be a wasted opportunity, as foreign companies would simply sweep in and set up shot on vacant wells. However, there is no reason that a full-on moratorium banning drilling by both foreign and domestic companies could not be put in place. Additionally, by setting up new oil platforms instead of establishing renewable means of energy production, we are essentially saying that we wish to continue using oil as a primary source of fuel. This means that we will be forced to continue economic relationships with potentially and known-to-be dangerous countries including Iraq and Saudi Arabia, as we are forced to import much of the oil we need to power the nation (http://www.globalpost.com...). Even if we opened more platforms to supply ourselves with more oil, we would still need to import oil to meet our demand. I challenge my opponent to prove that we could completely sever ties with hostile foreign nations through off-shore drilling. If we established a solid energy network based on renewable energy that could be produced in the United States we could opt out of funding dangerous foreign governments. Are we willing to sacrifice the environment and human lives for short-term economic gain? Why not take immediate measures to create renewable energy that will do less harm to the environment, create safer working conditions and new jobs, and help us to become a nation that meets its energy needs domestically rather than being forced into partnerships with hostile nations simply to meet our need for oil?"

S57476c56-A7c716020	government should intervene in the transition to alternative fuels	"I'd like to remind Pro that the economy is not a being per se, so it can't hurt itself. The economy is the result of interactions between humans like you and me, so the ones who can hurt it are you and me. Also I'd like to point out again that electric cars are no longer a product only made for the rich, they're in the financial reach of almost everyone. New factories and expansion of production, like the Tesla battery plant (http://www.teslamotors.com...), will reduce costs further. Also the EPA predicts a further decline in battery costs over the next years (http://energy.gov... + other sources). No, government involvement is not the best bet. First, it creates artificial demand, meaning that the gov subsidizes the cars but these subsidizes, the demand they try to reflect, are by far not the real consumer demand. Secondly, the money for this involvement, whether it's subsidizes or the drafting of new laws, requires money, which normally comes from the tax payers. What leads me to my third point: ""the point we're debating it has to do with whether it's the best efficiency or not"" ... we are debating the efficiency behind it and I argue that the market is more efficient than the government. In the market, sales revenues flow to the company's finance department and then to e.g. R&D (what makes the cars cheaper and better in the end, as side note). When government intervenes you have to send all the monetary flows through bureaucracy, legal affairs, middlemen and in the end a large part of the money is eaten up by those processes. Demand and infrastructure are not correlated in my eyes. Take a look at Tesla and their Supercharger stations (http://www.teslamotors.com...): I doubt that every station is already used now. It looks like if Tesla builds the infrastructure to raise demand, therefore you can't argue ""no demand cause no infrastruction"". Again, there's not ""no"" demand for alternative fuels, just lesser than for non-renewable, at least at the moment. ""so yes, we would be forcing an artificial demand by driving down costs to consumers and suppliers. but that is a good thing,""... No, it's not. Who pays for the reduced costs if the government intervenes? I've answered this question before. The market is the most efficient body per se, the government is just a major player in it. The government may influence the demand and supply, but the better way is if these factors are driven by consumers. ""con points out that nonrenewables are cheaper. yes, they are, but that doesn't mean we should just allow things to played out as is until that is no longer the case, in a free market way"" .. The market will notice increase in prices once we can't rely on these resources anymore, and it will look for alternatives. Yes, it'll take longer until the market switches compared to gov intervention. But market makes the better decision, as it represents >300 mio people, whereas gov represents, in the last resort, 1 person. Also I ask Pro to put a little more sources and explanations into his arguments, it's hard to find a response if I don't even know how you come to that conclusions."	CON	576

[Response:] Within 40 years, used fuel has less than one-thousandth of the radioactivity it had when it was removed from the reactor.

S991e76d8-A179da683	In many senses nuclear energy is clean. It does not produce gaseous emissions such as greenhouse ga…	In many senses nuclear energy is clean. It does not produce gaseous emissions such as greenhouse gases, which are harmful either to the population or to the environment. It is true that it does produce radioactive waste. Since this is in solid form it can be dealt with much more easily and stored away from centres of population. The damage caused to the environment and populations due to the burning of fossil fuels is far in excess of the damage done to the environment due to the nuclear industry including even the Chernobyl catastrophe. In this sense nuclear energy is very much preferable to the burning of fossil fuels at the moment. Furthermore, as new technology becomes available to allow the more efficient use of nuclear fuel, less nuclear waste will be produced. (A recent example is the development of the fast breeder reactor, which uses fuel much more efficiently.) However, this trend will only continue with investment. Judging from the pace of development of nuclear technology since its inception it is fair to say that with more investment nuclear energy will become an even more desirable source of energy with many of its current drawbacks curtailed. The high price of oil at present looks set to continue, and makes the economic case for investment in nuclear power even more attractive.	PRO	579
Sd3d77219-A5bda32b1	the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels	"sure, i would suppose that we shouldn't support ethanol due to the harms it causes on food supply and costs. there are plenty of other sources mentioned, such as algae and switch grass, and maybe sugar sources like brazil, etc that could be used. and, i do not see a problem with various energy sources you pushed for, such as natural gas, and some of the benefits you gave, at least for the sake of argument. it is somewhat beside the point, though, of whether the government could increase our economic efficiency by intervening instead of letting pure free market economics dictate the result. con argues ""even assuming that governments are more efficient and making them be produced, it begs the question whether or not we need them to decrease the climate threat"". he is pretty much overlooking that the focal point of this debate IS whether the government can increase our efficiency. if we assume that, then the debate is pretty much over. if we get into climate threats, i will just grant whatever you argue for the sake of argument, cause it is beside the primary points being debated. the current energy sources are bad, because they put a strain on our economy by taking resrouces from he masses that could be going to supporting various other industries instead of just one, an better supporting the eocnomy at large. the CO2 thing is a factor too, in that a far majority of scienitits consider it a bad thing, but it's not worth getting into a CO2 debate about given the focus of the debate. "" was truly efficient, it would not need government intervention"". i gave the example of the catch 22. no supply cause no demand, no demand cause no supply. big money would surely intervene if there was a clear outcome as to waht will be our replacement for gasoline. but, it's not clear enough what it will be. it is clear though, that there will be something. if it's not a high enough chance of success, say 50 or 60%, or... if the returns are too remote in time, private investers won't do it. that doesn't mean the government can't interven when it's only a 30 or 40 percent chance, or whatever is the most likely alterantive, or when the returns are remote for a private invester but not remote for economic benefits to society as a whole if done sooner than later."

S7729e8b4-A475f1db	Being the only realistic alternative to fossil fuel energy, expansion of the technology must be available through trade.	Although this argument seems to be a rephrased form of the previous argument, team propoition will be dealing with it again. Team opposition will have you believe that countries that are incapable of producing such technologies themselves should promptly be offered this technology by other more developed countries. In doing so, they fail to realize the security threat the region will face if this sensitive technology gets transferred to countries that are incapable of maintaining and securing it. It is crucial under this case to see how even one incident caused by such a lack of responsibly by an importer country will devastate the whole region. Furthermore team opposition fails to realize that it is nuclear technology we are debating on. They fail to even notice the great security threat it poses to the region when one power plant in one incapable, under developed country falls short on security measures and cripples the economy of the region, in addition to a potentially colossal loss of life. We at team proposition realize the importance of even the life of one individual, who may lose his/her life just because of the incapability of the state. As we explained time and again, under developed countries lack the resources and expertise to maintain and secure such imported nuclear power plants, if they did have these resources and expertise, they would initiate their nuclear program themselves and hence the threat to their security cannot be ignored. Just because it seems nuclear power can replace the use of fossil fuels does not mean that the threat to global security be ignored. According to statistics, 43% of nuclear power plants in the US failed in countering mock security threats. What would happen if we transfer this technology to countries in Asia and Africa that are completely incapable of dealing with even minor security issues? At team proposition we cannot ignore this threat.	CON	581
S5ae629e3-A581967f2	Resolved: A just society ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy.	"-> For those judges unfamiliar with LD debate, it is a value centered debate. I'll explain more in the comments section later. As John Muir once said, ""When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe."" The point being that not only is human life dependent on nature and it's abundance, but all life it co-dependent on each other. Without a strong value placed on the environment, we will not be able to survive. Therefore, I affirm the resolved, that ""A just society ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy."" The highest value we can hold when looking at this resolution, would be that of Life. Life is defined by Princeton.edu[1] as ""a characteristic state or mode of living"". At the core of all human values, we must first hold the value of life, without it we lose our humanity, and other people are simply disposable. Once we realize this crucial fact it cannot be denied life is in fact the highest value to be held. Thus in order to achieve this value, I offer the criterion of the environmental wisdom worldview. This theory contends that nature exists for all the earth's species and we are not in charge of the earth; resources are limited, should not be wasted, and are not all for us; we should encourage earth-sustaining forms of economic growth and discourage earth-degrading forms of economic growth. Essentially through this criterion we discard the faulty idea that humanity is the end-all final creation of nature, accordingly an anthropocentric value of energy is worthless as to all life. It is only through affirmation of the resolution that we can maximize protection of life, and ensure the most life. Going on, before we get into the bulk of the debate, I'm going to offer some framework for clarity. = Definitions = Just[1] ""good: of moral excellence"" Prioritize[1] ""status established in order of importance or urgency"" Ought[2] ""used to express duty or moral obligation"" Concern[3] ""Be relevant or important to"" = Framework = Observation 1: Conflict- The resolution implies that there must be conflict between these two sides, otherwise we wouldn't have to prioritize one thing over another unless there was an issue between the two. This means that there is no fiat in this round. Observation 2: Environmental Concerns- because the resolution uses the word ""Concerns"" instead of ""issues"" we can fairly dictate that ""Environmental Concerns"" is relevant to issues of pressing importance, and not just anything that has to do with the environment. i.e. I don't have to defend that the green movement is more important that producing electricity. = Contentions = Contention 1: Chernobyl Accident 1986- From the World Nuclear Association; [4]""The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl a nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the product of a flawed Soviet reactor design coupled with serious mistakes made by the plant operators. It was a direct consequence of Cold War isolation and the resulting lack of any safety culture."" "" The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel. The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere and downwind. Two Chernobyl plant workers died on the night of the accident, and a further 28 people died within a few weeks as a result of acute radiation poisoning. "" In this contention, we begin to see the dire effects on human life when we prioritize the production of energy over environmental concerns. Because of the Cold War, Ukrainian citizens where forced, by any means necessary create energy. Regardless of the effects on the environment, or safety issues. In fact even still today in Chernobyl and surrounding areas, citizens [4]""still suffer from an increased rate of thyroid cancer."" When our main goal is production of energy, not only do we destroy our environment; but we throw caution to the wind in regards to matters of safety. Contention 2: Love Canal Disaster- From the Columbia University Press; [5]"" section of Niagara Falls, N.Y., that formerly contained a canal that was used as chemical disposal site. In the 1940s and 50s the empty canal was used by a chemical and plastics company to dump nearly 20,000 tons (c.18,000 metric tons) of toxic waste; the waste was sealed in metal drums in a manner that has since been declared illegal. The canal was then filled in and the land given to the expanding city of Niagara Falls by the chemical company. Housing and an elementary school were built on the site. By the late 1970s several hazardous chemicals had leaked through their drums and risen to the surface. Investigations confirmed the existence of toxins in the soil and determined that they were responsible for the area's unusually high rates of birth defects, miscarriages, cancer, illness, and chromosome damage. Families were evacuated from the area in 1978, and in 1980 the Love Canal area was declared a national emergency."" Again, we see the effects when we value production of energy over the world we live in. Contention 3: Gulf Oil Spill- Who can forget Gulf Oil Spill, which only one year ago ravaged not only America's pocketbooks, but our lives, and the environment as well? Even with all the exhaustive efforts in cleaning up this huge mess, we can see that still today we're experience the of this environmental disaster. Boston.com asks the question [6]""What is the cost of spilling almost five million barrels of oil into the ocean? How do you measure that cost? In GDP reduction? In lives affected? In environmental impact? And how do you measure the cost when long-term effects are impossible to calculate yet, and when a significant portion of the spilled oil is still unaccounted for? One year since the Deepwater Horizon platform exploded, killing 11 workers, there are measurable effects, and many more unknowns."" The site when on to report some devastating effects still lingering today, including [6]""Oil tar balls still washing ashore in L.A., Wildlife dying from poisoning, Shoreline erosion, Human lives lost in oil rig explosion, Businesses suffering from lack of resources, Multiple health problems from unclean water, and many many more."" = Conclusion = To conclude, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt that when in conflict any society that holds a standard of moral excellence, must prioritize Environmental concerns above the production of energy. Until we can do this, we will never be able to maximize the longevity of human life. Finally, I leave you with this question to consider; what good is energy to a dead man?

Paragraph by paragraph: Global Warming impact: 1) Cross-apply evidence from round 2, this proves that the uncertainty is still up in the air. It is not definite that global warming exists. 2) Further evidence: ""The attempts of environmentalists to bolster the myth of human-induced global warming is downright immoral."" Philip Stott, Professor of Biogeography, University of London 3) Further evidence: ""Global Warming Lies was created because when you do an internet search on global warming 99% of what you find is how the Earth is doomed and we are all going to drown from global warming. This isn't the case, in fact most climatologists will tell you differently. Global Warming Lies is an attempt to break down the science into everyday language, provide facts, use logic and common sense instead of the ""You're going to die"" method."" (from: http://www.globalwarminglies.com...) ---> This website also shows a graph that shows the 20th century as NOT the highest average temperatures. 4) I've heard scientists say that ""It's the warmest it has been in a century""… but obviously the average has to change sometime. In the 70's, people were worried about global freezing. 5) Lies about global warming are various. There are 2 major entities here, Al Gore and the media. Al Gore: Made a video about global warming but in fact, that video has several lies. One of which they took a clip of a polar bear on a little piece of ice, they claimed that that polar bear was like that because of global warming but in fact, that clip was from a video about how polar bears like to be on small pieces of ice covered by water. Furthermore, Mr. Gore has a HUGE airplane that pollutes loads AND owns one of the most polluting plants in the world… Nobel Piece Prize… HAHA. The media, on the other hand, has the exact same incentive… money. The media makes stories that sell and since people like hearing about (bogus) theories that COULD end the world, they will run them. The media is the biggest reason that this has been made TOO big of a deal. If one person that is respected begins to believe in any theory that could cause a lot of harm, then the media will believe it and run the story. If you think about it, it makes loads of sense. 6) (my most important argument)… even if global warming DOES exist (which it obviously doesn't), his plan won't solve any of its problems. From the same website as above, ""Don't live in a house/apartment/condo or any building that uses gas or electricity - Homes produce 2-3 times as much carbon as cars.""… You'd have to see that if you were to solve the ""harm"" of global warming, just stopping gasoline cars wouldn't be enough. He has NO inherency, NO harms, and NO solvency. 2--> The next argument talks about the changes of earth's temperatures. This is exactly what happens, going to the site above (same site), you will see that the data was false and that the 20th century is NOT the highest average temperature ever. You have to see that there is a ""fastest"" increase sometimes and just because it might be now doesn't mean that we caused it (and not by our cars). I've already proven that the problem would not be solved. Topicalities: A. I am still interested in how this ""energy"" could be used… for what? It has never been specified. B. There is no link as of THIS ROUND that proves that solvency will be a SUBSTANTIAL increase and he is therefore non-topical. PLAN STANDARD: He has yet to show that businesses are interested in the growing of this crop. The standard not being PROVEN means that there is no increase (let alone a substantial increase).

Cross-Apply farmers to businesses. With the businesses making this ""change"", it will be an even greater funding DA C-E: Common-knowledge… less people making stuff will lead to less stuff… From here, I would like to point out that Affirmative never chose between not having a substantial increase OR having a substantial increase but then having a substantial decrease in the production of everything else. It is one or the other because there is no way to determine the perfect amount. With all of this, you have to see that Affirmative has no case and therefore vote negative (con). Thanks!"	CON	583

S5ae629e3-Acdcb69d6	Resolved: A just society ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy.	"Thanks for this debate so far! Its been really fun! I will start off by defending my case and then returning to the pro. My opponent starts off on my value of happiness. He simply states that he believes happiness to be the most shallow value that can be held, and that it is simply a fleeting emotion. However my opponent fails to address my actual argument and the merits behind it, instead he argues the word itself. I use Aristotle's view on happiness, which is that we as human beings, act in a way that will bring us happiness. So however shallow my opponent believes this value, one of the more intelligent minds in the history of our planet believed it to be the ends that all human beings are searching for. He then states that happiness is subsidiary to life, however i will address this point when i look to the pro case.* Finally, my opponent says negation will not achieve or maximize happiness, however this is easily refuted. I would be extremely angry if i wasnt able to use my computer because of a blackout caused by a lack of energy. While happiness may be contingent upon other things if we were in a state of nature, because we have advanced into an age where energy is a necessity to everyday activities such as driving and making my coffee in the morning, the lack of energy will result in a lack of happiness. He then addresses my criterion of energy. He states that it is not weighing mechanism, which is not true. Yes it is a strange criterion, however the fact that we are debating an energy resolution makes it a weighing factor. Im using energy on a whole as a way to power everything that we use, not suggesting that somebody gets happy by playing with an outlet.:) On to my contention, my opponent says that that first, we have had the option to switch to a different type of energy for a while now. This doesn't refute anything however, it simply moves from my one example of oil to a different example of energy. The argument i make here is that everything we do is run from energy, so no it does not have to be oil, but you still need energy. Second, where he says i have no impact, this is false. The impact would be that almost every single thing we do consumes energy of some kind that must be produced. Thats a pretty large impact considering the backlash that would occur with a loss of energy in our fragile nation we live in today. I would like to address something here that my opponent drops in his arguments, therefore conceding to it. I make the observation of the word ought, and how my opponent must prove that a society has a moral obligation to prioritize environmental concerns. Because my opponent has conceded to follow this, dont allow him to come at the end of the third round to argue framework. He must prove the moral obligation, which he has not done to this point. Now on to the Pro case. On his value of life, his response was dinosaurs. I understand the argument he makes however he is misunderstanding the argument that i make. If the resolution were something along the lines of, ""to sustain a just society, we ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy"", then the value of life makes sense. However, because the resolution gives us the information that we already have a just society, we need not value life. The resolution will always have life included in it. There is no flip-side, that if we negate we lose life or anything. Pro will always have life in the debate, con will always have life. Rather than argue something that is implicit in the resolution, we need to go where there is question, hence my value of happiness. On his criterion of The Environmental Wisdom World View, first off, thanks for the clarification of the value-criterion connection! Now, my opponent argues that we shouldn't act in a way to selfishly benefit ourselves if it hurts nature. However, we must see that a society on its own does just this. The fact that people gather in close proximity to each other to enjoy the benefits of a social contract in itself harms nature by forcing animal habitats to change and possibly harming an ecosystem. The only way that we can actually achieve what my opponent is advocating is to abolish the formations of society in order for the masses to not harm nature. Second, the fact that humans must consume nature in order to survive also defeats his criterion. If we didn't harm nature, not only would we be in a state of ungoverned nature, but we would all eventually die without food or water for consumption, strictly going against his value of life. On to his contention one, Attack one. First he states that there are other cures to cancer that cannot be marketed as drugs in the United States. However this fact does not change my attack. Regardless of what COULD be used, im telling you what IS being used. Prefer this because im showing you the benefits that are occurring in the present. Second, he states that the vast majority of people who get cancer die from it anyways, however this doesnt justify letting the 2% that survive die as well. That two percent, as small as it is comparatively to the whole, is far more than the small number who died at chernobyl. The con better achieves the pros value of life on this contention, as well as my own. On my attack two, he states that there are increased levels of thyroid cancer, however he never impacts this. A simple rise of one person getting thyroid cancer is considered an increase, and thyroid cancer has a 97% successful cure rate. This argument has no impact. On the attack three, he states that i never solve for the harms. This is true, i cannot say that this example was in any way good, however my argument is that one bad egg doesn't ruin the rest of the dozen. When we compare this failure to the mass good that energy has brought the world, it is very heavily outweighed. I agree that no amount of technology will ever equate human life, however, no amount of environmental conservation will either. On to the contention two, he attempts to make up for his mistake by saying that the chemicals were used in energy production. However this is not believable. First, he doesnt even give the name of the company. Second, he doesnt tell you for what these chemicals were used for. The second part of his argument is that energy was produced there. However this does not fit in the resolution. He states himself that this section of land was toxic. This case was in no way an example of the people valuing energy over an environmental concern. First off, they didnt know that the land was a toxic dump, and second, even if they did produce energy, which you dont prove, they wernt harming the environment there any more than it already was. This argument simply is not topical, and your attempts to salvage it may be making you worse off. Lastly on the contention three, this is extremely similar to the contention one. He gives an argument that paints a loss of life and property. However, once again i must tell you to look at the scale of things. There is a large majority of success stories to outweigh this A-typical case. Furthermore, once again he states that their are other sources of energy, however we need to understand that even the production of alternate forms of energy still fits under the con side of the resolution. He doesnt actually defend any of his arguments with the pro side, rather bringing up other examples that still uphold the con."	CON	592
S5ae629e3-A415bb704	Resolved: A just society ought to prioritize environmental concerns over the production of energy.	As a brief road map. I will be attacking the Con, and defending the Pro. Con- Value- First off, we look at my opponent's value of Happiness. Happiness is a very shallow,if not the most shallow value value that could ever be held. It's a fleeting emotion tied from anything and everything from kittens to thermonuclear reactors. In fact it's a value so easily achieved that even if you completely ignore the Con case, and tie the value of Happiness to the Pro case, I achieve it. Second, Happiness is a subsidiary value to Life. A dead man cannot be happy, thus before we ever value happiness we must value life. Finally, a Con vote will neither achieve happiness, nor maximize it. When happiness is contingent on possession, electricity, or oil; it can only last so long as society is satisfied with their electronics. Criterion- My opponent offers the Criterion of energy; however energy is not a criterion, it is not a weighing mechanism. Energy is a means to an end. My opponent's should actually be Cars, Computers, Video Games, and any other product that uses energy. Honestly, who do you know that that has their fun by staring an electric outlet, or a gas pump? The point I want to drive home with this argument is two fold One, the things my opponent is advocating are nothing bu shallow and fleeting pleasures. Two, my opponent has no weighing mechanism to truly achieve happiness. Contention 1- I'm just going to list out a few basic arguments against this contention here. + Citizens have had the option to switch to electric cars for quite a few years now + Oil is not the only power sources, in fact along with the prior mentioned electrical car, there are engines that can run off of sea water[1] Vegetable oil[2] and even human excrement[3]. There are no end to alternative fuel sources that can be supplemented for Gas, Oil and Petroleum needs. + The impact here, is that my opponent has no impact. We as Americans need to abandon our false idea that Oil is the only energy recourse we have. Otherwise not only do we begin to fall prey to valuing such shallow things as happiness, but we destroy our environment needlessly, and rob not only people, but plants and animals of life. Pro Value- My opponent's only attack was that life will always exist, to this I say dinosaurs. That's right, dinosaurs. To say that life will always exist is to ignore the real problem here, that life will only exist if we value it. Also, I extend my attack on my opponent's value, that without life we cannot value happiness. A dead man cannot be happy, he's dead. Also I want to provide two quick clarifications, 1. I'm not valuing just human life, but all life as a whole 2. I realize that death is an inevitable part of life, My goal here is to maximize life, not ensure to everything. Criterion- My opponent's attack here is simply based on him not fully reading, or at least not fully understand, my criterion. The Environmental Wisdom World View, dictates not that all other forms of life are more important that human life, but that all life is sacred, and doesn't belong exclusively to humanity. It claims that resources are not human property, but the shared property of all of nature, and we shouldn't act in a way that selfishly benefits ourselves if it hurts nature. It it only through this criterion that that we not only maximize life, but we also keep ourselves safe from falling into the valuing selfish thing, and even forcing ourselves to believe that they're necessities. Contention 1- I'm going to address each of my opponent's attacks directly Attack 1- My opponent claims that the same technology that has killed all these people, has saved the lives of numerous cancer patients. 35,000 to be exact. However I have several rebuttals to this. First, there are many other cures to cancer that aren't used simply because they cannot be marketed as drugs in the united states.[4] Second millions of people have cancer, and although Chemotherapy is the industry standard millions of people still die every year due to cancer, and failed Chemotherapy. Chemoherapy only has an overall success rate of 2%[5] Attack 2- I expressly spoke of how even today, there are increased levels of thyroid cancer in these areas due to this terrible accident. Attack 3- Here I just want to extend all of the arguments I made on my opponent's Value and Criteria, he never really succeeds in solving for the harms I present here, and instead simply claims that we still have all of this innovative technology that makes up for the environmental damage, and live lost. However as I cannot stress enough, no amount of technology, or fancy toys will ever equate human life. Contention 2- + First my opponent completely disregards my argument here, once I show how this does indeed tie into the resolution, I will have enough impact here alone to win the debate. First, as my opponent said the company made chemicals; many of which where used in energy production. Second, When these people moved onto this land, it cannot be denied that energy was produced here. This coupled with the Pro Value makes for a direct link into the resolution Contention 3- There is absolutely no refutation here. Obviously the people affected by this tragedy do not have happiness, and they've also lost plenty of life in this disaster. I also want to extend the arguments I made on my opponents sole contention, Oil is not the only means to obtain energy, we have plenty of resources, and ingenuity to make up for the what we would lose in oil. Also, I'm advocating for complete removal of oil, at least not immediately. All I'm saying is that this painfully over dependance on oil has ravaged our environment time and time again, and we continue to see it's affect on life, but human and animal life. There are others means to this same end, and this absurd obsession with Oil will only end up destroying humanity I urge an affirmative vote in this debate. = Sources = [1] http://goo.gl...

Yes, it wil take longer, because it's harder for a market of 300 mio + consumers and countless companies to adjust to a new standard. It's bigger, therefore it'll take longer to catch up speed, but the transition will last, whereas gov intervention may not have a lasting effect. Everyone can choose how much he spends on gasoline. Take a look at (http://www.fueleconomy.gov..., Family+Sedans, Large+Sedans, Upscale+Sedans, Luxury+Sedans, Hatchbacks, Coupes, Convertibles, Sports/Sporty+Cars, Station+Wagons&srchtyp=newDslCars) and you'll see that you can get a Volkswagen Passat for 21,000$, less than most pick-ups, running on diesel and thereby only costing you 1,650$ per year (no maintenance, just fuel costs). Or you get a Mitsubishi iMIEV for 23,000$ which only costs 550$ per year in ""fuel"" (http://www.fueleconomy.gov...). Your argument that people can't choose how much to spend on fuel is therefore invalid. Every investor knows that a high return only comes with a high risk, they know those things go together, and you should remember that. They mostly don't even look for low-risk adventures. Yes, only because investors jump on every train doesn't mean whatever they ignore isn't good for the country. And I also admit that investment into alternative fuels is in decline... but my idea is that the R&D became cheaper and that they're now focusing on production, a sector that could cost less over the long term. Electric vehicles are already on the rise with more than 100% growth rates in some years (http://www.zsw-bw.de...) --> USA is the largest player, just as a side-note ;) .

His claim that technology is making them better than nuclear is also invalid and unsourced. The impovements he speaks of that are being done to cars only work due to the fact that the methods employed to run the engines are becoming more efficient. In a fossil plant, all efficiency is determined by the quality of the fuel. His next contention against nuclear power plants is that a safe way to deposit radioactive waste is non-existent. Please read my previous post, as for the notion that earthquakes can break these chambers? Unreasonable. The deposits are built into hard rock in the middle of tectonic plates. Their designers considered just about everything that could go wrong, from terrorist strikes to volcanic activity, these deposits are safe. b) My opponents argument that nuclear power hurts people can be dismissed by the following statistic: for each person killed by nuclear power generation, 4,000 die from coal. [1] So how can you argue that Coal isn't as destructive to human life? c) My opponent claims that the construction costs of a nuclear power plant are rediculously high, and thus we shouldn't build them. The cost of a nuclear power plant is quite expensive during the construction phase but is amazingly cheap in the maintanence and running factor. My opponent curiously forgot to put this fact in. Maybe because it trashes his argument? I think so. After a while of running a nuclear power station, you would save more money than coal plants, and you would save more lives too.

S57476c56-Adbb93fe5	government should intervene in the transition to alternative fuels	another example of why private investors wouldn't invest. because it might be considered a 60 or 70% chance of becoming ht next fuel, but it's still an uncertainty that investors wouldn't want to invest in given the potential bad risks coming to fruition. so we have society notably poor and middle class squandering its wealth until the pockets of the rich are hurt, the driver of change? and this is being allowed when the odds are in that fuels favor, we are just sitting back letting the economy hurt itself? even if i haven't established that those are the odds, doesn't con at least admit that they could be the odds, and government involvement could be the best bet? i dn't argue specific numbers, but i argue it's clear that a fuel will prevail in the end, that is renewable. that means we should be acting to further that change. how we pay for it is a side point to whether we should do it. we can cut other programs to pay for it. i'm sure con wouldn't be opposed to that. the point we're debating it has to do with whether it's the best efficiency or not, the right thing or not assuming we'd take care of the finances behind it. con argues it is unclear whether that catch 22 was clear. no demand cause no infrastruction, no infrastruction cause no demand. that observation is self evident. if there was a demand, investors would invest. but note the issue here. if it was a demand that seemed decently profitable. most companies don't want to because there's too many uncertainties. i've shown that it's certainly possible the economy at large could benefit if we switched sooner, but it's not happening due to self interested investors. so yes, we would be forcing an artificial demand by driving down costs to consumers and suppliers. but that is a good thing, because it will stimulate a change quicker that should come, but is being hampered by a market that doesn't act truly efficiently on its own, here due to self interested investors and a lack of information, or a lack of certitude. the government should roll the dice, to at best catalyze a change that comes to fruition due to the government involvement, or at worst to act as a hedge, to say even if we lost money on the bets we made, we are okay with that. the odds are high enough and clear enough for us to take action sooner than later. we don't have to take taxes from everyone, so if it was merely a tax credit, what is wrong with that? if people are doing things that are potential or actually are beneficial to society, it's entirely fair to not tax them as much. if we don't, then that is government involvement. but also if we accepted doing tax credits, why not spend a little money too? if we allow one we shouldn't be so hesitant about doing the other. sure private investment will be best done when it is using its own money, but there are plenty of incentives to do it right, even when the government is paying some too. such as the potential for profit, and the potential for loss of the private money that the government does use. aa while we can bicker about how high the odds are for a certain fuel, it seems clear that merely not taxing someone as much at the least is something we should do, which is government involvement. we are not bound to tax people so if we choose not to, for legitimate reasons, we are not just doing as we could. con points out that nonrenewables are cheaper. yes, they are, but that doesn't mean we should just allow things to played out as is until that is no longer the case, in a free market way. i'm arguing we internve to increase efficiency, save the classes none y that would be better spent stimulating the economy at large. if we wait till the rich are hurt, the overall economy is hurt for it.

Se6216237-A8ef3211	Resolved: Allowing deep water offshore oil drilling is in the best interest of the United States.	"First i want to say thank you to my opponent for accepting my challenge then i will say Resolved: Allowing deep water offshore oil drilling is in the best interest for the UNITED STATES. Now i will move on to defend my case and attack my opponents in the process. Contention 1. The oil spill was grossly exagguratted. Evidence: www.lewrockwell.com. It now seems that about a third of the oil from the infamous oil spill has already evaporated into the atomosphere where it will have no effect. Furthermore, all of the toxic elements of the oil will soon have evaporated as well. Some globs of oil may wash up to shore, but whatever remains will apparently sink down to the sea floor and just become part of the sediment. Now to go on and attack my opponents part of their case where they say Additionally, while Time may have stated that the spill killed less than 1% of the birds that died because of the Exxon-Valdeez spill, we must keep in mind that the Exxon-Valdeez spill happened over a decade ago, and we are still seeing the effects of it. We would expect that the amount of damage done by the more recent spill would be fractional in comparison to the Exxon spill because that statistic quantifies data collected over years, whereas the Horizon spill happened only months ago. We do need to keep in mind about the spill times however we need to think of how The United States stands to benefit economically from offshore drilling if our judges vote for the con side of the debate then they killing many job opportunities. We feel very bad for those families that lost loved ones due to the BP blow out but we need to think are we going to let them die in vain? Are we going to let the money that were making be blown away? No if we eliminate these jobs were are cripiling our economy! When workers take these jobs THEY decide that having this job is better then having no jobs. Next though I did say cleanup was poorly handled by the government it was to see if they would bite on the bait that i left for them. We need to get people into government positions where they will NOT watch Pornograpgy instead of working. Now this penalizes both parties Pro and Con for it is average everyday people doing this instead of going out there and helping out. Now im going to ask all the judges to look at this ""In regards to the Deepwater Horizon spill, a rig worker noticed a dangerous leak which was reported to BP, which failed to repair it www.businessweek.com). Even the BP employees hired to clean up the spill say they were not wholly informed about the dangers they would face while working on the cleanup"" my opponent says in his case that workers are aware of dangers. Now im going to ask ALL of you out there to tell me what 2+2 equals Lastly i will say directly to my opponent what are the NEW sources of energy to transition to and how much will they cost. How log will it take to instill them in our government? Now also Are we going to REQUIRE all of our construction workers, taxi drivers, power line maintenance crew, farmers, loggers, and fishers to wear chemical and bio suits to make them as safe as can be? I hope that you judges will say we need to change things around and i ask for a Pro ballet in todays debate!!!!! THANK YOU AMERICA"	PRO	744

Under the Non-Pr…	Encouraging the further adoption of nuclear power is against our security interests. The scientific understanding and technology needed to generate nuclear power is the same as that needed to create nuclear weapons, and it is all too easy for rogue states to pretend they are only interested in peaceful uses while secretly pursuing military applications. This is the route India and Israel have followed, and that Iran may well be following at present. Even if the intentions of foreign governments are good, widespread nuclear power plants are at risk of terrorism. This applies just as much in the USA or other western countries as it does in the developing world. If a September 11-style flying bomb was flown into a nuclear power plant, the potential disaster would be catastrophic. And the more nuclear material is transported around the world, the easier it will be for terrorists to get hold of some in order to make their own nuclear weapons. An atomic bomb might one day be within the reach of some international terrorist groups, but even today a simple ‘dirty bomb’ (in which highly-radioactive materials is blasted over an urban area using conventional explosives) could be deadly to many thousands of people.

The cost of building reactors is enormous and the price of subsequently decommissioning them also huge. Without massive government subsidy the nuclear industry cannot make money and building new plants is uneconomic compared to other methods of power generation. Then there is also the problem of waste. Nuclear waste can remain radioactive for thousands of years. It must be stored for all this time away from water into which it can dissolve and far from any tectonic activity. This is virtually impossible and there are serious concerns over the state of waste discarded even a few decades ago. Governments have frequently resorted to dumping waste into the sea; an action which it has been shown has lead to an increase in radioactivity along many coastlines.	CON	750

Under the Non-Proliferation Treaty the declared nuclear weapons states (the USA, UK, Russia, France and China) have promised to assist other countries in gaining access to civilian nuclear power providing that they in turn do not seek nuclear weapons. This has only happened to a limited extent but as an increasing number of countries seek to use nuclear material for military purposes, it is in the interests of the declared nuclear weapons states to uphold their side of the bargain more vigorously, so that others can be held to theirs. This security calculation is strengthened by events since the end of the Cold War. Many former Soviet nuclear scientists lost their jobs and may be tempted to sell their skills to the highest foreign bidder, including to rogue states seeking nuclear weapons.

In response to that although I don't have a background in science, I still think that a hybrid car would be more efficient.Next Please. Water does not burn it is the additives in the hydrogen that burn which would cost much more than the regulation of the gas that is already being produced. Gas additives do not work due to the fact that hydrogen is part water and carbon dioxide. it is the carbons that would be emited into the air not water. Hydrogen would be more expensive to produce than water or gasoline produced today. This would not be cost efficient. To regulate gas would mean bringing down the prices we are paying at the pumps today. The solution to gas burning cars is to look for cost efficient ways to cut down on fuel costs. Next Please.

(though i could see how you'd disagree given the fuel efficiency argument.. but at this point we'd just be bickering and not talking about the government eventually intervening which is the real point) you never responded to the substance of my argument: that having the fuel economy would save us money. i understand that our premises are different, as per your ideas about how much water it takes... but anyway here is where the debate should be headed should you rightfully accept my premises about the cost of alt fuels in those links: if we wait until the richer can feel it, all that money that's being squandered by teh poor and middle class isn't going to the economy at large cause one thing i wasn't very explicit on. if they can make it for a dollar a gallon, and even if they sold it at 2 a gallon, which is what they say they'd be doing, it'd still work out right. consider, that my google search says the average station produces 700000 gallons of fuel a year. if we have a better infrastructure sooner than later, then taken to the extreme that'd be instead of 3*700k it'd be 2*700k, with a 700,000 saving per station. that, in one year, would be more than enough to pay for a machine there. instead, we're waiting till the rich get pinched... we're wasting at most 700000 dollars a year per gas station. i realize dthe numbers are made optimally for me, and there's a trasition period, but. what the free market fundamentalist would say....wait till gas is 12 dollars a gallon... cause that's the only way the rich and the fuel stations are going to start doing anything: they're not going to do it sooner, cause the richer don't want to be inconvenienced by limited stations, and the stations won't do it, cause they have no consumers. and then, if we did it the free mar fun way, we'd have to wait for those new cars to trickle down. not all things... lke that toy you pose as an example... come from the rich... but things like cars, which people notoriously buy used... is completely different, with that example as irrefutable proof. and you never addressed the fact that demand would indeed be created or argued how it wouldn't. you simply asserted that no demand would be created... that it's just reducing corporate costs only.. just an assertion. if someone can get cheaper fuel, the catch 22 no longer exists, and they'd be more willing to go for an alt fuel car. it's really not hard..

Sc67a3d49-Aa62b4510	What is the best alternate transportation fuel to replace gas -? I argue that it is hydrogen.	In response to your previous argument, no you don't know my background . Which has nothing to do with this debate. Although I am not a combustion scientist I am well aware of the gas prices today. This is why I ask you to prove your theory of why we need hydrogen cars as opposed to gas burning ones. I have some knowlege of how a car engine works which gives me some leverage to continue debating this issue. You obviously have not looked at a car enging lately to study how it works, as opposed to someone who is curious about it like me. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to have a curious mind. Now to learn about the thing called a combustion chamber. This is the little chamber that the gas goes to when it enters the tank this then fires off sparks to help make the car go. Although I do not know as much as a scientist might I try to analyze how and what would make a car or other vehicle run. Hydrogen is a molecular structure , made up and split from different structures. This would be a more expensive source of fuel to use in our vehicles, looking for other sources of fuel would not be the solution for our problem with oil and gas. We should regulate gas so that we can put a seal on how much our gas costs,by doing this we can look to renewable resources, we can convert our recycleables into oil which would cut down on fuel costs, because we would not have to rely on overseas oil as much as we do now.Plus we have alot of oil off the coast of the United States that we have never drilled. Scientists and chemists are not automechanics, so your theory about this is unfounded please back up this arguement, because this sounds like nonsense. Please read Automechanics 101 to find out what makes the engine of the car go. You will find this book in the local library this will blow your mind. You in the last 2 rounds of this debate you have not proven why we should use hydrogen instead of gas in our cars. In response to you personally attacking me and my character I do not appreciate it ,Also I will not dignify those with a demeaning or malicious statement I am only directing the arguements to the debate at hand not at you in any personal way,as you have done to me.

Sc67a3d49-A66eb3879	What is the best alternate transportation fuel to replace gas -? I argue that it is hydrogen.	In response to your challenge, I find that maybe using alcohol might be better due to the fact that we need a cleaner way to fuel our cars. As you are probably aware we already have hybrid cars which run on battery or gas in the vehicle. Hydrogen although part water is an ok idea in theory this burns faster than gas would and emit more hydrocarbons into the air we breathe.	CON	802
