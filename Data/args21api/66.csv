S756139ed-A5d774807	Heaven and Hell are real.	"Well, I would like to start by saying that although I do personally believe that there is a hell and that there is a God, I will make sure that the evidence I provide will be as professional as possible. Some might come with points of ""science"". I will define that, as well as other key terms in this debate. Define Hell: a nether world in which the dead continue to exist : hades (2) : the nether realm of the devil and the demons in which the damned suffer everlasting punishment ""often used in curses or as a generalized term of abuse http://www.merriam-webster.com... Define Heaven: a often capitalized : The dwelling place of the Deity and the blessed dead. A spiritual state of everlasting communion with God. http://www.merriam-webster.com... Define real: Actually existing or happening : not imaginary. Not fake, false, or artificial http://www.merriam-webster.com... Define Science: knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation http://www.merriam-webster.com... Now that I have defined key terms in this debate, I would first like to claim that Heaven and Hell are real places, and just because there are no recorded ""facts learned through experiments and observations"" by prestigious philosophers and scientists, doesn't mean its imaginary."

Sf9a84307-Ac35a1f4a	Hell is a real place	"Before I begin the debate, I would like to thank Kyle for accepting the challenge and wish him the best. Also, let it be known that all of the verses listed will be from the King James Version of the Bible. God bless and let the debate begin! :-) --------------------------------------------------------- Jesus talks about hell in Mark 9:43-48 Mark 9:43-48 reads, ""And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" Jesus specifically says ""having two feet to be cast into hell"". This part of the verse here proves that hell is indeed an actual place. In addition to proving that hell is a real place, this verse also shows that despite what many people believe, Jesus was not always ""meek and gentle"". He was serious and stern at times such as this. Hell is mentioned in Luke 16:23 Luke 16:23, reads, ""And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom"". This verse also mentions ""in hell"", indicating that hell is a real place. A personal account A man by the name of Bryan Melvin, claims to have gone to hell and back. Considering he was an athiest prior to his experience, this is pretty strong evidence. [1] Sources: [1]"	PRO	2

S756139ed-A427cbebf	Heaven and Hell are real.	I accept, but bear in mind that the burden of proof is entirely on you. You are the one making a claim about the world. I, on the other hand, am taking the position that I do not know if there is a Heaven or a Hell. I believe that they are made up and can give arguments to that effect, but those are not proof and I have no intention of postulating those arguments here. All I am going to do is show that you have no justification for an assertion that Heaven and Hell are real. I will say one more thing here. If you have no rational justification for a thing, then the rational position is not to assert that it either is or is not true. Now, for some things it is good to act as if it is real, for example free will. I can't say for sure that I have it, but if I do I will use it to do the most good I can(which by the way, your God doesn't give half a monkey's butt about, all he cares about is people being gullible enough to worship him without evidence and to Hell, literally, with anyone who is a skeptic) TL;DR BOP is on PRO All I will do is refute any argument he makes.

Sf9a84307-A106fe489	Hell is a real place	"The Bible version quoted from and referred to in my argument will always be the King James Version. The meaning and use of the Hebrew and Greek words for hell, as it is found in the Bible, are theologically contested and perpetually controversial. So, instead of employing original definitions which can easily be challenged from many different sources, I shall endeavor to apply logic and reason, using only the Bible as a reference in round two. However, I may employ other sources and definitions for the rebuttal in round three. To say that hell is not a place is, admittedly, not entirely accurate. When one is suffering, whatever location that person is in while they suffer, could, in fact, be called hell. But for someone else in the same location, who is not suffering, hell would be an unlikely epithet. For this reason, it is safe to say that ""hell"" is a relative term. For instance, for an abused slave, a plantation would have been hell. But for the plantation owner, who made a great deal of money from unpaid labor, aside from paying foremen, and providing the essentials, it was very likely a heaven. So it is fair to say that the plantation itself was not hell, but the conditions suffered by the abused slaves was indeed hell. As such, in this instance, hell is a condition, not a place, even when the place might be called hell. Continuing to apply that logic, no one would argue that war is hell, wherever that war might be raging. Torture is hell, wherever that torture may be inflicted. Regardless of the location, I believe it is safe to say that the victims of war and torture would say that they were in hell. In fact it is common knowledge that many victims of war and torture have been quoted as having ""been in hell"", or ""already having done there time in hell."" Now that I have established that the word ""hell"", outside of the Bible, is not restricted to any particular place, or even recognized as a place, I will show that the same logic can be applied to the word ""hell"" as it is found in the Bible. Looking at Jonah 2:2 which reads, ""And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice."" The ""belly of hell"" Jonah speaks of is inside a fish. Just like all other instances of the word ""hell"" in the Old Testament, the word ""hell"" in this verse is the Hebrew sheol. The fact that another Hebrew word is not used to differentiate from all the other instances of sheol that are translated, ""hell"", offers a very convincing argument that the Hebrew sheol does not necessarily indicate a place, but can certainly mean a condition. Because it is undeniably obvious that the ""belly of hell"" Jonah speaks of is not one that has a lake of fire, or any other definition usually assigned to the Hebrew sheol. Jonah isn't very happy in the fish's belly. So we see that in this biblical passage, ""hell"" is a condition, not a place. Otherwise, we would have to be contradictory and say that ""hell"" is not a lake of fire, but the belly of a fish. Since this instance of ""hell"" is clearly a condition, then it is not unreasonable to believe that other, or even all, instances of ""hell"" in the Bible are a condition, not a place. We know from the Bible that not all suffering will be the same. In Matthew 23:14, Christ tells the scribes and Pharisees that they shall receive the ""greater damnation"". It stands to reason if there is a ""greater damnation"" or greater punishment, then there must be a lesser punishment. However, there can be no greater or lesser punishment if all the bad boys and girls are tossed into the same lake of fire, where they would all suffer the same punishment. Of course it can be argued that God can make this lake of fire worse than that lake of fire, but there is no biblical support of varying lakes of fire, so it would be an empty argument. Another instance of varying degrees of suffering is found in Matthew 11:22, where Christ says that it will be more tolerable for one type of sinner than for another. Clearly not all sinners will suffer the same punishment. Each person will receive a degree of punishment to match their degree of sin. This cannot be done if they are all tossed into the same eternal lake of fire from which they will never escape. It is reasonable to believe that the lake of fire (and brimstone) is an allegory of the condition of suffering, or ""hell"" that sinners will be thrust into. A ""hell"" they will endure until they have paid the uttermost farthing. (Matthew 5:26) Further evidence that ""lake of fire"" is allegorical can be seen in James 3:6, where the tongue is a fire. And yet, people do not commonly have fire on their tongue. ""Lake of fire"" is an allegory for the suffering of a life that defiles, just as ""tongue is a fire"" is an allegory for words that defile. I have sufficiently shown that it is unreasonable to believe that God has created a lake of fire where sinners will burn eternally. Further logic shows that God would not create such a place. Again and again, the Bible tells of a ""just God"". Where is the justice of having people endure a lake of eternal fire forever for the sins of a short life time? Even David says that God will not leave his soul in hell. (Acts 2:27) He will suffer hell until he has paid the uttermost farthing, then he, like all other sinners, will receive a just judgment (Revelations 20:13-14), and will be placed in one of God's many mansions. (John 14:2) There is, of course, the argument that the Bible clearly tells us that there will be no end to the sinner's suffering. In light of what I have presented, it should be clear that the sinners cannot end their suffering. For them, it seems to have no end. Only God can end their suffering, and even then, it will continue forever as regret, because they will receive a lesser eternal reward than the more righteous. Or, perhaps, no reward at all. Finally, though this is admittedly superficial at best, it should be noted that ""hell"" is recognized as a pronoun in the Bible only once. Cities, like Jerusalem, are always capitalized, but not ""hell"". One might argue that ""hell"" should be capitalized, but erroneously was not in the King James Version, or that it need not be capitalized because it is not an established location. However, the ""not an established location"" excuse fails, because ""Zion"" and its transliterate ""Sion"" in the New Testament, is consistently capitalized despite not being an established location. The word ""hell"" is found in the King James Version 54 times. 5 of those times it is capitalized. 4 times because it begins a sentence, and once because Hell is made an entity along with Death, riding on a pale horse. The other 49 times, it is written with the lower case ""h"". Why? Could it be that the translators of the English Bible interpreted ""hell"" as not a place, but as a condition, and therefore made it a lower case noun, and not a capitalized pronoun? From what I have presented, I would have to say that it makes sense. I believe by using only the Bible that I have shown sufficiently well that ""hell"" is a condition, and not a place."	CON	6
Sf9a84307-A7b0496f7	Hell is a real place	"I would like to thank my opponent for the civility demonstrated thus far in this debate. Mark 9:43-48 must be read allegorically, else we must believe that there will be many people in heaven who will be crippled for all eternity. In which case, it could hardly be called heaven. To cut off a hand or a foot, or to pluck out an eye actually means to separate oneself from that which might morally weaken them. Christ is not telling us to literally maim ourselves, because removing an appendage or eye would not solve the offensive problem, because the appendages and the eye are controlled by the conscience, heart, and mind. To effectively remove the offense from ourselves by removing body parts would require removing our brain or heart and taking our own lives. In 2 Peter 2:14 we read: Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: Here we see that it is not the ""eyes"" that are the problem, but the ""heart"" that is the problem. And what good would it do to just pluck out one eye, when it is both eyes that are full of the offense. Again, Christ is not telling us to literally pluck out our eye. This is further supported in Matthew 15:19 where we are told that evil thoughts come from the heart. So why were we not told to pluck out our heart instead of our eyes? The obvious answer is that Christ has chosen a graphic allegory to warn us to separate ourselves from even that which we hold dear to avoid hell. A scripture that supports that fact is Matthew 10:37, where we are told to be more dedicated to Christ than our own family. Now that I have shown that the passages should be read allegorically, it logically follows that ""hell"" in these passages is also allegorical for suffering, and not a real place. The original Greek word for ""hell"" in these passages is Gehenna, which is the Valley of Hinnom, located outside Jerusalem, where fires were kept burning perpetually for trash and the carcasses of animals, and even criminals. Christ was using a dismal place familiar to the people to give them an idea of the agony they might suffer. He wasn't speaking of an actual ""hell fire"". A passage that supports this logic can be found at the very end of the Book of Isaiah, where it speaks of the unquenchable fire, and the undying worm. Not in hell, but on the carcasses of the wicked, as they are seen here on Earth, not in hell. Luke 16:23 explains itself: ""...in hell ... being in torments..."" The man is suffering the agony of hell, not in a place called hell. The man ""lifted"" his eyes, because even allegorically, no one looks ""down"" from hell. The man also sees Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. If we were to take the entire passage literally, then all souls that have been saved can expect to be in Abraham's bosom. That'll be a bit rough on poor Abraham. Elaborating a bit further. ""In hell"" does not have to literally mean in an actual hell anymore than being ""down in the dumps"" would literally mean being in a dump somewhere. ""In hell"" simply means ""in agony."" As for the video. At first I wasn't going to watch it, but I did anyway. The link only took me to the first part, so I found the entire video here: https://youtu.be... I found the man's story to be completely fictitious for the following reasons: 1:45 into the video, the man speaks of a ""black, dark void"". Then 2:19 into the video, he's suddenly transported to ""this light"". At no point does he does he tell us when he noticed the light, it just suddenly finds place in his narrative, where it becomes a light in the darkness. Of course, such details can be overlooked in the retelling, but I have a hard time believing that would be the case here, considering how detailed the rest of his narrative is for such an alleged traumatic event. 13:46 into the video, he mentions little reptilian demons who delight in torturing a man. No such entity is described anywhere in the Bible, but can instead be found in many horror stories. The other problem with the little demons is that they delight in doing what Christ often describes as evil. So, in a sense, what is hell for everyone else, is heaven for them. This means that God is rewarding evil doers, which would mean that He is not the same yesterday, today, and forever, which in turn means he is not God, which in turn means there is no heaven or hell. The man's little demons contradict religious belief. 14:13 into the video, the man mentions a temple prostitute who died in 69 A.D. How does he know that? Well, 15:05 into the video, he states that he ""just knows"", despite having to be told everything telepathically earlier. 17:11 into the video, the man sees who he knows for a fact is Hitler. He describes a man whose flesh is constantly rotting and burning. So, how was he able to recognize a face that is always marred by burning, rotting flesh? Oh, that's right, he just knows. At the end of the video, the man is shown a cube, because cubes are the prison everyone in hell is kept in, save for a few tortured souls he saw on his tour of hell. Yes, a reptilian demon, larger than the others that were described, takes him on a pleasant tour of hell. I say pleasant, because despite standing near a man being ripped to pieces by little demons, he is left completely unharmed. Yeah, right. Even if any of this man's story made sense, or failed to be contradictory to religious belief, it is entirely based on hearsay. As my opponent so correctly wrote, the man ""claims"" to have gone to hell and back. Sorry, but there's only one Audie Murphy."	CON	7

Sf9a84307-Abd6ae532	Hell is a real place	"Before I begin, I would like to thank my opponent for submitting his first argument. I will attempt to address all of the arguments made by him. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rebuttal: The Bible doesn't capitalize ""Hell""; therefore, it's not a place While this is admittedly a convincing argument, it still doesn't disprove the existence of Hell. The Bible specifically states that Hell is a ""lake of fire and brimstone"" (Rev. 21:8). When the Bible mentions ""hell"" in lowercase it is most likely, as my opponent states, a state of being. However, this doesn't prove that there is not a place called Hell where the unforgiven go. Rebuttal: James 3:6 comparison My opponent claims that because the tongue is compared to fire in James 3:6 that the ""lake of fire"" must be symbolic; however, this is simply not true. In other versions of the Bible, such as the New International Version (NIV) Revelation 21:8 is translated to include the ""lake of burning sulphur"". Now, where in the Bible does it symbolically compare something to burning sulphur? Rebuttal: Varying degrees of suffering I completely agree with my opponent on this one. This debate is not about whether or not certain people suffer more than others. As my opponent puts it, ""there is no biblical support of varying lakes of fire"". I completely agree with this, but there is a theory that can be applied to these circumstances. Perhaps God enables some to suffer more in the lake and others to suffer less. Rebuttal: The ""just God"" argument My opponent argues that a just and righteous God would not enable a person to suffer eternily. However, this is his opinion and only his. Many others believe it is fair for certain people to suffer eternily. Those who commit heinous acts such as murderers and rapists do deserve punishment. My opponent also argues that God will not leave a soul in hell. Acts 2:27 was taken out of context by my opponent. Acts 2:27 refers to Jesus's forgiveness so we can have eternal life, not that He pardons all from punishment."	PRO	10

""How can you say burning someone alive forever is ""just"" or ""fair"" for everyone who hasn't accepted Jesus Christ? Even we humans fit the punishment to the crime. According to you, Christians, people are destined to be burned in Hell whether we are bad or not. Just being born into this world is grounds for being endlessly tortured.

""Infinite punishment for finite crimes just doesn't seem just."" ""I could never torture people endlessly, especially my own children. How can you say that God will do that to His children? This seems hideous. You make God look like a monster worse than Hitler, not a loving Father Who would even die for His enemies!"" ""If the wages of sin is eternal punishment in Hell, then Jesus would have to be eternally punished if in fact He died for my sins. But the Bible says the wages of sin is death which is exactly what Jesus did--died. So how can you say people will be eternally tortured in Hell? Is Jesus presently being eternally tortured in place of those who accepted Him as Lord?"" (Source: http://tentmaker.org...) ---- These are very good, logical questions which I find hard, if not impossible to answer. More questions about the rationality of the concept of Hell. ---- • If Hell as a place of everlasting tortures was the real fate of all mankind unless they did something here on earth to prevent it, why didn't God make that warning plain right at the beginning of the Bible? God said the penalty for eating of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was DEATH. He did NOT define death as eternal life being forever tortured in burning fire and brimstone. • If Hell was real why didn't Moses warn about this fate in the Ten Commandments or the Mosaic Covenant consisting of over 600 laws, ordinances, and warnings? The Mosaic Law simply stated blessings and cursings IN THIS LIFETIME for failure to keep the Mosaic Law. • If Hell is real and it is a place of eternally being separated from God, why does David say in the King James Bible, ""Though I make my bed in Hell (Sheol) lo, Thou art there? (Again please note, most Christian Bibles NO LONGER have the word ""Hell"" in the Old Testament. The KJV written over 350 years ago is an exception. The Jews do NOT put the word ""Hell"" in their English translations of the Hebrew Scriptures, that is, the Old Testament and the leading English Christian Bibles have removed it because it is NOT in the originals. • If Hell is real and if good people go to heaven and bad people go to Hell, why does EVERYONE, good or bad, go to the same place in the Old Testament? They ALL go to Sheol which the King James Version translated ""Hell"" thirty-0ne times, ""grave"" thirty-one times and ""pit"" three times? Are we all destined to go to Hell or did the King's translators make some gross translation errors? • If Hell was real, why did Church leaders as late as the fourth century AD acknowledge that the majority of Christians believed in the salvation of all mankind? (Ref, #1) • If Hell doesn't exist in the Old Testament, how could Jesus and his disciples teach that salvation was deliverance from a place that is not even found in their Scriptures? (There was only the Old Testament at that time.) Would that not make Him appear like a false teacher? • If Hell was real, why did the first comparatively complete systematic statement of Christian doctrine ever given to the world by Clement of Alexandria, A.D. 180, contain the tenet of universal salvation? (Ref. #1) ---- [quote]This passage explains that God has the power to through us into Hell. He might not send people there, but it does exist.[/quote] If you believe in hell, you have to believe that those who do not believe in the Christian God will be sent there. ---- ""If you are a Christian that believes that the Bible is truth than you have to believe that there is a hell. Why, Luke 12:4-5 says ""I tell you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has the power to through you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him."" Okay, let me make a hypothesis.

It is a lake of fire that has different qualities depending on which text you read. All of these qualities vary from a metaphorical standpoint and each persons mind. So hell is essentially a punishment God would invoke on us for not accepting him, but it could be any possible punishment which the likelihood of it being the lake of fire. After reading down my adversary just literally type out my entire point for me and conceded to it. "" The Hell that I am arguing about is not tangible to the human body but the human soul. There could not be an infinite number of possible hells because we don't have an infinite choice because the idea of Hell is one idea and thus although there could be many possible Hells, it could not go forever because what we have and what we live in is limited in ideas, i.e. : There would have to be some possible idea to go with Hell in the whole Universe. So that is what I mean by Hell"" This is basically asserting my point. If there is any possible number of hells, we could possibly go there. We do not have to for certain go there, but if there lies a possibility that we could my adversary has not fulfilled his bop See my C4 in R2 If any possibility exists of hell being real, he loses this debate. For him to uphold the resolution, he must show there is no possible way or not possibility of hell existing which cannot be done. R3) Loving God no hell Essentially this is easily refuted. He said if Gods loves us why would he send us to hell. Even by acknowledging a God we are acknowledging the fact he lets us go to hell. God by definition is omnipotent. So by my adversary conceding there is a God he is conceding the fact that God knows everything. That is whom will love him and whom does not. So that answers his own question for him. When God created us and knew some of us would worship him and some would not The essential premise is the subjectivity of justice. Justice to God is different than justice to us or would be different than the justice that we perceive. [P1] Justice varies/is subjective in every possible God [P2] God is a possible mind [P3] His definition of justice is subjective. Hell is any possible punishment for now choosing to worship him after he created us. He can still love us and punish us. That is a fact. Conclusion Again my adversary dropped almost all of my contentions and especially he possibility arguments which is the crux of this debate For him to when he has to show there is no possible way for hell to exists.

As it says in John 3:16: ""For God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son and whoever believes in him shall never die but have eternal life."" So the requirements for entering Heaven is not walking the straight and narrow: It's a belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God. Opponent: ""Infinite punishment for finite crimes just doesn't seem just."" I would like to disagree. We all know we only have so much time on this Earth.

How can you say that God will do that to His children? This seems hideous. You make God look like a monster worse than Hitler, not a loving Father Who would even die for His enemies!"" God is a loving God. However, he is also a just God. There are several examples of this in scripture. The first is the story of Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve did something they were told they couldn't do. Therefore, they were kicked out of Eden. So this proves that God is a just God. I believe that God is just as human as the rest of us and he gets angry, sad, happy, etc. That's like your mother doesn't love you because she's grounded you a couple of times.

Is Jesus presently being eternally tortured in place of those who accepted Him as Lord? No, first of all Jesus was only dead for three days. He was resurrected and 40 days later ascended to HEAVEN. A first grade Sunday school class could tell you that... And secondly, when the Bible says the wages of sin is death. It's not talking about physical death, it is talking about going to Hell. Opponent: If Hell as a place of everlasting tortures was the real fate of all mankind unless they did something here on earth to prevent it, why didn't God make that warning plain right at the beginning of the Bible? Why didn't he tell Adam and Eve that? Because he didn't know if they would eat from the tree of good and evil. Opponent: ""If Hell is real and it is a place of eternally being separated from God, why does David say in the King James Bible, ""Though I make my bed in Hell (Sheol) lo, Thou art there?"" That was the OLD testament. The NEW testament (which is the basis of Christianity, and aren't we debating about Christian Hell; not Jewish Hell) makes several references to Heaven and Hell. And I thought you were trying to prove that Hell doesn't exist, well you just contradicted yourself. And I believe that when Christ returns a 2nd time, those who died before his death will be able to ascend to Heaven. Opponent: ""If Hell is real and if good people go to heaven and bad people go to Hell, why does EVERYONE, good or bad, go to the same place in the Old Testament?"" Because it's the Old Testament. That is Judaism, we're in the NEW testament, which is Christianity. I thought we were debating about CHRISTIAN hell; at least that is what you said. And I believe in the Old Testament God was still angry at the world because of Adam and Eve. Opponent: ""If Hell was real, why did Church leaders as late as the fourth century AD acknowledge that the majority of Christians believed in the salvation of all mankind?"" Christians are people. People don't always get everything right. Opponent: If Hell doesn't exist in the Old Testament, how could Jesus and his disciples teach that salvation was deliverance from a place that is not even found in their Scriptures? Jesus never spoke of deliverance from Hell. He spoke of deliverance from Evil. Opponent: Okay, let me make a hypothesis. Maybe this was added to the Bible later or it was a mistake in translation (the meaning of the word Gehenna [used in the passage] is debatable). There happens to be the valley of Gehenna (or something like it.) Since you have no proof that it was mistranslated, I would have faith in the Bible and believe that that scripture is true."	CON	16
Sbca005f2-Ac8e59912	there is no such thing as hell.	In the context of the media, hell is often perceived as a place of fire and brimstone. The reality is much worse. The Abyss is real. In that awful place resides horrors unspeakable, and is the grimmest of punishments. But who are the ones being punished? As humans, we all have a choice between right and wrong. Everyday we make choices, some of em good, some of them bad. It would be fool pushed to think bad deeds go unpunished. Yes, there is the courts and legal system, but they are run by sinful people aswell. No one is without sin. Therefore no none can escape judgement. Hell is real in the same way as Heaven is. Hell is the reside of satan and his Angels, punished for their sins. Hell is the great punishment. Without punishment, there will be no reward. Death is the great equaliser, and no one is able to cheat death.	CON	17

S776b55ae-A81a1d3ff	There is no hell	"Thank you for your response. I read that you were Agnostic before, but you are right to say that in this debate it is irrelevant, and that is what I say as well. Point 1. You suggest that I will have to prove that there is such a thing as God, so it does not matter what angle you debate from because you are saying (in the debate) that God exists. When saying that I have to prove that God exists because it is not your burden of proof, it is completely your burden of proof by saying that you will debate as if God exists as well as it is mine. Point 2. I have heard by information on these religious experiences from other sources, sources that you might not find on the Internet, but I can almost guarantee that you will find some experiences like that on the Internet, and if you wish me to, I will find some source or sources. Point 3. How can Hell be real or metaphorical, I fail to see. One type of Hell could be a metaphor for any punishment that God gives us but by Hell I mean punishment given by God. The idea that God sends people to: e.g. (not necessarily a real idea) A tower of thorns. If this is a metaphor, then it is obviously not a real Hell. By saying that there is no Hell, I mean that there is no real Hell that a loving creator would send us to (a punishment). Point 4. I am afraid that, I worded my point wrong. I meant to say that there would have to be a reason associated with everything in the universe for it to be possibly infinitive. Also, if you use the example of the Big Bang, you can not suggest that there is such a thing as infinity because the Universe is said in one of the Big Bang theories, to be expanding and thus there is no infinity. You could I suppose argue using another idea that the Big Bang happened and moved on to infinity and is not still expanding but you would still remain wrong for you are suggesting that there could be infinitive reasons but how could they, because with reasons themselves, they would have to be associated with everything in your supposedly infinitive Universe, and you will have to prove how is that. Also by Hell I mean that there is no possible punishment that God intetionaly gives us, I do not mean any specific Hell, I mean any punishment given by God. Point 5. I do not mean that God has all the power there is known to us, otherwise why would he not destroy all sin and make sure that there is no opposite to him? Thus God can not necessarily foretell what will happen to us and even if he could, it is still not our fault that we have sinned because we only sin because of the opposite to God. If we are creation of God then we (mainly) would think like him and so how would justice as we know it be any different to the way that God (our creator) knows it. Point 6. If you are arguing, saying (in the debate) that God exists and have not yet proved that God is not a loving creator, I do not have to prove that there is not a Hell without the proof that I have not already given, so it is you who has the burden of proving against me. So I will just go over the proof that I have already given: a) God created us and so we cannot choose against him unless the Devil got into us b) It is either God or the opposite who is making us do the things that we do c) Humans are not powerful enough to choose unless there was a neutral force but how will there be able to be one, because is it not the Devil who makes do evil and if we are all Gods creation, why with this neutral force (if there is one) would we choose against God So you will have the burden of proving how that is incorrect. If that is all correct, then how is there Hell? We know justice because God created it and thus it is God whom sees justice the same way that we do. By justice I mean dealing with sinners and not punishing them, that is true justice. Your Point about God loving us and also punish us is incorrect. I will prove it here: 1 God's love to us makes us happy 2 If God punishes us and makes us sad If God loves us then why would he make us sad. We also associate God with kindness and if he is kindness, then why would he punish us. God is loving and he is not just love but also kindness. A God however that loves us, would not punish us if upsetting is a force of evil (Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin and Vlad the Impaler were upsetting people and that was not a thing of God to do) so upsetting is against God, and the fact that it is a punishment does not make it moral for Joseph Stalin and Mao could say correctly that they were punishing those who apposed them and surely that was not a thing of God to do. They might just be fighting back but if it was a punishment, surely you cannot say that it was not a moral thing to do. So if it is God, then God cannot punish and also love. Now I will just go through certain remarks you mad throughout the debate: 1. You suggest that when I said that Hell is tangible to the human soul and not the body you suggested (along with the reasons that I meant that was suggesting that the possible types of Hell could not be infinite) was what you were saying which is not the case because you stated the following: That I said that Hell is not tandgebal You may have meant that it is not tangible to the human body but to the soul is what I said but it did not look like that. 2. ""Most people can only logically assume that Hell is not possible"" that is probably right but from the evidence that I have given, that is more than assuming on my part and I am not debating on possibility or probability, but on fact if God exists and is a loving creator. These are my main points given and please tell me if I have missed anything or not explained something in such a way that you would understand. Thank you for replying and have a Good day :).

Sf9a84307-A74819a6d	Hell is a real place	"For whatever reason, my opponent has forfeited the final round. I shall nevertheless fulfill the debate's requirements set by my opponent, and complete the final round. I shall first endeavor to show I provided a better argument by defending it against my opponents rebuttal. My opponent stated that my comparing the allegory of a ""tongue of fire"" to ""lake of fire"" to show that it is also allegory was trumped by the fact that Revelations mentions a lake of fire and brimstone (sulfur), for which there is no allegorical or symbolic comparison. I would like to show my opponent and the readers that such a comparison in fact exists in Isaiah 30:33, which reads in part, ...the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. I believe we can safely say that hell is not in the Lord's mouth, so that should answer the question: ""Now, where in the Bible does it symbolically compare something to burning sulfur?"" I stated the lack of scriptural evidence and logic in ""varying lakes of fire"". My opponent agreed with the premise, but disagreed with the logic, stating: ""but there is a theory that can be applied to these circumstances."" But my opponent did not offer any kind of theory. Instead, he offered a personal guess with nothing to support it biblically. My opponent was unable to defeat the logic. My opponent states that it is purely my opinion that God would not allow someone to burn and be eaten by worms for all eternity. First, I believe I have sufficiently shown that such a place does not exist. Second, Revelations 20:13 provides proof that it is not my opinion, but fact. All will be judged after they suffer hell, and then ""assigned"" to his or her appropriate place, where they will suffer only regret for not having attained a better place. My opponent accused me of taking a passage out of context, but then failed to place that passage in context, instead providing only his own personal interpretation of said passage. On the other hand, my opponent used a number of passages out of context, and I provided additional passages to place many of them in context. Aside from defending my argument against rebuttal, it would be vain to boast a better argument when that is ultimately for the readers and any potential voters to decide. Suffice it to say, I believe I have presented a logical, well supported argument against a ""lake of fire"", where dead sinners will suffer for ever and ever, being an actual place of existence."

"======= Resolution ======= The images of hell are metaphors pointing to a real, but indefinable state. 1 ======== Clarification ======== The debate will be about the nature of hell. That is from two main differing perspectives, namely, the metaphor view vs the literal view. Both views agree that God (Christian Faith) is not pleased with disobedience and has appointed a day to judge the peoples of the world. 2 There are also other points of agreement such as, the intermediate state (Hades/Paradise or Abraham's Bosom), the destiny of the body (the grave), the bodily resurrections of the believer and the unrighteous, and the eternal destinies (Unbeliever's final destiny: Gehenna: ""Lake of Fire"" and Believer's final destiny ""Heaven""). 3 The sharp disagreement between the views comes down to the interpretation of the language that the authors of the Bible used when describing the nature of hell. Definitions are provided, especially on the word ""hell"" since some translations of the Bible use the word hell to mean: ""Hades"", ""Gehenna"", ""Tartarus"" and ""The Grave"".

Se4a83ec6-A7845a5f8	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"I will make an opening argument, then I will respond to his objections. I think if we examine the Scriptures, then we will see that Hell is, indeed, an actual place where the condemned go when they die. Jesus taught that Hell was a real place. Jesus, Himself, taught that Hell was a real place. In fact, Jesus had more to say about Hell than He did about Heaven. Jesus warned, ""Don't be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell."" (Matt. 10:28). He also said those who reject him would be pulled up and burned in the fire at the end of the age (Matt. 13:40). In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus said that at the final judgement God will say to ""those on his left"" to depart into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). Of the seriousness of Hell, Jesus warned it would be better to cut off an extremity than to allow it to cause you to sin (Mark 9:43). In Luke 16, Jesus also tells a story of Lazarus and the rich man. In it, the rich man dies and is in Hell, a place of torment. There is no doubt Jesus considered Hell a real place of torment. The Bible teaches that Hell is a real place. In Revelation 20:11-15, John offers a very graphic affirmation of the existence of Hell: ""Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."" The Apostle Paul spoke of everlasting separation from God (2 Thess. 1:7-9). I will now respond to Pro's objections. Proportionality Pro actually lays out a great case for why some are damned to Hell for eternity. It is our sin which condemns us. God is eternally holy, and cannot tolerate the presence of sin. He can't even look upon sin (Hab. 1:13). This is why as long as God lasts, Hell lasts. God can't even be in the presence of sin, so if there are those who do not repent of their sins and allow God to forgive their sins, then they are condemned to Hell. Pro says that ""obviously God's justice doesn't require him to damn some,"" but Pro is simply begging the question. First, he is assigned the human concept of judgement and punishment to God. Second, how can he know that God's justice ""obviously"" doesn't require him to damn some? If God exists, it is entirely possible that His concept of justice and punishment is different from ours. But even so, I don't believe it is altogether different. For example, if the crime is heinous enough, we lock people away for the rest of their lives. If no God existed, this would essentially be like Hell -- they would be locked up, their freedom taken away, essentially forever. Of course they wouldn't be punished the entire time they were in there, but it is at least analogous to one aspect of Hell -- separation from God (in this case, society) for eternity. For the record, I don't believe in universalism. I believe there are those who go to Hell. I also believe that we have free will. I have known people who freely choose Hell over having the submit themselves to God, and there are those who freely sin, usually knowing that what they do is wrong. If you don't have a God to answer to, then there's really no reason to do good unless you're afraid of retribution from human authorities. Saying that the reality of Hell doesn't match the crime is really to misunderstand, or at least severely underestimate, the heinousness of sin. First, there is no such thing as a truly good person. As Jonathan Edwards has pointed out, even one sin deserves hell, since the eternal, holy God cannot tolerate any sin. Each person commits a multitude of sins in thought, word, and deed. This is all compounded by the fact that we reject God's immense mercy. And add to this man's readiness to find fault with God's justice and mercy, and we have abundant evidence of the need for hell. If we had a true spiritual aweareness, we would not be amazed at hell's severity but at our own depravity. [1] Justice demands Hell, and God is just (Romans 2). In fact, the very reason that the wicked prosper in this life shows that not all justice is accomplished in this life (Psalm 73:3). Surely, there would be no real justice were there no place of punishment for the demented souls of Stalin and Hitler, who initiated the merciless slaughter of multimillions. God's justice demands that there is a hell. Does Pro believe that Hitler or Stalin deserve to be in Heaven, even with a merely finite punishment? There are only two places one can go. God has offered us salvation. But if you love sin more than you love God, then there is only one place you will end up. In one of his works of fiction, C.S. Lewis describes a busload of people from Hell on the outskirts of Heaven. There they are urged to leave behind the sins that have trapped them in hell, but they refuse. Lewis' descriptions are striking because we recognize in them the self-delusion and self-absorption that are ""writ small"" in our own delusions. [2] C. S. Lewis has also made the following observation: ""There are only two kinds of people -- those who say ""Thy will be done"" to God or those to whom in the end God says, ""Thy will be done."" All that are in Hell choose it. Without that self-choice it wouldn't be Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will miss it."" [3] The Bliss of the Saved I find it interesting that Pro mentions the concept of love means that we care about what is in the others' best interests or overall well-being. Could we really allow Hitler into Heaven, knowing that he hated Jews so much that he killed millions of them in the Holocaust? It seems to me that allowing souls to remain in Hell for eternity would be in the best interest of certain people who are living forever in Heaven. One thing to remember is that, as we see in the verse Pro quoted, God is love. God is perfectly happy in Heaven, knowing that creatures that He created and loved enough to die for them while they hated Him will be in Hell for eternity. It is not a stretch to suppose that we will be able to live in bliss in Heaven despite the fact that people we knew here are in Hell. Certainly it's nothing to rejoice in or find comfort in. A Christian theologian notes: ""What is more, if we could not be happy in Heaven knowing anyone was in Hell, then our happiness is not in our hands but someone else's. But Hell cannot veto Heaven. We can be happy in heaven the same way we can be happy eating knowing others are starving, if we have tried to feed them but they have refused the food. Just as we can have healing of bad memories here on earth, even so God will 'wipe away all tears' in Heaven (Rev. 21:4).""

S776b55ae-A1514bad0	There is no hell	"Resolution - There is no hell A affirmative statement like that could be stated in almost any regard ""There is not God"" ""There is no hell"" ""Zeus does not exist"" The issue is that you need objective evidence to make a claim like that, not circumstantial but empirical and verifiable evidence. This is not an argument from probability, so we are not arguing the likelihood of a Hells existence. We are specifically debating that Hell does not exist My adversary is Pro so he has the BOP to shown beyond a doubt hell does not exist, not that it does probably not exist. If he shows it probably does not exist he looses, he must show that it does not exist with objective and empirical evidence. Per the rules I will debate the issues he requested I debate and then offer refutations. C1) God Exists I can lay out arguments to show that God possibly exists and it is likely that he exists. I do not need to show that he exists because that is not my burden of proof. My adversary has the BOP to show that Hell exists all around, I need simply show that a God possibly exists. Note : Even if I am incapable of doing this, this does not effect this debate. The BOP is still on him to show that hell does not exist. Points for God A basic outline for the KCA [P1] Everything that exists has a cause [P2] The universe began to exist [C] The universe has a cause. What we can see is that cause is most likely the big bang. We know the big bang exists because of CMBR [1]. So that brings up the question what caused the CMBR, then one caused the matter that caused it. This premise can be applied to anything back until we could trace the origin of time. Everything was created at the time of the big bang, so if matter was created at the time of the big bang what caused the big bang. At some point it is logical to believe a deistic God created the universe. It may not be probable, but it is a logical belief. C2) Hell Essentially a place of eternal torment for sinners. This could be literally or metaphorically. The issue with this is that my adversary must limit down the scope of a specific hell and show that it exists. There an infinite number of possible hells. In his last round he chose to narrow this down to a christian hell. He defined it as punishment God gives us The first thing i would like to note is that he did not make hell a tangible place. This could very well be a concept in the mind. Meaning hell could be different in every possible mind. [P1] If hell is not tangible it can vary in each mind, and has infinite possibilities [P2] according to my adversary hell is not tangible [P3] There could be an infinite number of possible hells. C3) God is loving Love is subjective both to us and non tangible beings if they exist. The definition is relative, there is no way to define Gods perception of love. C4) Possibility Possibility - The fact or state of being possible. Possible - Capable of happening, existing, or being true without contradicting proven facts, laws, or circumstances. For something to be possible it must have the chance to be true without contradicting empirical facts. The fact that hell exists is possible. There is no empirical evidence to show that it does not. Most people can only logically assume that hell does not exist. This does not mean that it is true, it means that there is a high probability that hell may not exist. So we can acknowledge that hell could exist, because there is no way to show that hell existing is contradicting proven facts or empirical evidence. Therefore hell existing is a possibility. My adversary must show some type of empirical evidence that shows that hell does not exist. If he is able to show this the existence of hell will contradict known facts, therefore it would not be possible. There is no evidence to support this claim however, and there is no empirical evidence to show that it does not exist therefore hell could possibly exist. R1) Hell is a punishment I addressed most of this in C2 R2) Choice of Sin We chose to sin because of free will. God made us with the intent of choosing him openly, not forcing us to worship him because he could make us. He was well aware most of us would sin and that others would accept him. If he is intangible and omnipotent, he knows all and sees all so everything is already preordained. Punishment would equate to justice and justice is based on perception. In this case the perception of the non tangible being that is labeled as God. This is the same concept as love. We have no idea what is love and justice to him, but it could be any number of possible things. R3) Some thoughts he had This entire thing is false and can be answered with free will. We sin openly because God allows us to make our own choices. In all honesty this is non applicable to this debate. You wind this up by saying the idea of going to hell is wrong That is a non sequitur in this type of debate. By saying that someone going to hell is wrong, you are admitting a hell exists which concedes this point to me. Whether or not is wrong is entirely irreverent because we are discussing whether it exists, not whether it is a just punishment. Concussion My adversary has not shown that hell does not exist. I have shown that it could possibly exist. He has not upheld his bop/ [1] http://www.astro.ucla.edu..."	CON	27
Sdaa3ed6f-A9325d8cb	There is no Hell	"Opponent: ""Okay, during the time of Jesus there was only the Old Testament, which, by the way, has NO teaching of hell. So basically Jesus just invented the concept, or... Also, here is another problem."" So Jesus lied. But Jesus was perfect, he never sinned. Lying is a sin, so how could Jesus lie? Opponent: Okay, first I'm going to comment on this and then I'm going to present a straight question for which I expect a straight answer. Comment: Christians are not better than the rest of mankind. If a Christian tries to be perfect, and an atheist tries to be perfect, why is ONLY the Christian allowed into Heaven? Because the word perfect is used in a spiritual sense. It is impossible for an atheist to be perfect when compared to a Christian. Because believing is the requirement for entering, and atheists don't believe. Opponent: Person 1 is Hitler. Person 2 is Mother Theresa. On the very last second of his life, Hitler became a Christian. On the very last second of her life, Mother Theresa became a Hindu. According to the Bible, Hitler is allowed into Heaven and Mother Theresa will be sent to the everlasting flames of hell. How is this logical? God doesn't need logic. Nothing about Christianity has to be ""logical"". Logic is a philosophical element invented by men. The Bible is based on faith and belief, therefore it doesn't need logic to back it up. And one of the aspects of belief in repentance, so not only would Hitler have to believe he would have to repent and be baptized. Opponent: Or why couldn't he take us all into heaven? He can't help somebody who doesn't believe in him. Opponent: Okay. If I were your child [or best friend] (as humans are god's children), could you, as a loving father, send me to a place of torture, and pain? If you did that, would you also make me immortal so that I could not simply die, but would have to endure the pain and who knows what for an eternity? No. But, I can't answer for God. Opponent: Are you saying that God is dependent of his creations? This poses several problems, of which I'd like to mention one. How could god have created the universe when there were no humans around? God created much simpler beings than we are today. Think about it, when God created Adam and Eve, they we're truly his ""children"". We had no concept of right and wrong, we were naive, ignorant, etc. However, we ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we become exposed to the idea of right and wrong. We became much more complex, and much more powerful. Opponent: Since God is almighty, he could just basically say, ""Hey! Give those souls to me!"" After all, Satan is his creation. Don't you think God has more power over his creation than his creation over him? Actually, Satan wasn't created by God (it's never stated in the account of creation). And plus, evil is the absence of God, so how could God save the evil? Opponent: ""I agree 110%. However, it is said that you don't need to love God in order to gain salvation, you need to believe in him."" You need to believe, repent, and be baptized, and most of that requires a love for God. Opponent: What is so good about believing in God that it entitles for salvation? Why couldn't he just take all of us to heaven? Because belief and love come hand in hand. And the whole reason why God created man, in my opinion, was to be loved. We must give a little love to get some. Opponent: So, if in heaven an atheist (while he was alive) says, ""Hey, God, listen. I know I've been an atheist, but now that I'm finally able to see for myself you, hell and heaven, I believe in you! I'm a Christian now! Don't send me into hell!"" he will still be sent to hell? Interesting. [FYI, the Bible says that after a man dies, he cannot change his fate.] Because a blind faith is a more loving thing than a faith backed by facts. Opponent: Okay. Let me make this clear. The Bible says many times that if you sin, you go to Hell for eternity [and since Jesus took all the sins of the world on him, he should be in Hell forever.]. However, in the Gospels etc etc it is said that he arose after three days! This is a contradiction. That's what I was trying to say. So, how do you explain the contradiction? God bought him back. And since Jesus was God in the flesh, God had control over him. And bought him back. Opponent: In the 4th century the NT was translated into Latin. A coincidence? Using this strategy you could nullify everything in the Bible. Who is to say the passage that God is a loving God is not a mistranslation? Closing remarks: Without a heaven and hell, the whole purpose of religion is lost. If everyone went to the same place no matter what, there would be no encouragement to love him. Trust in the Bible, the Bible says: Hell is real. Don't rely on this idea that some parts are mistranslated, if we use that mentality the whole bible becomes useless. Think about it. Believe in him. Love him. Amen."	CON	28
Sbca00611-Aa3259d1c	there is no such thing as hell.	"Possibiltilities are the potential for things to be real. There are numbers betwene 1 and 0. Odds if you will. The more knolwedege and experience you have will increase that possibiltiy for the likelyhood of that to be real. Thus you can say a possibility is an idea or thought that is tranforming into existiance. I would argue harry potter is not possible because it is outside the realms of scientific plausability. thus there is no chance for it to be a realitly. Only know it true, I think that is only in an individuals perspective. What if you have false memories? Are those memories real despite the fact that they were warped from what was real? Imagination is the exploration of possibiltiies while odds are most cannot be possible, imagination is what transforms our current being into something new. That is what innovation is all about, having an idea (which is not real) and creating it so that it is real. Thus without the real idea of it per say... It would never exist. Your argument is attempting to paint pictures in black and white, however you are missing the fact that we live in many shades of grey (50 right?) As a child you offred rewards for your behavior, like a cookie for being quiet in class. Does that cookie exist? No but the real possibility of geting that cookie drives the child to be successful in their classroom. So just because at that moment the possibiltiy is false and they child does not see the cookie, does not deem that the cookie does not exist nor does it mean they will not receieve a cookie. The same concept for hel. You might not believe it exists, you will not know it exists until your deaths, but its possibility is real enough. So back to the matter at hand pascals wager is a common sense argument in why it is more logical to accept the possibility of hell as real rather than say its fault be default. From the wiki: Pascal's original formulation of the wager was written down as a fairly short paragraph in Pensées amongst several other notes that could be considered ""wagers"".[1] Its argument is rooted in game theory and that the best course of action is to believe in God regardless of any lack of evidence, because that option gives the biggest potential gains. Pascal's original text is long-winded and somewhat convoluted philosophy-speak,[2] but it can be distilled more simply: If you believe in God and God does exist, you will be rewarded with eternal life in heaven: thus an infinite gain. If you do not believe in God and God does exist, you will be condemned to remain in hell forever: thus an infinite loss. If you believe in God and God does not exist, you will not be rewarded: thus a finite loss. If you do not believe in God and God does not exist, you will not be rewarded, but you have lived your own life: thus a finite gain. The gains and losses associated to outcomes 3 and 4 can be thought of as the opportunity costs of feigning belief and living in accordance with religious norms, since these are typically more restrictive than secular laws. These costs are finite because of human mortality. Mathematically, a finite gain or loss is negligible compared to an infinite gain or loss as would be incurred during an eternal afterlife. Therefore, Pascal concluded that it was a much better choice to believe in God rather than not. The Wager can also be seen in table form and it becomes clear that belief gives you a reward or (practically) nothing, while disbelief gives you punishment or nothing: Re-affirms the poin that the idea of hell is not only real but benficial to know it exists."

Sbca00611-A311e781a	there is no such thing as hell.	I am trying to prove to the people that there is somthing as Hell, While I can clearly see your view on what reality is. I am confident the masses would agree thet the world population is beyond your infividual experience and is not reduced to one because you dont see anyone. That sort of logic makes me question the point of even debating? You are the only one debating we are not even real? What purpose to you have to convince other fake entities online on your point? They do not exist thus they are all lies. If everything outside of your experience, how does the world come in and out of existance just for you? How would you have electricity to use your laptop? Things happen beyond your experiences that make up reality. So back to proving the idea of hell to people. I cannot with a doubt prove that god exists, nor can I give you an experience of hell. as hell is concidered an after life experience. Howvever can make you wonder about the possibilty of hell and let you, and you alone think about the concepts of hell. 1) The relegious idea of hell One concept of hell is that there is a god, and that god created all of us. He also created an afterlife for us to go to after our deaths. Hell in this persepective is the abandonment of god. Thus we come to the realization that god exists after our death but we are left out of the party into eternal damnnation. Thus for people who belief in god, generally have a fear of hell. There are lots of arguments for and against it, people saying they saw the light from a coma and coming back from heaven. 2) The M therory I cant explain it all. This idea is is that while we experience life as linear, in a 4th dimention we are actually in a circle, Our life is all written down and we repeat the cylce for eternty. Thus the way you lived your life will be a literal hell depending on the choices you made as you re-experience. 3) Living eternally in your own mind another theory is the conciousness cannot die with the body, and thus you continue to dream or relive your experiences for all eternity. Thus the idea of hell in this case is living with remorse or guilt or find the good experirence to remember.	CON	30
S776b55ae-Acee248cb	There is no hell	This debate is almost over from this point, and I will explain why R1) BOP I agreed to take the argument per round 1 that God exists. Arguing that God exists is not the BOP nor is it the resoultion. The resolution is , there is no hell Note : God existing or not existing does not prove there is a hell. That is your BOP to show there is no hell In addition , I used the KCA to show that a God could exist. However in the last round, you stated and agreed that God does exist. So me debating that he does exist is entirely pointless from that point. R2 ) Not relevant to the debate Even if you were to find sources in this specific topic, it will not prove a hell exists. At most the evidence is circumstantial if even valid. We can dismiss this as presenting new arguments in the last round is against basic procedure. R3) Love Love=/= Justice Which was the entire point behind that premise. God sends us to hell as a form of justice for rejecting him. This entire point in this round is not relevant to the resolution. R4) If God exists, hell does not exist This is entirely false, and I shot this entire argument down in my last round. The premise behind the arguments is that God loves us so he would not send us to hell. This is false, and I have explained why countless times. If God does exist he would send us to hell for rejecting him. Justice to God and justice to us are entirely different. My adversary is taking his perception of justice and love and applying it objectively. This is false. R5) non topicable This is not even relevant to the debate. Conclusion. This debate is almost over from this point. I debated the points my adversary wanted me to debate which all have been dropped, and he has failed to uphold his burden of proof to show that the resolution is true. He must show that hell does not exist. Again he can not show that it probably does not exist, but that there is no possibility it exists. See my possibility argument for clarification.	CON	31

So let's lay it out in a final syllogism [P1] For there to be no possibility of hell, it would have to contradict proven fact or laws. [P2] Hell does not contradict any proven facts or laws. [C] There is a possibility hell exists. This is a top down syllogism meaning you need P1>P2>C. There is no way to get verifiable or empirical evidence to support or disprove the existence of hell one way or the other. We can only make logical assumptions. A logical assumption or dealing in odds odds of probably is not contradicting any known laws. For there to be no possibility of hell existing it would have to contradict a known law, which is intrinsically impossible given its nature. That is why he has failed to uphold the BOP.

S90e95f61-A34327090	The Images of Hell are Metaphors Pointing to a Real, but Indefinable State.	"========== INTRODUCTION ========== I would like to welcome Scoundrel to DDO and thanks for accepting the debate subject at hand and welcome to our readers as well. ========================== BACKGROUND: GRAPHIC VIEWS OF HELL ========================== It is important to understand the historical background concerning the literary genre that has come to be known as ""The Tours of Hell"" that most of the literalist use in their understanding and teaching of the doctrine of hell that goes beyond what Scripture reveals about the nature of hell and resort into speculations. [1] The literal view of hell dominated Christian thinking from the time of Augustine (fifth century) until the Reformers (sixteenth century). [2] However, it can be traced all the way back to the Old Testament pseudepigrapha: Jewish texts and and New Testament apocrypha. [3] In the fourth century, Italian poet Dante Alighieri fueled these early speculations in his work ""Divine Comedy."" Not intended to be taken literally, yet as Eldon Woodcock, Ph.D. Professor Emeritus of Bible Woodcock, stated, ""problems developed when many subsequent readers, imitative writers, and preachers forgot these descriptions were speculations and treated them rather as theological dogma."" [4] The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many preachers and theologians such as Charles H. Spurgeon and Jonathan Edwards, ignoring the warnings by Martin Luther and John Calvin, expected hell to be a literal sea of fire even including satanic/demonic participation. [5] 20th and 21th centuries, most literalist follow ""the Tour of Hell"" teachings such as those by Mary K. Baxter's ""Divine Revelation of Hell"" [6] and the minority may not necessarily agree with Baxter's teachings (demonic participation, etc), yet they still hold to the fire image to be literal. ====== My Case ====== P1. The figures of speech that describe hell are contradictory if taken in a physical sense. The Bible authors opposite descriptions of hell can hardy be missed. Jude pictures hell ""blackest darkness"" (Jude 13), yet in verse 7 it is pictured as ""eternal fire."" Matthew also gives the opposite images of fire (Matthew 3:10, 12; 25:41) and darkness (Matthew 8:12; 22:13; 25:30). It is a dump (with a bottom) , yet a bottomless pit. [7] Other Bible verses also use the idea of fire symbolically: Psalm 78:21 (figure of the anger of God), Hebrews 12:29; Deut. 4:24; Jer. 23:29 (God's ability as a jealous God), James 3:6 (the destructive nature of the tongue), Psalm 104:4 (used to describe the glory of God's angels), 1 Cor. 3:13 (describe the purifying effect of fire upon metals). As Geisler states, ""While everything in the Bible is literally true, not everything is true literally."" [8] P2. The resurrected bodies of the wicked are imperishable physical bodies which normal fire would not affect them. [9] 1 Corinthians 15 is the most extensive discourse on the resurrection in the New Testament. [10] The chapter itself deals with the resurrection of the saints where Paul use the seed metaphor to explain what what kind of a body the resurrection body will be. Wright states, ""The distinction he is making is between a body a, ""physical""body in our sense, that is animated by normal human energy (a ""natural"" body in other words), and the new body which will be animated by God's spirit, in other words, a ""spiritual"" body in the sense of a spirit-generated and spirit-animated body."" [11] However, it is logical by inference that the resurrected body of the wicked will also be incorruptible and will never be dissolved. Cooper makes an important statement which needs to be pointed out, ""....individual and environment share some commonness of nature."" [12] That is to say, the spiritual body will be adapted to the spirit world. Because ""....resurrection involve a total transformation of the body's essence and appearance into a heavenly or spiritual being."" [13] That being the case, a normal fire would not affect them. P3. The eternal fire was created for spirit beings such as the devil and his angels (Matthew 5:41). Furthering the case, not only will spiritual bodies not be affected by physical fire, neither will disembodies spirits. P4. In ancient times, teachers often used words symbolically to underscore their points (rabbinic hyperbole). [14] Most of Jesus teachings was in the form of a parable. It was what a common method used by rabbis. In fact, the very word ""parable"" denotes ""comparison or similitude."" In other words, Jesus used the natural to impart spiritual insight or truth. In the Old Testament, the parable (mashal) is used as a warning as well as for an example. [15] A. The meaning of the weeping and gnashing of teeth. Alfred Edersheim, one of the leading authorities of his time regarding the doctrines and practices of Judaism in the centuries preceding and during the early Christian era, made this statement, ""Associated with it is ""the weeping"" and the gnashing of teeth. In Rabbinic thought the former was connected with sorrow, the latter almost always with anger---not generally supposed with anguish."" [16] This is also the meaning of the expression in Ps. 112:10. Edersheim also points out that the verb is used with this idea in Acts 7:45, and in the Septuagint, Job 16:; Ps 35:16; 37:12; and in Rabbinical writings, for example, Jer. Keth 35b; Shem R 5ff. [17] ========= CONCLUSION ========= The Bible authors used pictures of hell that are irreconcilable if taken literally (the law of non-contradiction). If a literal meaning is absurd according to Biblical hermeneutics, than it is to be interpreted figuratively. [18] As Geisler puts it, ""Nowhere does the Bible describe it as a ""torture chamber"" where people are forced against their will to be tortured. This is a caricature created by unbelievers to justify their reaction that the God who sends people to hell is cruel. This does not mean that hell is not a place of torment. Jesus said it was (Luke 16:24). But unlike torture which is inflicted from without against one's will, torment is self-inflicted. Even atheists have suggested that the door of hell is locked from the inside. We are condemned to our own freedom from God. Heaven's presence of the divine would be the torture to one who has irretrievably rejected him. Torment is living with the consequences of our own bad choices. It is the weeping and gnashing of teeth that results from the realization that we blew it and deserve the consequences."" [19] Sources: 1. http://www.reclaimingthemind.org... 2.

You have to prove that souls physically exist... which they do not. Souls do not exist of matter, so they do not physically exist, which would mean people do not have souls and then would not go to heaven or hell. Unless you can prove that souls have matter, I win this debate. You must have forgotten that you also have the burden of proof as well. More importantly, you have not tried to negate me when I said that Hell also does not physically exist. ""we have not yet penetrated the earth's crust, the outer most layer, so we cannot say, with absolute certanty, that it does not exist within the earth, therefore you have yet to meet your burden of proof."" Really? If nobody has penetrated Earth's crust, then that means nobody knows where hell is. Then, how would we know if it exists if nobody knows where it is? Surely if someone saw Hell, then we would know where it is... OH! But wait, Hell doesn't physically exist anyway. ""I also object to your definition of real. How about simply existing."" Sorry, but those two terms are not interchangeable. The statement was, ""I will not go to hell when I die because hell is not real."" I agree that hell exists, but it is not real. You got a better definition of real? ""something does not need to be a physical entity to be real. for example logical absolutes are real, the laws of physics are real, the number 2 is real."" So? Your point? Find me a definition that says Hell is real. Here's a starting point: http://www.merriam-webster.com... ""I don't understand what you meant in the last part of your definition ' having properties that deviate from an ideal, law, or standard'"" It doesn't matter since Hell is not a physical entity. ""but i think we can agree that if something exists, it is real."" Okay, prove it. Like I said, exist & real are not the same words. How can I go to hell if I do not have a physical soul and Hell does not physically exist? Because of this, it also means that Hell is simply imaginary, and people do not go to Hell or Heaven because they just don't physically exist. When you die, you die. You don't go to Heaven, you don't go to Hell. Your brain is dead, all your thoughts and memories are gone. Thus, I will not go to hell if I murder people, because Hell does not physically exist.

Sdaa3ed6f-A14cb4a	There is no Hell	"Before commenting on my opponent's response, let me present another piece of evidence. Let's examine the parable of Lasarus and the rich man, found in the New Testament, Luke 17:19-31. ""There was a rich young man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat wha fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came to lick his sores. The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side (heaven). The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus on his side. So he called up to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' [Read on, here's where it gets interesting.] But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is in comfort here and you are in agony. **AND besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that who want to go from here to you cannot, nor anyone cross over there to us.**'"" Read the last sentence again. First of all, GOD should be able to cross from one place to another, since he is said to be almighty in the Bible countless times. However, since ""who want to go from here to you CANNOT"", God is not almighty. So, we have two possibilities. Either: 1) God is not almighty, and therefore we have been officially fooled. Also, the Bible therefore contains lies, and since the Bible is the word of God and God cannot lie... We are faced with a dilemma. Maybe God is not loving. Maybe God is not just. Maybe God is not this and that. 2) There is no hell. The passage goes on to say that rhe rich man begged god to send someone to warn his brothers about hell, but god declined. So, god had a chance to save five plus people from eternal flame and torture, but he CHOSE not to. Again, is this a loving god or is there no hell [this passage could've been added as a scare to make people behave or maybe it was a mistake in translation.]? [quote]First of all I have a personal question for you that doesn't relate to this debate: Are these views your own or do they represent the beliefs of the Lutheran church?[/quote] The Lutheran church has nothing to do with this. These are my own views. You could say I'm a rebel ;) [quote]First of all, I totally reject the statement that God is vindictive. If God is so vindictive then why doesn't he just destroy the world for all of the sin that is in it?[/quote] He will, as is established in the Revalation of John. And let me rephrase the statement. ""If my daughter is in Hell because she did not get ""born again"" then I'd rather go to Hell and be with her than to be with your God."" [quote]It is just and fair because we all have the capacity to believe in Jesus Christ. Like if you see a child that's been run over by a car, and you do not stop to help him or her you are just as bad as the person driving the car. And plus, some people don't deserve eternity in paradise.[/quote] Okay. If I were your child [or best friend] (as humans are god's children), could you, as a loving father, send me to a place of torture, and pain? If you did that, would you also make me immortal so that I could not simply die, but would have to endure the pain and who knows what for an eternity? Could you? No. Then how could god, who is said to *be* love? ""God IS love."" Here is my logical problem with hell. Why does God only allow those who believe in him into heaven, regardless of what they did? Is believing in something a good enough basis to send someone into *everlasting torture*, aka. Hell, aka. lake of fire. Second, why doesn't god just take all people into heaven, regardless of whether or not they believed in him? That would be loving (saving the creatures HE CREATED from everlasting torture.) Let's suppose there a guy dies, is an atheist, and goes up to heaven and before god. ""Thou did not believe in me."" ""I know, but please, give me another chance, I don't want to go to be tortured forever!"" ""You did not belive in me. After death, you have no chance of changing your fate (as established in the parable of Lasarus and the rich man) after you die."" *He is thrown into hell.* Is that a loving god? And why did god create creatures that were destined to go to a place of everlasting torture and pain unless they did something? Isn't that sadistic/cruel? ""It is irrelevant how many sins you have committed. As it says in John 3:16: ""For God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son and whoever believes in him shall never die but have eternal life."" So the requirements for entering Heaven is not walking the straight and narrow: It's a belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God."" Indeed. This is not logical. Why does God value *belief* in something more than actions? Using this logic, we can put Hitler, Mao, and Stalin into heaven if they believed in god, while Mother Theresa could be in hell if she became an atheist during her last minute alive. Or maybe we're all saved and there is no hell. [quote]I would like to disagree. We all know we only have so much time on this Earth. So, if we choose not to follow Christ in the only life we have, what other option does God have?[/quote] For one, he could take us all into heaven [supposing there is a hell]? I don't belive a single human AFTER SEEING hell would seriously rather go there. [quote]God is a loving God. However, he is also a just God. There are several examples of this in scripture. The first is the story of Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve did something they were told they couldn't do. Therefore, they were kicked out of Eden. So this proves that God is a just God. I believe that God is just as human as the rest of us and he gets angry, sad, happy, etc. That's like your mother doesn't love you because she's grounded you a couple of times.[/quote] Being kicked out of heaven and an everlasting trip to a ""lake of fire"", filled with sadistic demons wanting to make every second of your eternity a nightmare are hardly comparable. [quote]Why didn't he tell Adam and Eve that? Because he didn't know if they would eat from the tree of good and evil.[/quote] The Bible says countless times that God knows our lives, from our first cry to our last breath, thorougly before we are even born. And secondly, if god is almighty, don't you think he could see into the future? [quote]No, first of all Jesus was only dead for three days. He was resurrected and 40 days later ascended to HEAVEN. A first grade Sunday school class could tell you that...[/quote] Well, if ""the wage for sins"" is eternal torture, then either 1) There is no hell 2) As we are writing, Jesus is being tortured in hell. Since number 2 is not possible, we end up with number two. [quote]That was the OLD testament. The NEW testament (which is the basis of Christianity, and aren't we debating about Christian Hell; not Jewish Hell) makes several references to Heaven and Hell. And I thought you were trying to prove that Hell doesn't exist, well you just contradicted yourself. And I believe that when Christ returns a 2nd time, those who died before his death will be able to ascend to Heaven.[/quote] I was trying to prove the illogicality of hell. If hell is separation from god, then why does the Bible say ""Thou I make my bed in hell, thou art there."" And yes, OT is a part of the holy book of Christians. We can't just dismiss the whole OT and only look at NT. [quote]Christians are people. People don't always get everything right.[/quote] Okay. During the 4th century, most of the people believed everyone was going to get saved. Now most believe in hell. What happened? A faulty translation?

S776b55ae-A7dda3ada	There is no hell	"Thank you for your reply. Just before I move onto the main rebbutles, I just want to say that in Round 2, I state the following: ""By Hell I mean there is no fair punishment that God gives us"" so I did mean that by Hell and just to state that I said that if God loves us, why would he punish us? That certainly states that God exists. So my point that there is no Hell is just saying that God exists and does not give us any punishments. And finally I do not see how this could possibly be related to Zeus (if I am talking about a loving God). Now onto the points: Point 1. You have ignored or missed one of my rules which is: Believe in God or Debate as if he does, by saying that I have to prove that God exists because it will be you who, by accepting this debate, has to prove it as well. However I will go on to prove that God either exists or is something special and thus it is more likely for him to exist: RELIGION ITSELF When people claim to have a holy feeling when they enter religion and are mainly happy and happiness is (as far a we know) going positive and not negative for the feeling that humans get when they are happy is known as positive so obviously religion itself must be something special and so it is very likely that God exists. (For information on this I would recommend searching on the Internet for Monks and Nuns experiences, this is not where I got my information from but it will prove that I am right. Point 2. By Hell it is obvious that it is not a metaphor for how would God be able to punish us like that? So your point saying that it could be metaphoric is not revelent. By Hell I could easily mean a Christian Hell but it is mainly suggesting any Hell with a God that loves us, however if I use the evidence of Monks and Nuns then it is Christian and I am arguing about a Christian Hell but it could be any Hell that I am arguing that there is not, with any God that loves us. The Hell that I am arguing about is not tangible to the human body but the human soul. There could not be an infinite number of possible hells because we don't have an infinite choice because the idea of Hell is one idea and thus although there could be many possible Hells, it could not go forever because what we have and what we live in is limited in ideas, i.e. : There would have to be some possible idea to go with Hell in the whole Universe. So that is what I mean by Hell. Point 3. We can easily tell what God thinks love is, the love that we know is the love that God created and how else would we know love if God did not create it for us, unless the Devil or the Opposite to God created it, and as far as we know, God created love and kindness himself and that is what we know him as (a loving God) and so you will have to prove what love is if God did not create it for us and know it, himself. Point 4. If a loving God exists, then it is impossible to have a Hell. And I have used the evidence that God exists in Point 2. I am not talking about the possibility of Hell if a loving God exists, I am saying that it is impossible. Point 5. Why would God choose us to continue? Why would he not just end human lives with non pain? So God would (if he were a loving God ) give us a choice to sin? And remember my example of Vlad the Impaler who put people on wooden spikes, or Joseph Stalin who starved the Ukrainians or Mao Zedong who ordered his men to make steel instead of the food that they needed and ordered his people to beat and humiliate his own people by force, God by giving us a choice would be the father of evil doings as well as the father of good doings. And of course God sees things the same way as we do, if we are his creation and we know thing that are associated with Church and Religion ( the ones that preach a loving religion) as the love and kindness that we know. And how come when humans do good, they feel happier and I recommend that you find out about people like Stalin who destroyed themselves because of doing evil. Now could you please tell me what you mean by: BOP. Thank you for replying to my debate. Have a nice day :). Back to you Con."	PRO	37
Sdaa3ed6f-Ac31f297f	There is no Hell	"This time I'll try to be as brief as possible, in hope that someone might actually have the patience to read through ;) (I think this might be one of my best debates so far, thank you.) [quote]Therefore God, who isn't a person, has the ability to cross between Heaven and Hell. However, he chooses not to. [/quote] Touche! So, he *could* save millions (maybe even billions) of non-christian souls from eternal torture, but he CHOOSES not to. Is that loving? Having a chance to end someone's torment, but choosing not to? [quote]I said: ""The passage goes on to say that the rich man begged god to send someone to warn his brothers about hell, but god declined. So, god had a chance to save five plus people from eternal flame and torture, but he CHOSE not to."" My opponent said: He didn't send any warning? The whole story of Lazarus and the rich man is a warning about the horrors we'll face in hell if you do not believe in God.[/quote] Okay, during the time of Jesus there was only the Old Testament, which, by the way, has NO teaching of hell. So basically Jesus just invented the concept, or... Also, here is another problem. [quote]Actually, the destruction of the world is never established in Revelation. The creation of a New Heaven and a New Earth is though.[/quote] Well, this is a question of definition. Revelation 21:1. ""...For the first earth and heaven had passed away."" And for one, this universe will not be around forever. [quote]God doesn't expect us to be perfect. But, he does expect us to try. That is why non-believers go to Hell and believers go to Heaven. No one deserves to go to Heaven, we only get there by the Grace of God.[/quote] Okay, first I'm going to comment on this and then I'm going to present a straight question for which I expect a straight answer. Comment: Christians are not better than the rest of mankind. If a Christian tries to be perfect, and an atheist tries to be perfect, why is ONLY the Christian allowed into Heaven? The question (and this is a ""what if""-type of question.) I expect a clear and straight answer.: Person 1 is Hitler. Person 2 is Mother Theresa. On the very last second of his life, Hitler became a Christian. On the very last second of her life, Mother Theresa became a Hindu. According to the Bible, Hitler is allowed into Heaven and Mother Theresa will be sent to the everlasting flames of hell. How is this logical? Rhetorical question: Why does god only allow those who believed in him to heaven? Why doesn't he value our actions more? Or why couldn't he take us all into heaven? [quote]First of all, I believe that God doesn't WANT us to go to Hell. However, I believe that he allows us to. God didn't create Hell (it's never stated in the account of creation recorded in Genesis); however when he disbanded Satan from Heaven, he kicked him into hell. God gets his power from those who believe in him. If no one believed in God, then he would be powerless. We are his tools, his work is reflected in us. That is called the Holy Spirit and it is a widely accepted component of Christianity. So, I believe that God is helpless to help someone who doesn't believe in him. That person's soul belongs to the devil, so therefore it is controlled by Satan.[/quote] You completely dodged my question. Although you made a point (which I'll get to), I would like an answer for this question. Answer this question. Think it has nothing to do with hell. Think It has nothing to do with anything. One word will be enough (yes or no.) Okay. If I were your child [or best friend] (as humans are god's children), could you, as a loving father, send me to a place of torture, and pain? If you did that, would you also make me immortal so that I could not simply die, but would have to endure the pain and who knows what for an eternity? (Just so that you know, the above question is a checkmate to anyone who believes in hell.) And now to your point. Let's go one thing at a time. ""First of all, I believe that God doesn't WANT us to go to Hell. However, I believe that he allows us to."" ""God didn't create Hell (it's never stated in the account of creation recorded in Genesis);"" To be exact, there is no mention of hell in the OT. ""...however when he disbanded Satan from Heaven, he kicked him into hell."" ...So why do humans have to go there? Couldn't God have made a little less... painful... place for non-Christians? Like A prison? ""God gets his power from those who believe in him. If no one believed in God, then he would be powerless."" Are you saying that God is dependant of his creations? This poses several problems, of which I'd like to mention one. How could god have created the universe when there were no humans around? ""We are his tools, his work is reflected in us. That is called the Holy Spirit and it is a widely accepted component of Christianity. ""So, I believe that God is helpless to help someone who doesn't believe in him."" Therefore you're saying that God is NOT almighty. Notice the word ""HELPLESS"". ""That person's soul belongs to the devil, so therefore it is controlled by Satan."" Since God is almighty, he could just basically say, ""Hey! Give those souls to me!"" After all, Satan is his creation. Don't you think God has more power over his creation than his creation over him? And now the rest. [quote]So God should create a bunch of robots who have no choice other than to love him? If you're forced to love something or somebody or some God, is it a true love?[/quote] I agree 110%. However, it is said that you don't need to love God in order to gain salvation, you need to believe in him. [quote]The only reason the New Testament is included in the Christian Bible is for 2 reasons. 1) For our education. 2) To show the contrast in the world before and after the coming of Christ.[/quote] ""The only reason that the NEW Testament is..."" I understand. We all make mistakes. Errare humanum est ;) And now to the point you were making. Maybe, just maybe there are other reasons for the OT being in the Bible. For one, Jesus said: ""Truly I twll you, Until heaven and earth pass away, not even one yoth [Hebrew for: smallest letter] or a dash shall pass away from the law [old Testament] until it is all fulfilled."" Second of all, the God it's the same God speaking in OT and NT. [quote]Yes. God doesn't expect us to be perfect, he expects us to believe. We can't be perfect, God isn't going to hold us to a standard so high that no one on Earth can ever meet it.[/quote] Question: What is so good about believing in God that it entitles for salvation? Why couldn't he just take all of us to heaven? [quote]Part B is true. However, Part A doesn't make any sense. But, he doesn't have any authority over it. We decide for ourselves if we are going to Hell or not.[/quote] So, if in heaven an atheist (while he was alive) says, ""Hey, God, listen. I know I've been an atheist, but now that I'm finally able to see for myself you, hell and heaven, I believe in you! I'm a Christian now! Don't send me into hell!"" he will still be sent to hell? Interesting. [FYO, the Bible says that after a man dies, he cannot change his fate.] [quote]BUT JESUS WAS DEAD FOR ONLY THREE DAYS!!! He rose from the dead and ascended to HEAVEN. This is described many times in the Bible in Mark 16:19-20, Luke 24:50-53, and Acts 1:9-12.[/quote] Okay. Let me make this clear. The Bible says many times that if you sin, you go to Hell for eternity [and since Jesus took all the sins of the world on him, he should be in Hell forever.]. However, in the Gospels etc etc it is said that he arose after three days! This is a contradiction. That's what I was trying to say. So, how do you explain the contradiction? [quote]None of the above things happened. They simply discovered the scripture that proved the existence of hell.[/quote] In the 4th century the NT was translated into Latin. A coincidence?"	PRO	38
Sc05807e6-Ae574bc7c	This House Believes that Hell exists	"I'm rather excited about this one. I'll attempt to keep everything clear. I must start off by saying that the bible (or any religious book, for that matter) does not offer a very accurate representation of what Hell is, or could be. It's about as useful as Dante's Inferno, which is a nice read if you enjoy gruesome tortures being inflicted on people you hate, but not a good source of true evidence. A good depiction of Hell would most likely be Michigan, Hiland Lake in all honesty. However, I'll try to refrain from making jokes about that and will stick to the Hell you have defined. Hinduism is the best place to turn if one wishes for evidence on Hell being a real place. Now when I say this, I do not mean ""eternal damnation"", because that is not what they believe in. I'm speaking of karma. Put as simply as possible, Hindus believe that we all have free will, but of the decisions we make we either get bad karma or good karma. This karma will follow a person even to death and into the next life. That being said, everything that happens to a person is well deserved. If a woman in Africa has her genitals mutilated, which is something that happens quite often in certain parts of that continent, she deserved it. If a child is born without legs and has to suffer hardship his entire life, he deserved it. What does this have to do with Hell? ""Hell: the place where the souls of bad people are believed to be punished after death, especially in the Christian and Muslim religions"""". The Earth is a ""place"", and no one in life is ever truly innocent, and so the evidence of it's existence is the suffering of mankind at this very moment. It need not be a McDonald's hiding somewhere in the cosmos with the intention of giving bad customer service for eternity with a broken air conditioning unit. It is here, a current thing that we can all see and feel. Reincarnation is a very real thing, and IS something that has been scientifically proven. This means that every single thing will always be in Hell because mistakes can never be corrected, only repeated. This is because the past cannot be remembered when we are born. And the evidence that reincarnation is real? Let us for instance say I have just died. Because I wish for a natural burial, I will not be put into a coffin. This means my body will properly decay in the Earth, giving back what I had been given at birth. The decomposers being efficient recyclers, would be sure to take care of that, making death become life once more. Thus the cycle of life. And so, we are forever in Hell, which is indeed a place. I patiently await your rebuttals, and hope you are having a good day as well. :) Sources: 1. http://www.himalayanacademy.com... 2. http://www.collinsdictionary.com..."	PRO	39
Sdaa3ed6f-Afd481f9f	There is no Hell	"Thanks for that round! Your whole story about Lazarus is full of flaws. Read the last sentence again. It says Nor ANYONE cross over there to us. The definition of the word anyone is ""Any person at all"". Is God a person? No. God is all powerful. Is any person all powerful? No. So therefore God isn't a person. Therefore God, who isn't a person, has the ability to cross between Heaven and Hell. However, he chooses not to. Opponent: The passage goes on to say that the rich man begged god to send someone to warn his brothers about hell, but god declined. So, god had a chance to save five plus people from eternal flame and torture, but he CHOSE not to. Again, is this a loving god or is there no hell [this passage could've been added as a scare to make people behave or maybe it was a mistake in translation.]? He didn't send any warning? The whole story of Lazarus and the rich man is a warning about the horrors we'll face in hell if you do not believe in God. Opponent: He will, as is established in the Revelation of John. Actually, the destruction of the world is never established in Revelation. The creation of a New Heaven and a New Earth is though. Opponent: ""Okay. If I were your child [or best friend] (as humans are god's children), could you, as a loving father, send me to a place of torture, and pain? If you did that, would you also make me immortal so that I could not simply die, but would have to endure the pain and who knows what for an eternity"" First of all, I believe that God doesn't WANT us to go to Hell. However, I believe that he allows us to. God didn't create Hell (it's never stated in the account of creation recorded in Genesis); however when he disbanded Satan from Heaven, he kicked him into hell. God gets his power from those who believe in him. If no one believed in God, then he would be powerless. We are his tools, his work is reflected in us. That is called the Holy Spirit and it is a widely accepted component of Christianity. So, I believe that God is helpless to help someone who doesn't believe in him. That person's soul belongs to the devil, so therefore it is controlled by Satan. Opponent: Here is my logical problem with hell. Why does God only allow those who believe in him into heaven, regardless of what they did? Is believing in something a good enough basis to send someone into *everlasting torture*, aka. Hell, aka. lake of fire. Second, why doesn't god just take all people into heaven, regardless of whether or not they believed in him? That would be loving (saving the creatures HE CREATED from everlasting torture.) Let's suppose there a guy dies, is an atheist, and goes up to heaven and before god. God doesn't expect us to be perfect. But, he does expect us to try. That is why non-believers go to Hell and believers go to Heaven. No one deserves to go to Heaven, we only get there by the Grace of God. Opponent: And why did god create creatures that were destined to go to a place of everlasting torture and pain unless they did something? Isn't that sadistic/cruel? So God should create a bunch of robots who have no choice other than to love him? If you're forced to love something or somebody or some God, is it a true love? Opponent: Indeed. This is not logical. Why does God value *belief* in something more than actions? Using this logic, we can put Hitler, Mao, and Stalin into heaven if they believed in god, while Mother Theresa could be in hell if she became an atheist during her last minute alive. Yes. God doesn't expect us to be perfect, he expects us to believe. We can't be perfect, God isn't going to hold us to a standard so high that no one on Earth can ever meet it. Opponent: For one, he could take us all into heaven [supposing there is a hell]? I don't believe a single human AFTER SEEING hell would seriously rather go there. Part B is true. However, Part A doesn't make any sense. But, he doesn't have any authority over it. We decide for ourselves if we are going to Hell or not. Opponent:I was trying to prove the illogicality of hell. If hell is separation from god, then why does the Bible say ""Thou I make my bed in hell, thou art there."" And yes, OT is a part of the holy book of Christians. We can't just dismiss the whole OT and only look at NT. The only reason the New Testament is included in the Christian Bible is for 2 reasons. 1) For our education. 2) To show the contrast in the world before and after the coming of Christ. Therefore, to modern day Christians, the Old Testament has no relevance to today because of the coming of Christ. Opponent: Well, if ""the wage for sins"" is eternal torture, then either 1) There is no hell 2) As we are writing, Jesus is being tortured in hell. Since number 2 is not possible, we end up with number two. BUT JESUS WAS DEAD FOR ONLY THREE DAYS!!! He rose from the dead and ascended to HEAVEN. This is described many times in the Bible in Mark 16:19-20, Luke 24:50-53, and Acts 1:9-12. Opponent: Okay. During the 4th century, most of the people believed everyone was going to get saved.

""Souls do not exist of matter, so they do not physically exist"" why do you need a qualifier before exist? if something exists it is real whether or not it exists physically, conceptual, or through an unknown mechanism. So whether or not they are matter is irrelevant you still have to prove they do not exist in any form. pro:""we have not yet penetrated the earth's crust, the outer most layer, so we cannot say, with absolute certanty, that it does not exist within the earth, therefore you have yet to meet your burden of proof."" con: ""If nobody has penetrated Earth's crust, then that means nobody knows where hell is.

Your point? Find me a definition that says Hell is real. "" i will take this to mean you agree that something does not nead to be physical in order to be real. I bring this up because you keep using qualifiers like physically for example: ""Hell doesn't physically exist"" ""existing as a physical entity"" ""prove that souls physically exist"" ""Hell doesn't physically exist anyway."" ""I do not have a physical soul"" ""Hell does not physically exist"" given that you agreed these that being physical is irrelevant, could you stop using these qualifiers (and to the gallery, try re-reading the debate ignoring the qualifiers). the first place we need to remove this qualifier is in the much disputed defintion of real, taking it from- ""Real - existing as a physical entity and having properties that deviate from an ideal, law, or standard"" to -""Real - existing as a entity and having properties that deviate from an ideal, law, or standard"" pro: ""I don't understand what you meant in the last part of your definition [of real] ' having properties that deviate from an ideal, law, or standard'"" con ""It doesn't matter since Hell is not a physical entity."" again with the qualifier, but since you agree the second part of your definition is irrelevant lets get rid of the second part leaving us with ""Real - existing as a entity"" the 'as an entity part' seams extraneous, anything that exists is by definition an entity, but i agree that hell is an entity, so i won't fight over this. ""When you die, you die. You don't go to Heaven, you don't go to Hell. Your brain is dead, all your thoughts and memories are gone."" your soul is separate from your brain.

If hell is only a grave why is Jesus talking about eternal fire in this place? 3) Logic of the bible Hell is a place of punishment as the justice of jesus. A grave would be basicly annihilation, so it means that sinners would just cease to exist without any punishment since they wouldnt be conscious if they are annihilated. It means that sinners would have some kind of a victory in sinning and nothing would stop a sinner to sin if that would be the only issue of sin.	CON	46
S776b55ae-A411c1a4a	There is no hell	"Point 1. By Hell I mean there is no fair punishment that God gives us. To argue the fact that the ""Opposite to God"" (any opposite that could be the Devil) takes souls to Hell and God can not do anything about it would mean that Con is possibly correct, but I mean that there is no Hell that God sends us to himself. If God loves us (you might have to prove that he does not) then why would he: 1 give us a choice to do good or evil because that caused so much sadness (e.g. Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Vlad the Impaler)? 2 send or allow us to suffer in Hell? Point 2. If we are all creation of God, then why would we choose to Sin? The only reason why we would do that is if the ""Opposite to God"" gets into us and makes us do evil things and how is that our fault? Why would God want to punish us even if there was something that allowed us to choose? Point 3. In order for us to choose against God, there would have to be some force that is neither good nor bad but if God and the opposite are so powerful and the people who do evil are obviously confused in what they do and if we are not Gods ourselves and only have been created, then how would any neutral force be able to make us make a decision if we are created by God and thus think like God would want us to think and if the opposite got into us, it is the opposite that is making us do evil things and not us. So if we are creation, then how can we possibly make choices like that? I come to the conclusion that Hell is only an invention of humans possibly for hatred or for wondering where those who sin go to when they die. I say that they are given another life and another one after that until they can get all the sin out of them and go to heaven (but there are always in human form) and to prove that, I can say that the idea of Reincarnation is half correct. Either that or people who sin and do not get rid of it go nowhere or become Ghosts or there is no heaven or any other reasons that are possible but the idea of them going to hell is wrong and you will have to prove against that.

Con is making a positive claim by arguing that Hell does exist, so he has the BoP."" Since a positive claim needs to have prove to be believed, and not the negative claim, the burden of proof lies on your side. Even inn a law court, if a person makes a claim, he has to proof it, not the one that is accused, that he did not do it. My opponent did not make an own point and just tried to refute my points. ""In short, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" (-Opponent) That is true, but ""what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence"" (-C. Hitchens) Therefore, if you do not back up your positive claim (that hell does exist) with evidence, there is no reason to believe you. If you continue with your ""burden of proof"" argument that I have refuted two times by now, you have made no real argument. And the ""MAYBE GOD IS BAD"" (-Opponent) -argument is also not a real argument either, since god is just as proved as hell, which is not proved at all.

However, not only does he concede that in order to not go to hell one must repent -- meaning that a homosexual CAN go to hell -- but that it is a sin. If we were to assume that God exists, hell exists, the Bible is accurate, etc.., this is the syllogism we are left with. A. If (x) is a sin, you should, according to the Bible, be going to Hell. B. If you repent, according to the Bible, you will not go to Hell. C1. If you do not repent after committing (x) sin, you will be going to Hell, according to the Bible. My opponent states homosexuals are NOT going to hell -- meaning that not a single homosexual can go to hell, and if one does or could, my opponent loses this debate. However, this statement not only has no truth value whatsoever, meaning he cannot fulfill his burden of proof, but it is simply not the case. An atheist or agnostic will go to hell, according to the Bible, regardless of whether he or she is homosexual or heterosexual. At the same time, a believer in, say, Islam, will go to Hell, according to the Bible, if the Christian God is the real God, and vice versa, and the same can be said of any religion. So the notion that my opponent can make this positive statement is ludicrous. He cannot fulfill his burden of proof and thus has already lost this debate. My opponent's argument is this: A. If you repent, you will not go to hell. B. Homosexuals can repent. C. Homosexuals are not going to hell. A and B are true, but C is not because not all homosexuals will ""repent,"" nor will all of them follow the same religion and so forth, so on.

Now I must tell you, the real main purpose of the Bible is to tell us that we are all going to die because we are sinners and that the only way to have eternal life with God is by trusting that Jesus died for everybody, even for you. - According to John 3: 16, it says ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life"" - Romans 6: 23 says ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"" So now, here's the juicy part of it: Matthew 25: 46 says ""These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."" From this citation, we could see that people who believe in Jesus and in God would go to heaven, while the people who don't suffer in hell, eternally. But not only that, this verse is told by Jesus, Himself. He really does a good job explaining how punishment and suffering in hell is everlasting as being eternal with God. (For more information, this also why 1 Corinthians 1-4 is also important in the Christain society. It explains we, as people. could be saved from eternal damnation. - ""Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"") These are some other verses that describe the eternalness in hell, too. (For more information, the word ""these"" could be referred to people who don't believe in God.) - ""And these will pay the penalty of ETERNAL DESTRUCTION, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"" (2 Thessalonian 1:9)."" - ""These men are those who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted; 13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved FOREVER,"" (Jude 12 - 13) But not only that Jesus says, ""And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the ETERNAL FIRE,"" (Matthew 18:8) Also from the website of https://www.gotquestions.org..., it says, ""Those who are in hell will know that their punishment is just and that they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5)."" And this is exactly true. Deuteronomy 32:3-5 says ""I will proclaim the name of the Lord. Oh, praise the greatness of our God! He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. They are corrupt and not his children; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation."" Now that all from me currently.

Sdc001e17-A2dfdfcef	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"First of all, I came here to argue against the A) view of Hell outlined in the introduction that states specifically, ""souls who do not accept Jesus Christ will go to hell where they are given everlasting conscious torment."" It seems as though you disagree with the thought that all souls who reject Jesus Christ go to Hell, which makes me wonder why you took this debate in the first place. You also seem to be very unclear about what Hell even is, since you have asserted, ""While we humans do not completely know what Hell is like, many of us conclude that Hell is a place where you are disconnected from God."" This view seems to be more compatible with belief B) in the introduction, but I will just assume that you believe that Hell is everlasting conscious torment. If you don""t believe in that, then you should not have taken this debate at all. Although you seem to be taking a position that is different from the one I specifically outlined I would be arguing against, I will still attempt to argue against the idea that it is justified for anyone at all to go to Hell, assuming you believe that Hell is everlasting torment. Rebuttals: 1.""Hell is Not a Punishment"" The definition of punishment: to make someone suffer for a crime or for bad behavior (1)http://www.merriam-webster.com... (1) Hell is a place of everlasting suffering that people are sent to because they have committed a crime (rejecting the Christian God) or have had bad behavior. Hell falls completely in line with the definition of punishment because people are sent there to suffer after committing a crime or bad behavior. There is no way one can twist this to seem like Hell isn't a place of punishment. It's almost like saying prison isn't a punishment. Moreover Hell is the most excessive punishment anyone could ever administer for a finite crime because it goes on forever. The purpose of punishment is usually either to reform bad behavior or to serve as retribution. Since Hell is everlasting, it does not reform bad behavior at all and only serves to make people suffer eternally for their crimes. 2.""People choose to go to Hell"" You assert near the end, ""People may not be purposely asking to go to Hell, it is how they choose to live their own lives."" But in order for people to make a choice about anything, they have to be conscious about exactly what they are choosing. It does not logically follow whatsoever that a woman chose to be raped by a man because she wore revealing clothing. This is because she had no idea that wearing such clothing would trigger such a violent and nefarious act from a man. And furthermore, it does not logically follow that people choose to go to Hell because of rejecting the Christian God when they weren't aware of or didn't believe the consequences. You even admit, ""Let's be honest, no one in this world except Satanists want to go to Hell, even those who do not believe in Hell will admit that it is the last place that they would want to go to."" If people consciously and absolutely knew one action would send them to Heaven or Hell, do you think anyone would choose the action that sends them to Hell? I would say that nobody would except for maybe the most extreme masochist. This example brings up an important distinction: nobody would actually consciously choose Hell over Heaven if they were absolutely aware that they are both real places. But because people aren't consciously aware that a certain action will determine their eternal fate, only 2.18 billion people believe in Christianity and consciously choose one over the other. If people are not aware of or do not believe that they will go to Hell for an action, then it cannot be true that they chose to go to Hell because of that action. 3. ""Anyone can go to Heaven"" A more accurate statement would be: Anyone can go to Heaven while they are living. They cannot however, go to Heaven once they are sent to Hell. There is no reformation system, there are no good deeds one can do, and there are no ways to redeem yourself after you are sent to Hell. You just simply suffer for the rest of eternity. While I think it is nice that you believe that people can go to Heaven by just being good people, the problem is that people cannot go to Heaven by being good people in Hell. There""s no doubt that people would actively be begging God to let them out of Hell or to let them die. Where""s the respect of free will there? Why can""t people prove themselves to be worthy of Heaven after they die? It seems to me like it is an arbitrary and irrational bias. If people live forever in Heaven or Hell, they should always be able to prove themselves worthy of communion with God. Their fates shouldn't be decided by an infinitesimally small portion of their eternal lives when they are on Earth. 5.""We Don""t Exactly Know Who Goes to Hell"" There are a few sentences in this argument that seem to be directly contradicting arguments 2 And 7. 5) ""God, not us, judges who goes to Heaven, Hell or Purgatory."" 5) ""So ultimately, while we may judge people here on earth, the ultimate judge is God."" 2) ""If they go to Hell the fault is not in God, it is in themselves and how they freely chose to live their life."" 7) ""Because God is not involved in Hell there is no way that we can say that He is punishing us"" Obviously God is involved in Hell because it is he alone who decides who goes there. He is the judge in hearing people""s cases and ultimately decides all of it. So since God is obviously the Judge, you must retract your argument that he is not involved in Hell because He decided the whole population of who goes to Hell. 6.""Hell creates a Good Society"" The only reason why Hell would stop people from committing crimes is because of the paralyzing fear of being tortured. One could say that a country has the lowest crime rate in the world, but if it is because they torture people who commit crimes then how can that country be considered moral whatsoever? Hell is an excessive punishment just like torture, and the good effects of threatening people with torture cannot negate the fact that you torture people. As for the story of your friend almost committing suicide, it""s also completely immoral to torture forever a person who was so depressed that they wanted to end their suffering by suicide. I can""t imagine a more insensitive action than torturing someone for eternity because they were suicidal and wanted to end their suffering. 7.""Why Hell is not Immoral"" You assert that god is not involved in Hell whatsoever. Let me list the ways in which he is: 1)He created Hell 2)He decides who goes to Hell 3)He watches and knows everything that goes on in Hell 4)He has the complete power to end people""s suffering by destroying their existence, or giving them a chance to redeem themselves 5)Above all, he chooses not to end the suffering of those who beg and plead with him to end their torment. In conclusion, all of my opponent""s arguments have ultimately been attempts to blame the victim who is suffering in Hell while extricating the offender (God) from any blame whatsoever. But you cannot do that when you realize that Hell is a punishment, people do not choose to go to Hell, and God is involved completely with Hell. It is an irrational and unjustified punishment that deserves no validity among philosophy whatsoever. I hope that Christians come to see that they cannot blame the victim""s of God""s atrocities any longer, and ultimately I hope that Christians come to accept a more reasonable view of Hell such as Annihilationism or Universalism."

S5474d203-A8a60abbb	Hell does not exist	"""As my opponent is the instigator and has taken the Pro position, he/she has the full burden of proof."" This assumption is wrong. To say that hell does not exist is a conclusion based on the fact, that there is literally no proof what so ever, that a place like hell exists. To say it doesn't exist, does therefore not require a burden of proof. Anything that does not exist cannot be proved wrong, but it cannot be proved right either, so the burden of proof is totally irrelevant. Since there is no known evidence that a place like hell exists, it is logical to say that there is no hell. The same argumentation is used every day for all kinds of things. If you friend tells you that you will fall in a pot of soda after you die, is the burden of proof on you, and since you cannot disprove it, is has to be true? The concept of hell is a very contradicting idea too. If there is a god (which I do not believe), who guides everything and created everything, knowing what will happen in the future, he already predetermined, that people will do things that will lead them to hell. Can a person change what is predetermined? No, since that is not possible. Would an all loving God create a place in which people are tortured for all eternity? I think not. Would an all righteous God create a place where people go, who did something insignificant as having sex with the same gender, but no people who commit murder but repent to the lord? I think not. And because the concept of hell is cruel, contradicting to an all loving and righteous God and has no evidence at all, the conclusion that hell is not a real place is just logical."	PRO	52
Sc34e005b-A1d9eec6	Hell is not what you think it is. Pro hell	"Agreed it be unfair for you to rewrite your argument, My Closing statements is this.....""according to what you believe, What you think hell is"" can be broken down in 2 ways. 1. Hell is a place for sinners. 2 God sends people to hell because he created it. 1. i agree hell is for sinners, but the key element is that they can change the outcome. Sinners is someone who is against God, its natural if God doesn't allow them into heaven, can you image walking around In heaven saying hey God I'm against you but thanks for ignoring all the bad things I did and allowing me up here. The good news is that our sins can be washed away, and forgiven, every bad thing you ever did would metaphorically be put in a paper shredder. Once you accept Jesus into your heart, It bridges the gap between us and God even if you sin, you don't take advantage of his grace but 1 john 1:9 ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."" and Isaiah 43:25 ""I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more. 2. God gave us free will, doctors have told patients because they have heart bypass surgery they better start eating better, but many never changed their lifestyle, it seems silly why they wouldn't, I guess some would rather die than change, but this is our human nature, in 2010 auto manufacturers recalled 20million cars for defects, but what's strange is executive directors told owners, because of this, its a free repair get it done. 30% never responded. Likewise many ignore Gods Call unlike the defect in cars the moral defect is not the makers fault he made everything good (Gen 1:31), if God forced us to love him, we would be puppets, devotion is only real when unfaithfulness is possible. Knowing the consequence and then still choosing not to respond, is a choice you make that you could have changed, especially if the gift is free. People send them self to hell, Not God."	PRO	53
S5cf4b640-A2e9bab07	I will go to hell if I murdered 12 people	Sorry, I must have ignored your previous post. Thank you for pointing that out. Please excuse my occasional ignorance. Definitions: Hell - (Christianity) the abode of Satan and the forces of evil; where sinners suffer eternal punishment - a nether world in which the dead continue to exist - the nether realm of the devil and the demons in which the damned suffer everlasting punishment Abode - the place where one abides Nether - situated or believed to be situated beneath the earth's surface Realm - a primary marine or terrestrial bio-geographic division of the earth's surface Sin - transgression of the law of God By using these definitions, we can say that hell is a place of Satan where people who violate the law of God go to suffer eternal punishment beneath the earth's surface. By using the definition of realm, we can say that hell is a physical feature on Earth since the definition states it is a bio-geographical division of the earth's surface. Since it is physical (having material existence, perceptible especially through the senses and subject to the laws of nature), then we must be able to find out where Hell is and be able to see it with our own eyes, or through other senses to know for sure that Hell does exist. Definitions: Satan - the angel who in Jewish belief is commanded by God to tempt humans to sin, to accuse the sinners, and to carry out God's punishment - the rebellious angel who in Christian belief is the adversary of God and lord of evil Angel - an attendant spirit or guardian Spirit - a supernatural being or essence Supernatural - of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible observable universe; especially : of or relating to God or a god, demigod, spirit, or devil Visible - capable of being seen - capable of being discovered or perceived Perceive - to become aware of through the senses From these definitions, we can say that Satan is not visible since he is supernatural. Since he is not visible, he is not capable of being discovered or perceived. Thus, his abode, Hell, is not capable of being discovered or perceived either. Thus, it is impossible to know if Hell is real since we will never be able to discover it. However, this contradicts the statement that Hell is a physical place, since something that is physical has to be perceptible to the senses, when now we know that Hell is indeed not capable of being perceived since we can't become aware of it through the senses. Definitions: Real - existing as a physical entity and having properties that deviate from an ideal, law, or standard Hell is not physical, so it does not exist as a physical entity, even though Hell exists in the minds of the people, it is just simply not real. If somehow I wanted to, I cannot go to Hell even if I murdered 12 people simply because Hell is not real. Good luck Pro.	CON	54
S776b55ae-Abc6ac8a	There is no hell	This is not the end of the Debate. Con has failed to prove that souls can make a choice. How can they possibly make a choice if they are God's creation unless it was the Devil who got into them and surely that was not their choice. Point 1. I never suggested that arguing that God exists is the resolution. And of course your debating to show that God exists was pointless from an arguing point, however it just shows that we have proof. You also stated before you wrote this evidence of God, that it does not effect the debate which was completely correct from arguing point of view. Also, a loving God does prove that there is not a Hell. Example: I shall take this in steps. Step one: God creates the world and humans in it. Step two: The humans think like he wanted them to think with love and kindness Step three: The Opposite to God took over and made humans corrupt. Step four: (only for Christians to believe) Jesus Christ helped the humans and because of him, they are doing more good (step four is not relevant to the debate necessarily, however the other steps are) Conclusion: If we are creations of God, we would not choose against kindness and the rest of his teachings, unless the Devil got into us but if it did, how is that our choice. Therefore there is no Hell that God sends us to. Con has failed to prove against that. So this leaves us to say, if we are only creation then we cannot choose against God unless the Devil got into us but that is not choosing ourselves. So how can Justice be justified in this situation ? And let us say that some Muslim terrorists today, are probably killing many, whilst thinking that they are punishing (doing justice on) those who do not accept them, the amount of suffering is terrible and you are suggesting that this is what loving creator would do to his creation ? Also, just to say that my point was just as relevant to the Debate when proving that God exists then you were. So Con has failed to prove that there is a neutral force the makes us able to choose, or that Hell can be justified or how possibly would a loving creator torture his own people. Point 2. From the points above, I have proved that it is not possible for there to be a Hell, if there was a Hell then how would it have a loving creator sending souls to it, to be tortured, you will have to prove that torture is a just thing to do because any kind of punishment = any kind of torture. Also torture is creating sadness (e.g. Mao, Stalin and Vlad the Impaler) and as far as we know, creating sadness is against God. Con has failed to prove any of these points wrong. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- These are the reasons why not to vote Con: 1. Con has failed to prove that there is a neutral force that makes us able to choose against God 2. Con has failed to justify any torture 3. Con has failed to show how we are able to choose against God 4. Con has failed to show how if God exists, how has he given us a choice.

Sedfad01e-A86dc0be6	The Problem of Evil and Hell	"Theodicy Pro's rebuttal commits the fallacy of high redefinition. [1] He takes our very broad definition of round 1 and cherry picks one attribute in an attempt to show an inconsistency. It is true: God is love. However, it is also true: God is not just love. To say that God is love is to say that He is the standard of love, just as he is the standard of good and just. He is the answer to the question, ""What is love?"" It does not necessitate that God exhibits love and only love in every circumstance. God can be the standard of love even when he chooses not to pardon the wicked. Paul does not say God keeps no records of wrongs in 1 Corinthians 13. Love keeps no records of wrong. Pail implies there is a choice in the matter, especially given the greater context of the chapter. God can practice love or justice and still be the standard of both. Even so, God does erase records of wrongs, not only through the blood of Jesus Christ, but also in the Old Testament in the very same chapter of Ezekiel quoted by Pro himself: But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. (Ezekiel 18:21, ESV) This just shows how badly Pro has taken Ezekiel out of context. God was rebuking the use of a proverb that insisted on the punishment of fathers for their sons' iniquities and vice versa. God was correcting their bad theology, reminding them that everyone is punished for their own sins. The doctrine of original sin, on the other hand, stems from the curse. Is it fair that we all are under Adam's curse? If Adam was in charge of the earth and humanity, then yes. Just as a teenager is unable to take advantage of her driver's license because her brother wrecked the family car, we are unable to avoid sins. Sin is not damaging to just ourselves, it affects all others around us. When I sin, it teaches my children to sin. I sin because I am corrupt. The consequence of sin is that it corrupts my children. Thus, they will sin, and so on. That is the natural consequence of Adam choosing to be his own master. Thanks to Ezekiel I take comfort that God will not irrationally punish my daughters for my sins. Pro also quotes Deuteronomy out of context. This is a book of Israel's laws, prohibiting them from executing sons for their fathers' law breaking and vice versa. This has nothing to do with the character of God whatsoever. This is just poor scholarship on Pro's part. My opponent should apply proper hermeneutics if he wishes to use Christian theodicy to advance his case. The Problem of Hell Pro argues that hell is a punishment disproportionate to the crime and that no amount of finite sins deserves infinite punishment. Per my definition of hell in round one, hell is a ""state of separation from God."" Hell is merely the continuation in the afterlife of one's state in this life. Hell is, by definition, exactly what rebellious sinners are asking for: existence on their own terms, without God. Hell is not out of proportion because it's not about the tally of sins but about the state of rebellion as a whole. The fact that it is eternal is also appropriate since there are two choices for eternity: hell or heaven. If there is only heaven, then God is not just. If there is only hell, then God is not loving. What about the ""lack of evidence?"" The Bible teaches that everyone knows God exists in their heart. Maybe that doesn't meet Pro's standard of justice, but if it meets God's standard, then it matters little. The question is: what makes Microsuck's standard of justice the standard? Fairness is getting no less than what you deserve. Since Adam's revolution against God, we all are separated from God. We are in partial hell even now with God's partial separation. Evil and hell are bedfellows. Both exist because we want to be our own masters. Thus, we all deserve to have what we want for all eternity. So, yes, going to hell is fair for us all. It is grace—indeed, Agape love—that allows even one of us to enter into heaven. God shows abundant charity in inviting rebels into his kingdom. This leaves us with a critical choice. We can complain about how God reigns and reject him based on our fancies about what is just, or we can accept his utterly free gift of Heaven. The Dilemma I agree that if ""good is willed by God because it is good,"" then good is independent of God. However, it is utter fallacy to say that if ""good is good because it is willed be [sic] God,"" then morality loses its objectivity. This reasoning commits the fallacy of equivocation. In P4 Pro writes, ""If 1b is true, then good is contingent and subjective to God's will."" The term subjective here means ""particular to a given person;"" [2] in this case, God. However, in the next premise, the conclusion is that morality is therefore subjective in the philosophical sense, meaning ""existing only as perceived and not as a thing in itself."" The problem here is that Pro completely ignores the fact that anything subjective to God is made objective because He is both universal and invariant. Just because something is subjective to Him does not make it suddenly subjective to the cosmos, especially considering that he transcends our cosmos. Only by accepting Pro's sleight of hand can such conclusions be obtained. Sociobiological Ethics Paul Tobin's exercise in explaining human ethics within the purview of evolution hardly sets the stage for the kind of objective system of morality needed to show that God objectively does not exist. There are four problems with this. First, this ethical system only deals with moral assessment, not moral obligation. The chart shows how fairness, sharing, etc. might have evolved due to social pressures, but absolutely nothing about that chart indicates that one ought to be fair or share. Yet the Problems of Evil and Hell demand a system of objective moral obligation for these arguments to show that God is really unjust. Second, even if we extend this moral system to include some kind of hidden moral obligation such as ""one is morally obligated to advance the social unit,"" it still cannot be applied to the Problems of Evil and Hell because the truth of this moral system is wholly contingent upon the truth of God's existence. If God exists, then Tobin's evolutionary explanation of societal ethics is categorically false. As a result, it begs the question for this debate. Third, this moral system is entirely inadequate. Imagine a poor individual on the brink of starvation who mugs an individual for money. Tobin's ethical system condones the man's behavior because the cost of altruism is too high for the starving man. Even incarceration is not too great a cost because prisoners get three meals a day in the slammer. Yet, in real life, no one would condone the man's behavior. Not the courts. Not society. I daresay, not Microsuck. What we have is an arbitrary moral code that attempts to sidestep the critical issues facing the Problems of Evil and Hell. Fourth, this system focuses on altruism, costs and benefits. But I criticized the Problem of Evil for needing an objective way of determining real unnecessary suffering. Tobin's chart never mentions suffering at all, so Pro has not responded to the most damning evidence against the Problem of Evil. Pro's Burden In the previous round, I argued that Pro needs to objectively demonstrate real unnecessary suffering in order to argue that God really doesn't exist. In this round, I am arguing that he needs to objectively demonstrate that Hell is really unjust and not just some kind of personal opinion on the matter. Until we get real answers to both critical questions, then no amount of pontification over theodicies can save his position.

Sc05807e6-A2471e65c	This House Believes that Hell exists	"I must agree on the fact that the bible is not credible when it comes to the existence of Hell; I said so myself that it wasn't. Unfortunately I have to disagree with there being no evidence period. Even someone that denies that dinosaurs were ever real have to admit that there is a substantial amount of proof on the subject. Philosophically, beliefs from Hinduism being something we can actually see, yes it's evidence for Hell. Hell is on Earth, or is Earth. It needn't have demons that want to rip us all to shreds, when we do such a fine job of that to each other in things as brutal as wars, or something as small as pushing someone out of the way on the sidewalk. Many people have had the pleasure of riding in some sort of moving vehicle, right? Well that vehicle is an instrument being used to get to a certain destination or objective. Applying that type of logic to a ""soul"" would mean the body is just an instrument we're using to get to a destination or objective, as well. Which could possibly be a ""better"" place (such as a Christian heaven). Now, on the matter of a physical Hell I'm afraid Christianity (or science fiction novels) are not the only things to be considered religion. I don't want to seem patronizing, so please don't take it that way, but there are other beliefs out there such as Buddhism, Sikhism, or what I'm using for the debate, Hinduism, etc. As I stated earlier on, there needn't be demons. There needn't be fiery lakes of doom and gloom. There needn'tt be western devils or Japanese onis. And I do not speak metaphorically when I say Hell exists, because based upon your very on definition It's a place where the souls of ""bad"" people are believed to be punished after death, especially in the Christian and Muslim religions. And what better place to be tortured than on the Earth, where cruelty is abundant and in fact, eternal, as you stress? Such as the acts of genocide in WW2 in Germany, or even presently in Darfur, Sudan. But if you're really set on lakes of eternal fire as a depiction of Hell, then never fear. We have the Tambora volcano, which has been killing with ""lakes of fire"" since 1815. Or perhaps Mount Rokatenda, and so on. I am not an eyewitness to the Holocaust. I am not an eyewitness to the horrors committed in Libya, or areas of South Africa, or the creation of stars light years away. But to say I do not believe in something simply because I haven't seen it with my own eyes would be ridiculous. I know that corrective rape happens in Southern Africa. I know that homosexuals and transgender/transsexuals are persecuted in Russia. I know that Detroit is suffering an economic decline. And all of that is not a product of ""faith"". All of those things have evidence. And so yes, I agree that on the matter of a claim being made but not having an ounce of proof behind it can easily be dismissed. However, Hell does have evidence of being real. Perhaps not in the way previous human beings have pictured, but it certainly has proof. I thank you for the round, and apologize for my reply taking so long. You stumped me rather good for a bit.

Namely, That it's a place where God sends those who go against the commands and restrictions shown in the Bible. I'd like to state before we begin that even though I'm an athiest, I'm not adding ""fictional"" anywhere in what I define Hell to be. I'm debating based on what I believed Hell to be based on when I was a Christian. Opening Statement: My main argument for this case is that Hell is where God sends you if went against the Commands, Restrictions, or other guidelines listed in the Bible as punishment for not listening to God's word. As my opponent is both the Pro and the Instigator, the Burdenof Proof lies upon him to prove that Hell is not actually what I think it is. THerefore, if Pro cannot prove that Hell is not where God sends sinners, then I win the round. I will now back up my position with a few Bible Verses: Psalm 9:17 “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” Luke 10:15 “And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.” Luke 12:5 “But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.” 2nd Peter 2:4 “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment…” These quotes show that the ""wicked"", in this case meaning sinners, are sent to Hell, thus confirming that Hell is in fact what I think it is, and so the resolution is negated. I would list more, but the 2,000 character limit is a little restricting. Questions: 1.) Would you say that your opening statement is focused around the fact that Hell is not used as a scare tactic, rather than focusing around the resolution? 2.)

However, this does not demonstrate that there is not a thing out there which these ideas and concepts represent. The fact that you cannot hear, see, or touch hell does not demonstrate that it isn't a part of reality. It could be beyond your ability to sense. Humans can only see a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum [1]. Similarly, we can only hear a portion of the total range of frequencies [2]. The senses of touch, taste, smell, and balance are necessarily related to how close you are to an object, so they are irrelevant in the detection of a hell unless you are near to it. The bottom line is that your failure to sense a hell does not mean that a hell does not exist. As Pro, you claimed that, ""there is no such thing as hell."" You have not demonstrated that claim, and on more than one occasion, have tried to shift the burden to me. I had no burden to prove that a hell existed, only to show you that you could not claim that it doesn't. [1] http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu... [2] https://en.wikipedia.org..."	CON	60
S63d14e3c-Ae49730b9	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	"I will object 2 points that were made by Pro and come to my conclusion. 1) -Pro states: Acts24:15-""""And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."" If there is hell fire, why will God resurrect the unjust ? Answer: God will resurrect the unjust so he they be punished it as simple as that since our soul is immortal. And by using this argument Pro just did concede that the unjust will not be annihilated. Thus, he contradicts himself it seems that he is just using passage of the bible to deny hell as opposed to having a coherent view on the afterlife. -Pro seems to confuse the particuliar judgement that is after the death of every human being and the general judgement at the end of time. -Pro also seems to confuse the temporary place were just/good people were staying before Jesus Christ died on the cross since the gate of heaven were closed before the sacrifice of the christ 2) Pro then argues that hell was a manipulation tactic made by catholic church to live in fear: Pro also states that it has bring people to leave church. - What was the interest of the catholic church to afraid people if they didn't honestly believe that hell was true ? - You can see that a lot of catholic saints were genuinely affraid of hell and so they didn't preach on the dangers of going to hell just for power, success obviously - You can see that what made people leave the church is the fact that the catholic church got more liberal and less harsh in his teaching. For proof you can see that after Vatican 2 council mass attendance has dropped significantly. - The fact that there were inner debates in the catholic church before nicaea council with opposition on the idea of eternal hell such as Origene is indeed a proof that catholic church imposed this view with the contradictory principle thus showing that the debate procedure was respected. Conclusion. Pro made a lot of contradiction. Stating bad people are dead in the afterlife yet resurrected for instance. You can see the problem when people want to do their own version of christianity and ignore the roman catholic church teaching. Pro didn't answer my request about for instance the fact that other bible passage of Jesus teaching talks about an eternal punishment without refering to the contested word hell. I will admit that I didn't argue back on pro Old scriptures reference since I find that new scriptures that are direct word of god has overwhelming evidence on the hell subject. I will conclude by saying that even if hell doctrin is sometime hard to admit it is a point of faith that everybody should have. People that believe in hell are sometime criticized by people that say that they live in fear. But it makes me wonder who really lives in fear the one that admit a truth or someone that will make up a lot of excuses just to hide from it ? Hell is a real place and everybody in this earth should do everything to avoid it. Believing in hell prevent you from sinning and that is a good thing. Vote Con. Pro gloria Dei."	CON	61

S357cd8ff-Aaa3f0f78	Hell is not a Bible teaching	"First of all, your argument that the definition means eternal punishment in a fire is not the lake of fire is a mute point, and very petty, nevertheless, allow me to prove to you that hell is not misinterpreted, and is very much so a lake of fire where all those who do not know Christ will go. Argument #1: ""The lake of fire is mentioned in the bible, and there for it IS biblical, very much so"" The word hell is translated from several different words. The Hebrew word is Sheol which means ""pit"" Numbers 16:33 ""So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly."" Greek: gehenna (from the Hebrew Valley of Hinnom)Translated “hell” meaning place of everlasting torment Matthew 10:28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Read more: http://www.whatchristianswanttoknow.com... Revelation 19:20, ""And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."" These scriptures above as well as their grammatical origins prove your statement is false, and if you need more information, follow the link I posted which was one of my sources, besides the bible of course. Argument #2: The core of the Earth is Hell Scientists in Siberia drilled into the core of the Earth, and it they recorded the cries from the lake of fire below the Earth known as the core. Amos 9:2 proves it is possible to dig into hell, and this was very possibly a prophecy for this event: it reads: ""“Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, whence I bring them down.” If you look at the second sentence of the verse and remember the tower of Babel, then you know it is not symbollically suggest they climb up to heaven but it is speaking in literal terms. Therefore, if the second part of the verse was not symbolism rather a literal statement, then one has to suggest that the first part of the verse talking about digging into hell is literal as well. I will provide a summary of the article but I suggest my opponent as well as the voters to copy and paste the below URL and read the entire article before placing your votes, or your opposing argument. A Scientists and crew dug to the core, getting closer then anyone had before. The DR. in charge of the drilling came back with a sound clip off the crying souls his team and he had heard, and his telling of the event is bone chilling. The sound clip was investigated by the top scientists in signapore said their results were inconclusive. Of coures, they say the Doctor and his team could have falsified the findings using fake voices, but if you read the article you will be able to discern the truth for yourself. https://hellandheaventestimonies.wordpress.com... Even if you don't buy the story of the doctor and his team hearing the souls of hell on their mission to the core, this point is real more substantial then anything as far as the point goes. The argument was the hell is not biblical. The first argument I posed in this post was a direct response that disproved his point. EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE OR ITS PRINCIPLES, this is not the issue here. The issue is rather or not a lake of fire/hell is IN THE BIBLE i.e. is it biblical? the answer is yes, it is in the bible. That's just a fact. Rather you worship Jesus or Budha, you still can't deny the lake of fire's presents in the bible of Christianity."	CON	64

S3a24f2e9-A16de1499	Hell does not exist.	Hello there, Mr Matt_L. Owen is a little busy with work and thus, has given me the opportunity to debate with you on the motion of whether Hell exists or not. I'm pleased to accept the challenge :) Now, I have read the above arguments posted and I must say that both of you did not stay on the topic of the debate itself. Both of you were arguing about whether God is evil or not. Both of you were arguing on the basis/assumption that hell does exist and therefore, started arguing about the reasons as to why a loving God would send non-believers to hell. This is not the subject of this debate. We are discussing on whether Hell exists in the first place or not. Whether or not the reasons for sending a person to hell are legitimate is completely irrelevant to this debate and thus, we should really get back on topic. Now, before we move on, let us be clear of who the Burden of Proof is on. The people who claim that Hell exists are usually religious folks who claim that if a person does not follow the rules of their religion, they will go to hell. Though Owen is skeptical and claims that Hell does not exist, the idea of Hell, originally, was from religious people and therefore, the Burden of Proof is upon you to give evidence as to why there is a Hell where humans will be tortured for all eternity. Let's get started, shall we? My first and main substantive for this debate would be entitled Evidence. Currently, there has been no evidence whatsoever for the existence of hell. Evidence is defined as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. There has been no such evidence whatsoever which can indicate that the belief in a Hell is true or valid. If there is some evidence on your part, please state it here with links to different websites so that I can easily cross-check the information. Now, the normal response to this would be that the Bible is evidence that Hell is real. Well, the validity of the Bible is questionable in itself, since there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that anything in the Bible is of any historical value. If there is any evidence to prove that the events in the Bible are true, please indicate them here, again with links so that I can cross-check the evidence and information My second substantive will be entitled Physical Implications. Whether Hell is a place of torture or a place of love and kindness is completely irrelevant. That's a debate for another day. But it must be physical. It must be a part of this Universe and therefore, must be composed of matter. Fires need fuel so there must be an infinite amount of oxygen in order to fuel the eternal lakes of fires of Hell, scientifically speaking. Therefore, Hell must be a part of the Universe. However, as funny as it may sound, Scientists have been unsuccessful in detecting any sort of physical place which has lakes of eternal fires or anything of that sort. You might say that the place might be invisible to us. However, even if a certain place is individual, as it is composed of matter, it must have some sort of effect on the Universe and if there were lakes of eternal fire in Hell, we would see some of their effects on the Universe around us. So far, we have not been able to see any of these effects on the Universe. We know this because we have traced all of the phenomenon to stars and galaxies. We've traced back supernovas to exploding stars and black holes to stars collapsing on their own gravity. Again, this is related to the evidence but you must provide evidence which is scientifically-based and must obey the laws of physics and mechanics. For my third and last argument, there have been no eyewitnesses for the horrors of Hell. It really is hard to describe what you have not seen, felt or experienced. So, how can you describe Hell based upon a book or a few books written by peasants who did not know where the rain came from? How can you describe Hell on the basis that it is a place for torture only because a holy book tells you that it is? Do not trust everything that a book tells you to trust. Even if you do trust it, test out what the book claims before making your own conclusions. This is a basic principle in science as well as philosophy. I don't always trust things in my Physics textbook, though I love Science and Math, and I always ask my teachers to show me evidence. They always succeed in showing me evidence which makes me accept whatever the book says. So, before you decide to go believing a book like the Bible or any religious scripture of any religion, please try to search for evidence. By seeing the evidence, you learn to accept the facts and move on. But if there is no evidence of something, it cannot be accepted without peer review and a large amount of external scrutiny. I shall wait for your reply and I shall answer all of your substantives. Please try to type out each point under one paragraph so I can easily answer to each of your points. Thank you very much and have a good day :)	PRO	66

But yes My Opening argument objectively hints at the fact I was arguing that Hell is Not a fear tactic, and Pro for the the fact that it is not, being aware that it can be used that way, but advocate that, it is not the way it is to be used or the proper use for it. ""Would you say Sinners don't neccesarily go to Hell?"" Sinners do go there according to my belief, but everyone can be saved, but have to make the choice, but in the end my answer also furthers your point if I cant refute that hell is NOT what you thought it was, which was i line with mine, then I inevitably lose, based on that being the argument I was ACTUALLY trying to covey, But based on my Opening, it is argued for the fact that hell is not a fear tactic, I don't Know if I'm allowed to present this argument as the main one.

Sc34e005b-A88ae6b36	Hell is not what you think it is. Pro hell	"Rebuttal: ""No rebuttals for your verses because my belief is in line with your presented case, except for the fact that God does Not purposely send them to hell, some verses you listed refer to a specific group of people when he says send, but ultimately because they chose to be wicked they ultimately sent them self"" It would seem that the Con actually agrees with the Pro's case, exept for the fact that God does not send them to Hell, but - metaphorically - they send themselves. However, regardless, God has to make the decision to send them to Hell for their sins. He decides that those who have sinned cannot enter Heaven because sin cannot bear to be around him. Because God made the conscious decision to not allow sinners into heaven and instead send them to hell, Hell is indeed what I think it is. Answers: Q1: The last part of this question is a little confusing, but from what I think it means, I'd say that the only benefit we humans have from believing our loved ones are in danger of going to Hell (remember that Hell was not created for our benefit) would be to do their best to keep their family members from sin, so God will not have to send them there. Q2: Although I'm unsure of whether or not God created Hell himself (there are several theological debates on this), if he did do so, it would likely be as a place to punish Satan and the other fallen angels, from what I know of the scripture."

Pro hell	"Thanks for your patience, because of the forfeit this could damage votes, but what's done is done, life events and I could not get here in time for previous round, my apologies. I feel the debate has changed flow, to actually refute What you think something is, is tricky because one cannot change what someone else thinks, they must change on their own but we can influence. As I mentioned before my intended argument was not literally ""Hell is not what you think it is"" that was just a title for my debate, but not the actual debate, in my opening argument after giving many examples it hinted at the fact Hell is not used as a fear tactic, so when my title says Hell is not what you think it is, it was just a opening hook and not my argument, because traditionally people who don't understand the purpose of hell see it as a fear tactic. ""Because God made the conscious decision to not allow sinners into heaven and instead send them to hell, Hell is indeed what I think it is."" If God let Sinners into heaven, then anyone could do what they wanted with no consequences here on earth and still get to heaven, that's not justice and this would mean God didn't care what people do, but he does. 2 peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."" God Created Hell but people have free will, they can Choose between options. He doesn't send them, as I mentioned in the example, if Jesus was in a life boat reaching out to save you but you refused, he created the water that drowned you, but you only drowned because you didn't take the free chance to get saved. Just because the water can kill God is not responsible if someone chose to stay in it. So he does not Send them if that's what you think, it is a personal choice that can be changed if they wanted. Questions. Do you personally think Hell is a Fear tactic? If it is not then what else could it be?"	PRO	70
Sb6c5e646-A39605f31	Faith is real	"Pro is ""Faith is real"". Con is supposed to argue that faith is not real. The first supporting argument for ""faith is real"" was ignored by Con. Typing my debate round in belief that I will be able to post my remarks for the round after i am finished typing is an act of faith. Faith is real. Con is acting by faith the same as me here. To say there is no faith while typing in faith believing the comments will be posted after the post button is pushed is self-contracictory. Here is another example of the reality of faith proven in action. When you sit in a chair, do you examine the chair to prove it can support your weight before you sit down, or do you sit down believing the chair will hold you without examining it? Sitting in a chair, believing it will support you, is an act of faith. Faith is real. We all act by faith. Atheists are allowed to spell the word ""allowed"" as ""aloud"" in faith that the reader will get the intented meaning by understanding the context. Also, they are allowed to type so they can convey words in righting rather than aloud by voice. When a person uses the wrong word and believes the reader will understand the meaning correctly, it's an act of faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It's real. We prove that faith is real by our actions. Atheists prove their faith in no punishment from God by doing things God would not approve of and not saying sorry to God. Then their death sentence is finalized, and their faith fails. Many people act in faith following lies....misguided faith. Islam is a good example of people who act in faith following lies.......strong faith even to the point of murder/suicide............

Also, accepting your definition, you would still need to prove that hell does not exist within earth, this would mean you need to check every-location at every depth at the same time (it might move to trick us). we have not yet penetrated the earth's crust, the outer most layer, so we cannot say, with absolute certanty, that it does not exist within the earth, therefore you have yet to meet your burden of proof.

"""Pro argues that I asserted without evidence that God is omniscient and morally perfect, but that is part of the very definition of God; any being who isn't omniscient and morally perfect can""t be God. What""s more, if he demands that I prove God has these qualities, would that not be a subject for a different debate? Pro, are we debating the morality of hell on the assumption that God exists, or are we debating the morality of hell AND the question of whether or not God exists?"" A major point I have been trying to make in this debate is that not only is Hell immoral and unjust, but it is also completely incompatible with a loving and just God. Nowhere in this debate did I make the assumption that God is morally perfect and simultaneously chooses to send people to hell. I wouldn't even attempt to argue for my side if we had assumed that. It would be a non-sequitur for me to argue that God is morally perfect and sends people to Hell, and that Hell is immoral. Rather I have attempted to prove that if there is a morally perfect and omniscient God, he wouldn't do something as irrational and immoral as torturing a person forever for not loving him. Instead of addressing the substance of my arguments, Con has repeatedly appealed to authority and said that I am only a mere human who cannot question God. So I state again: any and all arguments from authority should be considered invalid in this debate. If you appeal to authority again, Con, I can only assume that it is an attempt to sidestep providing logical and moral reasons for why Hell is just. ""Now Pro claims torturing someone for not loving you is immoral. How do you decide what is moral and what is not? This is an emotional argument, not a logical one. Because you don""t like it, then it""s wrong. You make your own feelings the measure of justice and truth. But if God attaches greater importance to loving him than he does to your personal happiness, what is it that makes him wrong for doing so?"" Any emotional arguments I have employed have been attempts to appeal to empathy and compassion, things that I think are essential components in moral decisions. But just like empathy and compassion, proper use of logic is also essential to arriving at the right conclusion that will reduce suffering. So, I will examine the ways in which Hell is illogical. The purpose of punishment is usually to reform the criminal""s behavior so that they will not commit the crime again. The punishment must not be too soft nor severe, or else the criminal will slip back into negative behaviors and continue to commit crimes and supposed sins against God. Con has freely admitted that when people are in Hell, they come to despise God for what he""s done to them. This in turn makes it so that they are much more sinful than they were before, constantly cursing God for torturing them without end. If Hell is really God""s plan to eliminate sin, then he is an absurdly incompetent deity. God could actually eliminate sin by annihilating their existence or forgiving them, but instead he chooses to perpetuate sin in this way. In this way, we can see that Hell neither teaches the victim a lesson nor rehabilitates their behavior. So what logical reason could God possibly have for torturing people for all of eternity? Hell doesn't teach people a lesson, doesn't reform their behavior, doesn't stop them from sinning, and most importantly inhumanely tortures the victim for all of eternity. The only logical reasons for God to torture them would be to inflict retribution or to satisfy his own sadism. But you cannot logically justify the idea that never ending torture is fair retribution for choosing the wrong God to worship. The only victim in the ""crime"" of choosing the wrong God would be God. Do you really think he would be so vindictive and hateful to torture the person rather than forgive them for making a mistake? The one and only reason for why God would logically choose to torture someone forever for not loving him would be to satisfy his own vengeful sadism. Since sadism is not compatible with a morally perfect God, we can conclude that God would never choose to torture anyone eternally. ""Pro thinks that if God appeared to all mankind that 98% of them would become Christians. They would become theists, but that doesn't show they will become Christians."" Okay, let""s say that the number of people who become real Christians doesn't actually jump up to 98 percent. If just one single person were to become a real Christian because of God revealing himself, wouldn't that be a success? But I think that we can assume that a massive amount of people would become real Christians if God were to give compelling and conclusive evidence. So why doesn't he? Why doesn't he give conclusive evidence to non-believers who are searching through this lottery of 10,000 religions? It""s just simply illogical to base people""s eternal fates on a bet they made in a lottery. ""I wonder, do you think that rejecting your claim that hell is unjust is an ""understandable mistake"" on my part? I doubt you do, because you made the information available to me. And God has made the information about himself available to the whole world not just in the Bible, but by sending missionaries, using TV broadcasts, the internet, tracts, and even visions and dreams, and conscience."" Rejecting the claim that Hell is unjust is an understandable mistake in the sense that you do not deserve to be tortured eternally for it. Much like believing that Hell is moral does not warrant you to be tortured eternally, choosing the wrong version of God to believe does not warrant eternal torture either. Just because I made the information available to you does not mean that I get to torture you for being wrong. ""where do these moral values we apprehend come from? Well, it is only because an eternal being (God) has always existed, that such moral values exist, and God prefers these values because they are part of his very nature. It is because God is loving that love is objectively good, it is because God is just that justice is objectively good. And these moral values were not invented by God; so God didn""t arbitrarily decide to make any action morally right or wrong."" Logic and empathy is and always has been the source of morality. Even if there is a God, then he prefers certain moral values because of logic and empathy. You have said that God does not arbitrarily choose what is right and wrong, so I assume he must use logic and empathy to arrive at the right moral conclusion. I've said it before and I will say it again: might does not make right. If you assert that the only way we can have objective morality anywhere is by having an omnipotent deity, then you are again falsely equating power with morality. Why would it logically follow that a universe without God has no morality? Would the presence of an omnipotent deity somehow make morality objective and valid? If you think that morality comes from authority, the only reason why people should logically behave morally would be out of threat of punishment and bribe of reward. If the collective mass""s goal is to keep suffering to a minimal level, then there is always a right and objective answer to moral questions. The presence of a deity doesn't change that. And furthermore, Hell is a definitive case of injustice that tortures people without end for making the wrong bet. And just because many people have been wrong about morality throughout history does not mean that humans can""t come to the right conclusion. We have been wrong about so many different scientific theories, but that doesn't mean that we will never arrive at a correct scientific theory. It only means that the problem is complex and difficult. Occasionally, we get the right answer to these difficult problems. Just like science, there is a correct moral decision in every case that will offer the least amount of suffering to parties involved. Moral decisions are difficult, but the right decision exists independent of human opinion and God. If one has no empathy however, then there would be no logical reason for them to reduce the suffering of other""s except for their own benefit. Morality stems off of suffering and empathy. ""How do you know, that a being with infinitely more wisdom and knowledge than you, could not have reasons unknown to you, why he created hell in the first place? How can a speck of dust in this vast universe argue with God as if we comprehend his outworking of the bigger picture."" Con""s argument here is basically saying God has a reason; it""s just hidden from us! Instead of providing any actual reasons for why people should be tortured, Con has asserted many times that we just have to trust God even though he doesn't give us reasons. I hope I don""t have to explain why this is absurd. In conclusion: Hell is unjust and immoral because it tortures people for eternity based on a bet they made in the lottery of religions when the answer was unclear and obscure. It is also an irrational punishment that would undoubtedly make the victim more sinful, psychotic, and hateful towards God. There is no logical reason for why God would do this except to satisfy his own sadistic and evil desires to torture people. God could offer them some way of redemption, but instead he chooses to confine people to an infinitely harsh punishment. Unfortunately, the only reason I have learned of why Con believes in this is because he asserts that God is morally perfect and chooses to send people to Hell, so sending people to Hell must be a moral action. If Con cannot present any reasons for why this should happen that doesn't reference God's authority and moral perfection, then I must assume that he has no reason outside of that. So Con, provide objective and logical reasons for why Hell is a fair punishment for people choosing the wrong religion. And please, don't appeal to authority. Thanks to all who have read this, and thank you to Con."	PRO	74

There argument that one has not experienced something is not a valid arguement for something to not exisst. It just means that it has YET to exist in my limited perseption of reality. 2) There has been plenty of evidents of hell existing in others prespections People in coma's speak of an afterlife. Multiple relegions from differnt cultures and regions mention it. Scientest and mathmaticians have worked on eveidence to prove the exisince of god, or at least the possibility. 3) Pascals Wager 4) Concepts of hell. I will go into more detail in the next round.

Sc34e005b-Adfbf440a	Hell is not what you think it is. Pro hell	"Although this was a fairly interesting topic and one I haven't been able to debate in the past, however the arguments were fairly simplistic. I'll address the two points my opponent brought up (as my opponent has effectively designed these so that they cover the entire argument), and show how they cannot prove that my idea of Hell isn't what I think it is. 1.) Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing that one who sins will never be able to get into heaven, by ""sinners"" I mean those who have been judged by St. Peter at the pearly gates and weren't able to be let in because their sins were too great. As that's what I was talking about, this point doesn't really do anything. 2.) My opponent's second point deals with the metaphorical sending dealing with free will, however this point simply doesn't hold up. This is because although we do choose to sin, we don't literally throw ourselves into Hell. After our sins are judged by St. Peter, and if we aren't allowed into Heaven, we are sent to Hell by God to keep us from tainting Heaven (this point was made last round and was completely dropped by my opponent, so according to debating rules it is considered true). And so, even though we do have free will, because we don't literally choose to walk into Hell, we have to be sent. And because we have to be sent to Hell by God, the resolution is negated as I have proven that Hell is indeed what I think it is, which means my opponent's BoP cannot be upheld."	CON	76

"Your argument is sole based on an individual experience, however that is a ""2 Dimentional View of reality"" What I mean is if YOU do not experience it does not exist, however reality is made up of everyone's experience not just your perception. For example I am typing on a Keyboard in texas. I am eating some noodles. since the words are meaningless to you because you cannot experience it first hand. My statement is a lie thus not possible and does not exist. However If you flew here right now you would experience that the beleif is not a lie infact I do exist.

That does not make sense, and so does your arguementagainst hell. the inability to prove something does not exist does not logically disprove it's existiance because you have not experienced it.

S39c285af-Ae12321f	"Homosexuals Are Not Going to ""Hell""."	"So, according to the Bible, you are not to have ""sexual relations"" with someone of the same gender as that is detestable. There are other areas where the Bible mentions sex between two homosexuals and whatnot, but I'll focus on the most important part, in which the Bible blatantly states that homosexuality is wrong. Let's pretend that God exists. He says homosexuality is wrong, therefore making it a sin. It is then placed alongside other supposed sins such as cheating, lying, committing adultery, whatever actions God has deemed impure (this is laughable in my opinion, but I digress.) So, homosexuality is a sin. Great. What makes it any different from other sins? According to God, if you repent for your sins, you'll be forgiven for them and won't have to go to ""Hell"". Just because homosexuality wasn't mentioned in the Ten Commandments doesn't mean homosexuality wouldn't be a sin. Since homosexuality would be a sin, as long as you repent for it, then you're all taken care of. It's extremely unfair and pointless on God's part, seeing as people have to ask for forgiveness on something they didn't even get a say in, but again, I digress. By the logic that if you are homosexual you will go to ""Hell"", that means we're all going to this ""Hell"". Homosexuality is no different than other sins, and not one person on this planet is perfect. If homosexuals are going to ""Hell"" for sinning, then heterosexuals are, too. Everyone is."	PRO	86
S12263bbe-A20e350a6	hell is rules and limitations of god etc	"Observation 1: Since my opponent doesn't support such a ludicrous claim as ""hell is rules and limitations of god etc."" I win this round. You can't make a claim like that and not support it. That's like me saying ""aliens are real because space is big"" but if I don't support such a claim or prove how there are possible regions that provide life its just a claim. Simply said he made a claim nothing more. Observation 2: My opponent literally says ""show me why I am wrong Con"" but he hasn't shown us viewers why his position is right therefore I win the round even if I provided nothing since I stated my position and what I am talking about. He hasn't provided something to back up his view point and by round 3 you are not allowed to provide a case or information so I win either way. Rather then providing a case, since I have won this round I will simply enlighten my viewers just for an education on hell and some godly principles. I hope you guys learn something. I will respond to his statement as well but yeah nothing too serious. The devil was an angel before as many know. However he wasn't just an angel he was the gods chief angle. But as stated in revelations chapter 12 And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. Now lets focus on his statement ""hell is rules and limitations of god, so not following the rules and limitations of god means there is no hell"" This is not true in fact hell is a real location but since its spiritual based we can't see it. Spiritual things cannot be seen with the eye like demons and such. Mathews 25 Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. SO yes the first destination for a sinners hell and it is a real thing not a concept that only is applicable to believers in god like my opponent seems to suggest. Obviously people that commit murder and worship sprints and dark arts do not believe in god yet they are mentioned in this scripture. Also revelations 21:8 states this But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."" The lake of fire is the ultimate death that is applicable to any individual. IF you actually magnify the meaning of the statement made by my opponent made ""hell is rules and limitations of god, so not following the rules and limitations of god means there is no hell"" he is implying the following things. 1. By not believing in god or following his rules you exonerate yourself from the punishment of hell. EX: Basically I could say I don't believe that jails are real or they are an illusion and jials don't exist for me as an individual. I read a book called the intro to skeptical Philosophy and they at least had layouts and guidelines to support big philosophical claims. This one has none that make it applicable or realistic. Also we can look to this scripture Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became living soul. Conclusion: Since god made humans that means his rules are applicable to any individual regardless of belief. I like my opponents attempt at being some modern day Socrates or Plato by making some philosophical claim but it's not supported and just some poor observation. NOw we must look at the most popular rules established in the bible The 10 commandments 1.You shall have no other gods before Me. 2.You shall not make idols. 3.You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. 4.Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 5.Honor your father and your mother. 6.You shall not murder. 7.You shall not commit adultery. 8.You shall not steal. 9.You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 10.You shall not covet. A lot of these are rules that even the world itself applies to individuals, thus even if you don't believe in god many of these limitations established in the bible are used today anyway which disproves his theory that limitations don't exist even if you don't believe in god. The world itself says you can't murder and steal therefore godly principles are applicable in society regardless of belief. The god of choices In the bible god says he will have supreme control on heaven, let the devil and his demons maintain hell and humans mold and shape earth. God lets us have earth because he wants us to choose. God doesn't believe in forcing people which shows another nice quality of him. He wants us to choose him in heaven but he offers us hell/sin as well. God is a god of choices and one reason he is because he wants us to behave the same way. God wants us as humans to try to influence and get people to follow god but he doesn't want us to force them to. Conclusion: God could choose to eliminate sin and satan and he could choose to force us all to be Christians but instead he chooses to allow the freedom of choice. God has the ability to do anything he made the earth,, he made heaven, and he made hell so yes he has supreme control. Also god wouldn't make something that could overtake him he obviously has supreme wisdom to make what he has made today. It's amazing that he could do such things but yeah god can do anything he has no limitations."	CON	87
S393ece2c-A8dfab813	The Problem of Hell Redux	"Thanks to Con for accepting the debate. Just to make clear the commitments of the traditional (eternal, conscious torment) doctrine of hell I'll use Jonathan Kvanvig's explication: The Anti-Universalism Thesis: Some persons are consigned to hell; The Existence Thesis: Hell is a place where people exist, if they are consigned there; The No Escape Thesis: There is no possibility of leaving hell and nothing one can do, change, or become in order to get out of hell once consigned there; The Retribution Thesis: The justification for hell is retributive in nature, hell being constituted to mete out punishment to those whose earthly lives and behavior warrant it. [1] The Proportionality Objection Obviously, this view of hell is heavily based upon the retributive theory of punishment in moral philosophy. [2] Hell, after all, on this view, is not for redeeming the damned nor is it for deterring other bad actions. It's for retribution; it's because they deserve to be punished. In fact, this is where the doctrine gets most of it's legs or intuitional support from. The basic idea is that God is a just (among other attributes like holy, good, loving, and the like) God and therefore has to punish sinners in hell for their unethical actions here on earth in the after life. Before even getting into proportionality objection there seems to a deep, fundamental problem - even incoherence - with saying that a loving, merciful God 's sense of justice requires (as many do) him to damn some eternally as philosophers Eric Reitan and John Kronnen have pointed out. [3] Christian theology has always maintained that every single of one us deserves hell because we all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Now, why isn't it the case that all of us will go to hell? Because it is said that God will take mercy and show grace to at least some of us and that is because Christ took on our punishments for sins and this was accomplished through the atonement. But, then, how is it supposed to be the case that God's justice requires him to damn some. Obviously it doesn't - so why would God's justice get in the way of showing mercy and love to all of his people and not sending them to a place to be eternally in torment? Obviously this would undermine the ""anti-universalism thesis"", giving us reason not to assent to that that thesis. That worry aside, the very theory of punishment the doctrine draws upon actually gives us strong reason to reject the existence of hell when placed alongside the Christian God. One can easily see how wholly disproportionate this whole scenario is. On retributivism the punishment is supposed the match the nature of the crime. If the punishment is too harsh it is unethical. Likewise, if the punishment is too lenient it is also unethical. Now, how could a finite person ever do something to warrant an infinite punishment? This seems to be a case of being far, far, far too harsh. The math does not not add up. Finite person + finite crime = infinite punishment? Even using paradigm cases of the worst that humanity has ever had to offer - say, Hitler - what he did can't ever merit an infinite, eternal punishment. Even if he gets tortured 4 quadrillion years for every person his genocidial policies affected how does that merit an infinite punishment? At some point this just punishment turns into cruelty and torture and something akin to a twisted sense of sadism. Punishing for no reason is not just. Thus, this argument seems to show that very foundation that the doctrine of hell raises is very shaky indeed; it even seems to refute it. So this undermines the ""retribution thesis"". The Bliss of the Saved Objection On any remotely orthodox Christian understanding of heaven it is said to be a place of unimaginable bliss and joy and happiness. This process is viewed as the pinnacle of sanctification - in other words - since our goal in this life (and maybe some more in the next) is to be Jesus-like or God-like. In heaven, people are sin-less, and thus more like God. Now, one of THE defining elements of God is love in Christianity. [4] One could easily surmise that in heaven the saved would have a God-like all abiding love for everyone as God seems to have. If that is the case, the presence of people being in a state of eternal torment seems fundamentally incompatible with the redeemed in heaven being in a state of unimaginable bliss. What loving person can truly be happy while their loved ones are suffering much less suffering forever in unimaginable pain and anguish. In fact, Paul himself seems to lend credence to this argument. [5] If Paul was that anguished over just considering the fate of his people, how much more would the saved and redeemed and sanctified be anguishing over actually knowing that all of their loved ones are burning in hell? It's often noted then when two people love each other anything that happens to one automatically effects the other. If one is suffering the other suffers too because they hate to see their loved one suffering. Or vice versa. Consider the old adage, ""It makes me happy just to see you happy"". If that is just earthly love, it should be infinitely greater in heaven. With this in mind seems that one has to give way. The saved could not be in the ultimate state of blissfulness and happiness all the while knowing that those loved ones are suffering eternally. This presents another strong reason to reject the traditional doctrine of hell that is conceived of as eternal, conscious torment. If hell as conceived exists, then heaven as conceived does not. Or, conversely, if heaven as conceived exists, then hell as conceived does not exist. I think the latter proposition has stronger warrant. To Con.

Sdc001e17-A1b748408	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"The concept of Hell has been confused as seen by my opponent. 1. Hell is Not a Punishment What is Hell? Hell is not a place but a state. Unlike previous times many Christian scholars today do not view Hell as eternal torment or fire. In fact it is worse than that. While we humans do not completely know what Hell is like, many of us conclude that Hell is a place where you are disconnected from God. In Hell you are not exposed by God's powerful love like you constantly are here on earth. God loves everyone, including those who do not believe in Him but Hell is a devastating place, not of fire and brimstone but of a Godless dimension. This is not a punishment but a place where people have rejected God and so they are not in communion with Him. Even atheists are surrounded by God, He surrounds all of us everyday. He loves us so much without you even knowing it and it is fantastic for you and I. Hell is basically an Atheist's world, a world without Him. 2. People Choose to Go To Hell Let's be honest, no one in this world except Satanists want to go to Hell, even those who do not believe in Hell will admit that it is the last place that they would want to go to. So then why do I say that people choose to go to Hell? The concept of free will is often misunderstood. Free will is a gift that God gave to us when we choose to do good or bad, God has absolutely nothing to do with this. The man who murdered a family was not forced to do that, he chose to do it himself. People who go to Hell are one's that have chosen to sin without asking for forgiveness. People may not be purposely asking to go to Hell, it is how they choose to live their own lives. If they go to Hell the fault is not in God, it is in themselves and how they freely chose to live their life. 3. Anyone Can Go To Heaven Believe it or not you can have faith by not even believing in God or Jesus. This is known as faith and good works. You can show faith by doing good works throughout your life. While faith in God and Jesus is important it does not mean you are completely faithful. Faith doesn't just involve divinity, it also involves what you do in humanity throughout you life, these moral acts are know as good works. Good works can get you to heaven and purgatory. Again, faith is needed, but you can show this through doing good things, by following the 10 Commandments without even believing in them. You bring up that Christians believe that you must be Christian to go to heaven, but this is not true. You can accept Jesus without even doing it and follow his commandments by simply doing good works. A lifelong atheist that performs good works throughout his or her life can still accept Jesus at death. 4. Jesus is an Important Part of the Afterlife Old Jewish tradition stated that when the Messiah comes the gates of Heaven shall open. Because Christians believe the Messiah has already come there is now the kingdom of Heaven with Jesus at the right hand of the Father, and probably St. Peter. When Jesus resurrected He ascended into Heaven and the gates were finally open. This is why to Christians it is important to understand Jesus to understand the afterlife this is why it is important to accept Him. Note, Jews now accept the existence of Heaven without the Messiah coming yet, I am not exactly sure why. 5. We Don't Exactly Know Who Goes to Hell For all we know there could be very few people in Hell, or maybe a lot. We just don't know. God, not us, judges who goes to Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. Someone once asked my priest if the 9/11 hijackers went to Hell. He answered, ""What they did was wrong but I simply don't know because God is the ultimate judge."" Before I gave you the example of the serial killer. I did not actually say he will go to Hell, I suggested he may without truly asking for forgiveness, this was an example of free will, not of someone going to Hell. So ultimately, while we may judge people here on earth, the ultimate judge is God. Arguments for Atheists 6. Hell Creates a Good Society In many countries we follow laws so that we don't land in prison. Similar to Hell. While it is not a punishment, Hell is still a place that we do not want to be. Many people ion society do good things so that they do not go to Hell and it creates a better and safer society. I once knew someone who wanted to commit suicide because of depression but he decided not to because he was afraid of going to Hell, it can also prevent suicide. 7. Why Hell Is Not Immoral Because God is not involved in Hell there is no way that we can say that He is punishing us, plus Hell itself is not a punishment. Hell would be immoral if God purposely made someone do bad things and then unfairly send them to Hell. With free will you are not God's puppet, you ultimately decide how to live your life."	CON	89
Se4a83ec6-Ad55b831e	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"I will simply respond to the arguments Pro has made. The problem with Pro's usage of the word ""aion"" to mean a limited period of time proves too much in this instance. The Greek word used to describe Hell, aionion, in the context of the passage is used in the same context to describe Heaven. So either Pro must believe that Heaven is also around for a limited time only, or that Hell is eternal, which is more likely given the context of the passage. [1] In fact, Pro's usage of ""aion,"" the root of the word which means ""age"" (or a period with an end) to mean that of the entire Greek word does nothing short of committing the fallacy of composition. The word ""aionion"" means an eternity. As Matt Slick affirms, ""It is true that the root 'aion' means age. But just because a root means age does not mean that every word derived from that root means a limited duration of time."" [2] God Cannot Stand Sin God is, indeed, omnipresent -- everywhere that He can be. God cannot be around sin, so He doesn't reside in Hell. But He can exist anywhere in the universe He wishes, though He does not necessarily have to. God's omnipresence is not to be confused with pantheism. Just like God can't do absolutely anything (He can't sin and He can't do what is logically impossible, like creating a square triangle) yet He is still omnipotent, God can be omnipresent without existing someplace He absolutely cannot be, a place full of sin. Pro's resorting to Revelation 14 is unconvincing. God will judge sinners; that does not mean He must be around them for all eternity, or even for a short time. Hell is outer darkness, completely cut off from God. I'm sure Pro would say that even if Hell had a limited duration, it is still a place God wouldn't be (at least we can't make a case that God would ever be there). I have never said that God tolerates sin by keeping it around. After all, Pro's case says that God tolerates sin for a little while -- why not just annihilate sinners right away? Why let them suffer in Hell for even a limited time? Surely Pro should think that it is unloving for God to allow someone to suffer in Hell for any amount of time, rather than simply annihilating them. In fact, is God not ""tolerating"" sin now by allowing evil people to live on Earth rather than killing them now? Pro's case proves too much. But it seems likelier through proper Biblical hermeneutics that Hell is an eternal place for sinners. God can leave sinners in Hell for eternity without tolerating their sin -- God never has to be around it. God is Justice i) My response here is not irrelevant. I was responding to Pro's argument in the previous round. ii) I never even implied that all sins deserve the same punishment. Yes, all sins send us to Hell eventually, but there are different degrees of punishment (as I have shown). If one person has to endure a pin prick for all eternity, and another person has a large boulder dropped on him for all eternity, they are both being punished for eternity but with different degrees of punishment (not the greatest example, I'm sure, but it gets my point across). Besides which, we are not punished for just one sin, but for accumulating a multitude of sins throughout our entire lives. Free Will i) I did, apparently, misunderstand Pro's analogy. I have known many rational people who do ridiculous things despite having every reason (and every motive) not to do it (particularly thrill seekers). He could have been clearer. At any rate, when people sin they do not do so irrationally. God has placed His Law on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). When people do wrong, they know it. No one is ""without excuse"" when it comes time for judgment (Romans 1:20). So his analogy of the irrational boy fails. It would be more apt debating the ""age of accountability"" and whether an adult who is mentally challenged should be held accountable for his sins. The average (in fact, I would say most) sinner(s) are not irrational people. They know right from wrong. ii) Pro continually misses the point of free will. God must allow us to make actions which cause us pain (on Earth because it helps us to grow), and this extends to Hell. For if we were not given the choice to go to Hell, we would never have the choice to do good. We would not have free will at all, because even one sin would make us go to Hell. Therefore God would have to prevent us from sinning at all. You might as well ask why God didn't stop Adam and Eve from consuming the forbidden fruit, when He knew it would result in their spiritual death and eventual phyiscal death. The Bliss of the Saved i) As I have shown, God is eternally happy in Heaven. If God can be eternally happy, so can we. Does Pro think thing people in Heaven would be any happier knowing their friends and family were being punished in Hell, even temporarily, and then annihilated? ii) Geisler's claims don't fail. We can be happy here on Earth, despite knowing that there are others suffering in other countries (even though that suffering will likely lead us to try and help them). But if sinners refuse God's gift of salvation, then God can't be faulted if they end up in Hell for eternity. I have already shown why they have no excuse, and why God can't just eliminate their free will. It seems clear that not just through reason, but through the Scriptures that Hell is an eternal place. You just can't make a Biblical case against Hell's eternal existence, and it seems clear that justice demands that Hell is eternal.

Sc05807e6-A9ff9acdf	This House Believes that Hell exists	I agree that the Hell which you argue for does make a lot more sense and that it is more plausible. However, in this debate, we are discussing the existence of the Hell from Christian or Muslim religions. Many people believe in a Hell of eternal torment and it is that Hell which we are debating on, not the Hell of the Hindu or Buddhist interpretations. I must stress that and so, though you have given quite a bit of interesting information, it is irrelevant for this debate and therefore, the Hell which you speak of is not really a separate place from Earth but it is Earth. So it's not really relevant here but thanks for the information :) Before I continue carelessly rebutting, let me move on to the short summary of my arguments, which is the highlight of this round. My first argument is entitled Evidence, which is something most advocates of Hell would not have. They do not have the evidence to support the claim of a Hell where you are eternally tormented. As you have stipulated, any claim only remains a claim until evidence has been shown to prove that claim true. Therefore, since there is no such evidence available of a Hell which eternally torments the souls of bad people, we have no reason to believe in a Hell where one goes through eternal torment. My second argument is entitled Physical Implications. The definition of a Universe states that it is the totality of existence, including planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy (1). This would also include a Hell as well. Since we can find absolutely no traces of a separate Hell and no phenomenon which can lead us to Hell, we cannot assert the existence of Hell and therefore, we, again, have no reason to believe in one. My third argument entitled Eyewitnesses seeks to argue that one cannot really describe a place which he/she has not seen. This is where I must say that I agree with you. It is clear that the Biblical account of Hell may not be accurate. However, since we are debating on the Hell of the Bible or the Koran, we cannot include the 'Hell' of Hinduism or Buddhism, as much as I want to, though. Now, as I was saying, it is really hard to describe a place, especially when no one has seen it. I cannot really describe the situation in North Korea because I have not seen it, though I can have a vivid image of what it might be due to news which spreads quickly. Therefore, I can imagine what North Korea would look like if it was warring with other nations but I can't really be definite about it. I do hope that this summary was good enough for viewers to be able to understand my arguments quickly.. I know I can be a little bit too wordy sometimes and I must request that you forgive me if I have been that way. I must say that, though you didn't stick to the definition which was stipulated before the debate started, I learned quite a lot and I feel that that is what debate is about. I felt that I could learn something from the other side and I feel that that is enough for me. Thank you for that load of information and a good debate overall. Hope that you have a nice day.	CON	94

Se4a83ec6-A27e213b2	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"I thank KeytarHero for agreeing to debate this with me. Introduction I have already done two debates on this subject but I hope to tackle this issue yet again. [1][2] To reiterate, my position is that the existence of hell - conceived of as eternal, conscious torment (e.g. the ""traditional"" doctrine of hell) - is, in all likelihood, incompatible with the existence of a God who is conceived of as perfectly good (e.g. just, merciful, loving, etc), powerful, and wise. I think this problem presents a uniquely diffcult issue for that kind of monotheism in general and Christanity in particular; the latter position is the one I will be arguing from. Just to make clear the commitments of the traditional (eternal, conscious torment) doctrine of hell I'll use Jonathan Kvanvig's explication: The Anti-Universalism Thesis: Some persons are consigned to hell; The Existence Thesis: Hell is a place where people exist, if they are consigned there; The No Escape Thesis: There is no possibility of leaving hell and nothing one can do, change, or become in order to get out of hell once consigned there; The Retribution Thesis: The justification for hell is retributive in nature, hell being constituted to mete out punishment to those whose earthly lives and behavior warrant it. [3] One's theological or religious persuasion - whether theist or non-theist - does not matter in accepting this debate. The only type of person I hope to debate is someone who is competent and can argue powerfully for the position that the existence of hell and God, within the context of Christianity, are, in all likelihood, compatible. I accept the burden of proof inasmuch as all the opponent has to do to defeat me is show that my arguments fail to prove their conclusion. If they show my arguments do not prove their conclusion the argument points should go to my opponent. Thusly, my opponent has to show how and why my arguments fail. Good luck to KeytarHero.

Sc05807e6-A5de90768	This House Believes that Hell exists	Thank you, good sir, for accepting my debate offer. Let's have a good time, shall we? Now, before we move on, let us be clear of who the Burden of Proof is on. The people who claim that Hell exists are usually religious folks who claim that if a person does not follow the rules of their religion, they will go to hell. The idea of Hell, originally, was from religious people, as demonstrated by the definition which I gave to you on Hell and therefore, the Burden of Proof is upon you to answer all of my arguments with clear evidence so that I, as well as the people who are reading this debate, can scrutinize the evidence to check if it is Credible, Consistent and Corroborative. Let's get started, shall we? My first and main substantive for this debate would be entitled Evidence. Currently, there has been no evidence whatsoever for the existence of hell. Evidence is defined as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. There has been no such evidence whatsoever which can indicate that the belief in a Hell is true or valid. If there is some evidence on your part, please state it here with links to different websites so that I can easily cross-check the information and scrutinize the evidence. Some forms of 'evidence' can be made up, you know. Now, the normal response to this would be that the Bible is evidence that Hell is real. Well, the validity of the Bible is questionable in itself, since there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that anything in the Bible is of any historical value. If there is any evidence to prove that the events in the Bible are true, please indicate them here, again with links so that I can cross-check the evidence and information and scrutinize it. Any sort of argument, whether philosophical or scientific, has to have evidence backing it up in order to be sure of it's truth or validity. The evidence must also be good and not contradict any scientific laws unless it clearly sets out to disprove the scientific laws while replacing them with even better explanations for different phenomenon. I do not really think that there is any form of evidence which can do that, because scientific laws are being tested every single day in laboratories and have not been broken even a single time. Please provide the evidence in earnest, thank you. My second substantive will be entitled Physical Implications. Whether Hell is a place of torture or a place of love and kindness is completely irrelevant. That's a debate for another day. Ignoring all Multiple-Universe theories because of over-complications, the Universe is Nature itself and since Nature encompasses everything which existed, exists and will ever exist, Hell must also be a part of Nature and therefore, the Universe. The argument can be simplified like this: P1: The Universe encompasses everything that existed, exists and will ever exist. P2: Hell exists C: Hell is within the Universe and a part of it. However, as funny as it may sound, Scientists have been unsuccessful in detecting any sort of physical place which has lakes of eternal fires or anything of that sort. You might say that the place might be invisible to us. However, even if a certain place is invisible and unseen, as a part of the Universe, it must have some sort of effect on the Universe, just like the explosion of a star has some sort of effect on the Universe, such as releasing different materials out into the Universe. So far, we have not been able to see any of these effects on the Universe. We know this because we have traced all of the known phenomenon back to stars and galaxy. If we see two objects orbiting 'something' and suddenly disappearing, we attribute that to a black hole, because it is the only explanation which is scientifically accurate and has theoretical formulas and equations to back it up. We've traced back supernovas to exploding stars as well as black holes to stars which collapse upon their own gravitational field. Again, this is related to my first substantive, Evidence, but it is apart from it, in some sense, as it starts to delve into the implications an existing Hell would have on the Universe and how, if Hell does exist within the Universe, it does not have any effect whatsoever on the Universe as far as our highly advanced instruments of measurement can tell us. For my third and last argument, it is entitled Eyewitnesses, simply because there have not been eyewitnesses. I don't mean to make the fallacy of 'just because you can't see your brain does not mean it does not exist'. I don't mean that when I make that statement. I'm talking about the accuracy with which we describe a place which we have not really seen. It really is hard to describe what you have not seen, felt, experienced and even come into contact with. It is hard for physicists to describe the Universe because the only thing which we can rely upon are our telescopes and our satellites orbiting the Earth. Moreover, Light takes a particularly long amount of time to come from a distant star all the way to us. Therefore, we are only seeing the place as it was many, many years ago. We do not know the exact condition of the place as it is currently. So, how does one describe a place which they have not seen, felt, experienced or come into contact with? How does one simply believe in a book written by another human being who, himself, did not come into any form of contact with hell? How can someone describe Hell on the basis that it is a place for torture only because a holy book tells you that it is? The typical answer to this would be to say that 'we must have faith.'. Faith is, in this debate, defined as the strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof. It is philosophically and scientifically incorrect to just put your faith in something, especially when it has no evidence go it whatsoever. We, as human beings, have to look for the evidence for any claim which is made. If the person who made the claim does not provide any evidence for his/her claims, that claim can be dismissed as quickly as it had been made. I shall wait for your reply and I shall answer all of your substantives in Round 3. Please refrain from rebutting my arguments just yet and try to just stating your arguments as clearly as you possibly can so that I can give rebuttals towards them and you can give your rebuttals towards my arguments. Please try to type out each point under one paragraph so I can easily answer to each of your points, just as I have for your sake.

Se4a83ec6-A8e468144	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"I thank Con for his response. However, I find it to be deeply problematic. Unfortunately, I don't have the space to show some of the main problems with Con's exegesis of scripture. I will just say that none of the quoted verses Con brings forth do not do much to support the traditional understanding of hell. They are entirely compatible with annihilationist and universalist readings of the texts (both of which affirm the existence of post-mortem punishment - they just don't hold that it is eternal). I will attempt to lay out some of Con's main contentions (I don't mean to present these as simplistic strawmen, but space is limited): 1) ""God cannot stand sin, ergo hell."" This answer creates more problems than the problem it allegedly is supposed to answer. Following Eric Reitan we'll call this the ""Problem of Damned Sinners"". [1] Con has it that sin is intolerable to God. So far so good. Here's where it goes off the rails, though: as Con knows, central to Christianity is the claim that sinners can only be redeemed from their sins through God's grace. Con also has it that hell is a state wherein sinners are separated from God and His grace. So, in essence, Con has it that God basically ensures that ""intolerable"" sin will be tolerated by God forever. That's about as logically contradictory and paradoxical as one can get. As Reitan quips: ""What you’re doing is so inconceivably unacceptable that I am going to make absolutely sure that there is no way for you to ever stop doing it!"" [2]This ushers in such a deep incoherence into Con's theology that one seems to be left with no choice but to reject it as even a pseudo-answer to the problem of hell. 2) ""God is Justice, ergo hell."" i) Con contends that I begged the question with respect to God's justice not requiring him to damn some. But I really didn't. I provided some considerations such as to why God's just would require him to damn some to eternal perdition, such as the central Christian claim of the atonement wherein Jesus settled the score, so to speak, and made it so that all of us may be forgiven. If that's the case - that God's nature as justice itself was satisfied with Jesus' sacrifice on the cross - then it's clear that God would not be ""obligated"" by his nature as justice itself to damn some to torment for all eternity. ii) Con contends that I misunderstand/underestimate the heinousness of sin. I don't think that is the case but I do think it is is the case that Con has overlooked the implications of his own position. Con's doctrine of hell is based on retributivism wherein the main motivation for that theory is that the punishment fit the crime and the offender get what they deserve. Con's doctrine has it to where every sin receives the same type of punishment (torment in hell forever). Following Con's implications if I steal a pencil that sin is just as deserving of hell as serial raping and murdering young girls is. The entire point of retributivism is that punishment is proportioned to the crime, but Con's doctrine undermines that very notion. Not promising. Now we come the much propounded free will defense for hell which is probably the most common answer to the problem of hell. I will show why it's no good. 3) ""Free will, ergo hell."" There are numerous problems (and I really do mean numerous) with the free will defense but I will highlight just 2. Thomas Talbott highlights these problems beautifully. [3] i) The very notion of choosing to ""freely reject"" God is nonsense and lapses into incoherency. Talbott asks us to imagine a normal boy who, inexplicably and randomly, thrusts his hand into a fire while screaming in pain. Nonetheless, he does it even though he has strong motive not to do it and the absence of any motive to do it. Could we coherently say this boy had made a free choice to stick his hand into the fire or that he could be held morally responsible for his actions? It doesn't seem so. So, as we can see a minimal degree of rationality is required for an agent to make a free choice. But, then, we have to ask ourselves what kind of rational person would choose to be separated from God and suffer eternal torment? Remember, on Christianity, God is the source of all goodness and happiness and fundamentally wants what's in our best interests and he wants what we would want for ourselves and others if we were thinking clearly. What rational person would ""freely choose"" and actively subvert against their best interests? This raises a dilemma. Perhaps, one can allude, like Con, to C.S. Lewis when he writes about those in hell trapped in self-delusion (and/or ignorance/misunderstandings); perhaps that sort of person would ""freely choose"" to reject God. But then they wouldn't really be rejecting the real and true God, now would they? They'd be rejecting a God of their own construction and delusions - an infantile caricature of the true God. Perhaps they are like some vehement anti-theists today and believe God is morally bankrupt (see: Dawkins). One could hardly say they are ""freely choosing"" to reject God on that horn. But, on the other hand, if the person is removed of all delusions, ignorance, and misunderstandings about God they'd immediately recognize that it'd be positively absurd to ""freely choose"" to reject God. On either hand, the notion of ""freely choosing"" to reject God is simply incoherent. ii) Why if free will supposedly so sacrosanct wherein it is elevated to something so absolutely inviolable by God? Why could God not simply just override a persons' choices at least some of the time...? Remember, hell is an irreparable harm and anyone who had an adequate conception of hell would not want to go there. So the only the way they could choose to go there is only through irrationally choosing to go there (and so it wouldn't be a free choice; more like a random event). If I were to irrationally (maybe due to a mental illness) choose to jump off the empire state building without a parachute for no particular reason I would hope someone I know would stop me and my 'free will' be damned. I would not want them to sit back and say, ""Oh, well, you know, that's his choice and I'm going to respect that. Even though in a sane and rational state of mind he would never choose to do that and he has no reason to do it now, I'm going to just sit back and watch it play out."" A good friend wouldn't do that. A good God wouldn't just sit back and watch as his creatures freely choose to do irreparable harms to themselves. Why is the value of free will so elevated in the face of unrelenting torment? 4) The Bliss of the Saved i) One of Con's objections can be dismissing summarily: Con says that since God is perfectly happy in heaven while there are those suffering for all eternity, mutatis mudandis, the saved in heaven can be perfectly happy in heaven knowing that some of their former relatives, perhaps, are suffering for all eternity. But, of course, the entire debate is about whether or not such a hell exists in the first place. In fact, I'd say, contra Con, that God wouldn't be perfectly happy with some suffering for all eternity. [4] ii) Con here appeals to a quote for a Christian theologian but it doesn't seem to help. Because it seems that the saved can still regret the bad choices of loved ones (even if they deserve the consequences) and that would undermine the bliss of the saved.

S393ece2c-A4410f899	The Problem of Hell Redux	"I have mentioned human ethics cannot be applied to within this debate before round 3. ""You are attempting to apply human morality and human ethics to something which is indescribable and unknown by humanity"" (1). Instead of making these brand new arguments, and yes they are new as neither these sources nor these arguments were seen in rounds before hand, he has decided to take it upon himself to argue this point in the last round. Since I now must refute these arguments to keep my case intact it cannot be abuse as my opponent is the instigator of the new arguments. D1. The Divine Immunity Defense As my opponent aptly pointed out, if I can defend this one premise my opponents case is refuted and mine upheld. The alleged contradiction running through my debate is not a contradiction. I have stated over and over again that God does not have to follow human rationality or human ethics for the simple reason, He is not human. In other words, God's rationality is not the same as man's rationality. I can reason God has these attributes because the scripture is God's way of telling man about Himself. The only things man knows about God is contained in Christian scripture. Scripture says God IS just, in all He does. God IS good, in all He does. Passages of the infallible Christian Scripture blatantly state this. Under what authority can my opponent argue this is incorrect? Therefore, according to Christianity, anything God does is completely justified…to God, but, no necessarily to man. Gods reasoning and rationality is beyond human comprehension. Who is man to say anything God does is unjustified when the infallible word of God, given to man by God, says the exact opposite; God is justified in all He does? God would be moral if He Himself condemns man to hell (which is inaccurate) simply because God is just in every action He does. Now as for my opponent's claims about a personal God, in Christianity, God is considered to be personal for two reasons, one, God interacts with man several times throughout the Old and all throughout the New Testament. Two, God created the universe for a personal reason. He had a desire to create the Universe. A person is a human being as the evident definition of a person is defined as being a human being. God can have personal intentions, God can act personally (showing anger, etc.) But, this does not mean God is a person, God is not human, thus, all taking of application of human aspects to God are invalid. According to Christian Scripture, God is good and all He does is good. This is blatantly stated in Scripture. Since according to Christianity, everything God does is good. Creating Hell is good. So far we know, God does not send man to hell. They freely choose to go. The crux of my opponents argument is basically, how can a loving God create Hell? To answer this, I refer back to my initial argument, Hell was not meant for man and man choose to freely enter Hell by their own free will. (1) You see in order to have free will there must be both Heaven and Hell. Mankind needs to have a choice, otherwise how can they freely choose what to believe? If there is no Hell, there is no free will. There needs to be a choice in the matter. My opponent cites David Baggett and Jerry Walls to make their point. But, my opponent is citing them out of context. I will provide the entire argument they make. ""His goodness must be recognizable for our ascriptions of goodness to Him to remain meaningful, BUT there could still arise occasions where it isn't easy to see the goodness of what He commands. In fact, it would seem that some of God's commands might in a real sense involve something morally bad. We are all familiar with circumstances where the only available moral choices are in some way bad…the badness of an action does not nessesarily entail it's wrongness."" (2) My opponent cites them out of context, in reality, my opponent is claiming Hell is a bad place. But, according to Mr. Baggett and Mr. Walls, something which is ""bad"" does not make it immoral or wrong. Something which is ""bad"" can in fact, be the ""good"" choice. Hell is a good choice. Hell is not necessarily unethical or evil, as my opponent claims, its creation is good. There are two choices, create Hell to banish Satan and Satan's follower's for all eternity or allow Satan to stay in heaven potentially ruling over the earth. The question is would you prefer God to rule or Satan to rule? Personally, I prefer a good ruler rather than an evil and rationally so does everyone. Furthermore, Hell upholds the doctrine of Free-will, which is held over all other doctrines. God gave man free will. Thus, it is man's choice about their fate. This is completely ethical as God gives man the tools they need in order to make a decision about their eternal fate. God sent prophets, God even sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to save mankind. Man has everything it needs to make an informed decision. Through the infallible bible they know heaven is eternal bliss and Hell is eternal suffering. They have all the tools they need, if a person chooses to ignore these tools, then they can only blame themselves. Romans 2: 14 address the problem of how man can condemn those who never heard of Jesus Christ to Hell. To put it simply, first, God does not condemn anybody. Second, whether you go to heaven or hell is your own decision. ""if you disobey the truth that you have, even though you have never heard of Moses or of Christ, you perish, not because you didn't hear of Moses or of Christ, but because you have disobeyed truth that you already know -- that is the whole point. If you know of Moses and of Christ, and you still disobey the truth, you perish also"" (3) Thank you Pro for participating. And thank you judges for reading.

S357cd8ff-Ac92290eb	Hell is not a Bible teaching	"The Old English Word Hell My definition of hell was a necessary courtesy due to the meaning of the word having changed since it appeared, especially in older translations like the King James Version. The Old English word hell in 1611 comes from a root word which means to cover or conceal. Words from the same root word have a similar meaning. Shell, for example, is a covering. Hull is the covered part of a ship or the covering of a nut. Whole is an uncovering, heal is the covering of a wound, hill is the covering of earth or stone of the flat ground. Hall is the covered part of a building for storage or the gathering of people. To hell potatoes meant to store them underground, as in a cellar, a book heller was the worker who put the cover on a book and to hell a house meant to cover a portion of it with tile. The Hebrew Word Sheol And Greek Hades The Hebrew word sheohl (transliteration Sheol) doesn't mean pit, though it can be translated as pit, death, or grave. The Catholic Douay Version translates Sheol as hell 64 times and once as death. The King James Version translates Sheol 31 times as hell, 31 times as grave and 3 times as pit. The English Revised Version (1885) transliterated Sheol in many cases but most of the occurrences were translated as grave, or pit. Hell being used 14 times. The American Standard Version (1901) transliterated Sheol in all 65 occurrences and Hades in all ten of its occurrences. ""Sheol was located somewhere 'under' the earth . . . . The state of the dead was one of neither pain nor pleasure. Neither reward for the righteous nor punishment for the wicked was associated with Sheol. The good and bad alike, tyrants and saints, kings and orphans, Israelites and gentiles - all slept together without awareness of one another."" - Encyclopaedia Britannica (1971, Volume 11, page 276) your use of Numbers 16:33, where the ground opens up and covers the people doesn't support an eternal torment, only a covering, much like a grave. When Jonah was in the belly of the great fish he said he was in Sheol (KJV Hell, Jonah 2:1, 2) which he thought would be his grave, not a pit under the earth. The Greek word Haides (Transliteration Hades) corresponds to the Hebrew Sheol as is indicated by the apostle Peter's reference to Psalms 16:10 at Acts 2:27-31 where Jesus had fulfilled David's prophecy that Jesus would not be left in hell. Peter quoted Psalms and used the Greek Hades in place of Sheol. Gehenna The Christian Greek Gehenna is a literal place - a valley that lies South and South-West of ancient Jerusalem. It is the modern day Wadi er-Rababi (Ge Ben Hinnom), a deep, narrow valley. Today it is a peaceful and pleasant valley, unlike the surrounding dry and rocky terrain, and most certainly unlike the pagan / apostate Christian hell. In the days of unfaithful Kings Manasseh and Ahaz idolatrous worship of the pagan god Baal was conducted in the place which was then known as Geh Hinnom, (the valley of Hinnom) including human sacrifices to fire. It is ironic that the pagan custom of burning in fire, as in hell, would have so clearly infiltrated the Christian teachings, considering that this practice was a detestable thing to Jehovah God, and his prophets spoke of a time when this place would be turned into a defiled and desolate place. (2 Chronicles 28:1-3; 33:1-6 / Jeremiah 7:31-32; 32:35). The prophecy was fulfilled in the days of faithful King Josiah, who had the place, especially the area known as Topeth polluted into a refuse heap. (2 Kings 23:10) So it was that in the days of Jesus and the early Christian congregations, that the valley was known as a literal place where the carcasses of criminals and animals were thrown, having no hope for resurrection. The refuse there was kept burning with sulfur, which is abundant in the area. When Jesus used Gehenna as a figurative or symbolic reference to the spiritually dead the people in the area knew what he was talking about. Image Of Gehenna http://www.pathwaymachine.com... The link you provided seems to present the Valley of Hinnom as a place of literal punishment, but says very little of it as eternal or it's later use. The scripture they use, Jeremiah 7:31, points out that God didn't approve of the sacrifices of children to fire for Baal. If he didn't approve of it then he had nothing to do with it, especially as eternal torment. The Lake Of Fire Since death is thrown into the Lake of Fire, and death can't literally be thrown anywhere this implies the Lake of Fire is symbolic. Since the Bible itself reveals what it symbolizes it isn't necessary to speculate what it is. The second death. Also, since Hell itself is also thrown into the lake they can't both be hell. (Revelation 20:14) The Core Of The Earth Is Hell Your claim that the core of the Earth is Hell doesn't establish the Bible's supporting a hell as a literal everlasting torment. The Scripture you use to support hell as the core of Earth, Amos 9:2, only demonstrates that God is in Sheol (Hell KJV). The verse doesn't indicate a digging to the core, only to the grave as the Hebrew word, you yourself stated is a pit, or as I contend, a grave. The author of the article you linked to regarding the sound clip of tortured souls in hell himself says: ""That is why I will also not confirm to you that the story is true or not because I have not met any of these scientists."" The 'Scientists"" investigating the clip itself are paranormal investigators. Even they concluded they could be fake."	PRO	107
Sdc001e36-A21191e0	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	Introduction/rules There are usually 4 different main views of hell that the majority of Christians believe, being: A. Everlasting conscious torment B. Everlasting metaphorical mental pain from the separation of God C. Annihilationsim (soul is destroyed in hell) D. Universalism (everybody gets to heaven eventually after purgatory or hell) I will not argue against the last three, but instead I will argue that option A is unjust and immoral. If you take this debate as Con, you must believe the following: Those who do not convert to Christianity before they die will go to Hell. Those who go to Hell are in conscious pain for the rest of eternity. Those who go to Hell will never escape. I recognize that the burden of proof rests mostly upon me. Rounds: Round 1 will be acceptance and any courtesies either wishes to administer. Round 2 will Pro's opening argument and con's rebuttals Round 3 will be rebuttals and whatever new arguments either side wishes to add Round 4 will be a conclusion, each side summing up their arguments for their position. No new arguments may be given With that out of the way, I wish to say that I am looking forward to debating whoever will accept this challenge. Please do not take this debate if you disagree with the rules specified above and please do not forfeit.	PRO	108
S5474d203-Acffc1a4e	Hell does not exist	"Thank you Pro for the interesting comments. Last round, my opponent inexplicably made two outrageous claims: 1. Pro claimed that I (CON) made a positive claim that Hell does exist. 2. My opponent claimed I was the instigator! As for claim number one, I challenge my opponent to show where I ever made the positive claim that Hell exists. I didn't, and I don't have to, I am Con. All I have to do is negate Pro's claims, and I win. But dint take my word for it. Let's remember what Debate.org said about the matter: ""Unless explicitly stated, CON does not have to prove that the resolution is false, just that there is not enough evidence to prove that the resolution is true."" [1] It's easy to see who is making the positive statement. It's the person with the word ""PRO"" next to their name. CON negates (which comes from the word ""negative""). Now for the silly claim that I am the instigator of this debate. Debate.org tells you who the instigator is... the person with the word ""instigator"" next to their name at the top of the debate. My guess is that Pro realizes his/her mistake. My opponent has only participated in three debates, and may not be familiar with such things as burden of proof. So, now tat my opponent realizes that they made a mistake in crafting the resolution, he/she is trying to shift the burden of proof. Also, since Pro thought it would be a good idea to quote from the debate comments, let me return the favor. Actually, I will quote from two of the commentators: 1. ""You are claiming that a hell doesn't exist. ""If someone claimed that hell exists, they have the burden of proof. The negation of that claim is not that hell does not exist. The negation of the claim is that hell does not necessarily exist. Likewise, to say that hell does not exist is a truth claim that needs to be backed up. You've made it your job to convince us that hell does not exist. Con just needs to show that you haven't sufficiently justified that claim. The BoP is on whoever is making the claim, and right now, that is you."" 2. ""you are pro, so its up to you to back up your claim, sure usually its the guy claiming that should prove his claim, and in this case, you need to prove your claim is true, that hell dosnt exist"" Pro went on to say: ""In short, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" (-Opponent) That is true, but ""what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence"" (-C. Hitchens)"" MY RESPONSE: You are the one making the assertion that ""Hell doesn't exist"", so that's why I am able to dismiss your claim without evidence.. Christopher Hitchens never participated in a debate where the resolution was something ""doesn't exist"", so his quote isn't relevant here. WHAT WE'RE NOT DEBATING We're not debating if God exists. Pro was the first one to bring up the subject of God in this debate. I simply responded to Pro's claim that a good God wouldn't create Hell. Now Pro is asking for proof that God exists, but we're not debating if God exists. Also, for the purpose of this debate, it doesn't matter if God exists. Even if God doesn't exist, Hell could still exist. Therefore, arguing that God doesn't exist is not a valid argument that Hell doesn't exist. There, I've negated all of Pro's arguments, so the resolution is negated."	CON	109
S7e9ab92-A4f75c595	Is Hell Forever? (In Christianity)	"First and for most, yes destruction and suffering aren't the same things. However, in the Bible, they have the same concept. In hell, you do feel destruction and suffering FOREVER. (This could basically be seen as pain.) You also said, ""I think that is punishment enough..."" Please don't write what you think. Nobody really cares what you are thinking in a debate. You also said ""Some of the dead sea scrolls described roman emperors as 'eternal'... The term eternal in Greek can mean for a lifetime or an era."" Please give a source to support that claim. Also, you said, ""There punishment is ceasing to exist, forever."" Look at this statement. That statement is again, completely absurd. Why? Let me explain. First, you completely contradicted your argument of ""hell is not forever"". You have ADMITTED that punishment is forever in hell. (And what is punishment in hell? It's basically suffering and being separated from God.) Also, even if there may not be punishment in hell, at least the people who didn't believe in God are separated from God. And that was the purpose of hell in the first place. To be separated from God FOREVER. Jesus Himself said ""And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life ""(Matthew 25:46) Jesus made clear that hell is eternal and forever. Also eternal doesn't really mean ""lifetime or an era"". Think about it. According to the Bible, God literally created everything. He created the universe and even time. And the thing is, God may have said ""eternal"" in his perspective because He's the one who created everything. Continuing on, we know that God will never die because He's a perfect being. So this could literally conclude that eternal must mean forever. (However, the only way to eternal to die is if God dies. But God would never die, so basically we could see that eternal literally means forever.) This could conclude that my hell is indeed forever. Best wishes, Jason"	PRO	110
S393ece2c-A7977a42e	The Problem of Hell Redux	"Arguments: C1. Hell was never meant from mankind ""Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."" (1) Hell was clearly prepared only for the devil and the fallen angels. Man was never meant to go to hell. So the question implied is why? Why and how did man manage to be able to be banished to hell? We'll have to take a step back to answer this question. Satan, the deceiver, controls the earth. If you do not believe this, Scripture point to this conclusion. (2, 3, 4) So now comes the question of how? How did Satan come to control the Earth? Again, we look to scriptures for that answer. The angel Lucifer was proud (5). Lucifer was tasked with leading all creation in worship of God, but, as time went on Lucifer began to believe this worship should be focused on him, Lucifer, instead of God. (6, 7, 8) Lucifer decided to lead a revolt against God (9) and they ultimately failed. Why? Well, God did not make Lucifer sin but, he already had a remedy in place. (10) Ultimately, Satan and the fallen angels ended up in hell. (11) Hell was prepared for the devil, not mankind. SubC1a How did man get to hell God created man with two purposes to. First, subdue the earth and have dominion over it (to bring it back into God's control). (12) Second, to reclaim full control over the heavens, the Mystery. This purpose was kept secret from man (13) until revealed to Paul. But, the problem is, Adam sinned plunging all of man into sin (14) and into the payment for this sin…hell. (15) But, through faith and acceptance of Jesus Christ man can be saved. Man has a choice. Because man is naturally sinful without faith, they go to Hell (something NEVER meant for man to begin with). But, through faith in God and Jesus Christ man can reach Heaven. (16) Ultimately, it was Man's choice to be able to go to Hell, not God's. C2. God does not want anyone to go to hell nor does God send anyone to Hell You see, God does not send man to Hell nor does God want anybody to go to hell (17). But, in mainstream Christianity, if a person rejects Jesus Christ, they are rejecting Heaven. If they are rejecting Heaven they are freely choosing, through their own free will (18, 19), to go to Hell. There will never be a person in Heaven who does not want to be there. God died on the cross for man's sins. If a person chooses to reject this FREE gift then they cannot blame anybody but, themselves. It is man's choice whether they go to heaven (by accepting Jesus Christ) or go to hell (by denying Jesus Christ). Somebody in Hell choose to be there through their own life. They cannot blame God. R1 The Proportionality Objection People in Hell are only in Hell because they choose to be there through their own free will. Even if a sinner converts at the end of their life and accept Jesus Christ they can go to heaven. SR1 God's love God does not send anybody to Hell. It is through man's own free choice that they end up in Hell. If a person ends their life not believing in God they will go to hell. Ultimately, it is Man's choice to go to Hell. Furthermore, it is true that Christ died for man's sins and it is true God loves man but, love is a two way path. God loves all people, but, not all people love God. You have to love God back and accept God's love in order to be saved. If you do not accept God's mercy and freely choose to not love God why would God do something you do not want? You do not want to be with God, why would God send a person to be with Him for all eternity, if they obviously do not want to be with Him for eternity? That is what heaven is, being with God for eternity. God loves all man, but, not all man loves and accepts God. God does not force anybody to accept Him, Man consciously chooses whether they want to go to heaven or to hell through their life. SR2 Proportionality Here I shall provide a definition of Heaven and Hell. Heaven: being with God (love) for all eternity. Hell: the absence of God and the presence of Satan (hate, fire, death, pain) for all eternity. Heaven = happiness with God. Hell = pain with Satan (for obvious reasons). Once again, man chooses through their own free will whether to go to heaven (by accepting God) or hell (by denying God). God is not going to force a person who denies Him and does not want to be with Him, to be with Him. There is only one other choice in this scenario, Hell. Now even if you are completely correct and God does send man to Hell (which is not correct), you are attempting to apply human morality and human ethics to something which is indescribable and unknown by humanity. Man was created in Gods image and man's life is sacred from conception to natural death. So basically, if you kill someone you are killing a sacred being. For God, maybe justice is eternal punishment for killing a person. You cannot apply mans ethics and morality to something which is not man. Retribution for murder, for God, is eternity in this situation. But, still, God does not send Man to hell, they choose Hell. R2. The Bliss of the Saved Objection Pro's argument is summed up in one simple statement: how can a person truly be happy if their loved ones are suffering? In Christianity, God IS love. When a person is in Heaven, they are not love, nor is their love amplified by any means. But, when they are in Heaven a person is literally with love, God. Being sinless makes you more like God, but, it does not make you God. A person will always be happy in heaven because they are literally with love. God is pure love. (20, 21, 22, 23) Furthermore, Man will not know what sadness, pain, and anguish is when in heaven. Their memories of pain are erased and all past memories forgotten. ""For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes."" (24)Man does not remember what troubles them in heaven. Pain troubles man. Man does not know what pain is because of this they cannot ""feel bad"" for those who are in pain, even if they are loved ones. Heaven is the absence of pain, suffering, and anguish. The only memories man has in heaven is that which brings man joy. ""He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."" (25) Man remembers happiness, not pain. Back to you Pro.

Sdc001e36-Aa12883f9	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"Thank you to Daley for accepting this debate. I'm excited to have a nice and interesting debate with you, and I'm looking forward to understanding your reasoning for your position. Opening Arguments: 1. The Lottery of Religions: Pascal's Wager is a common Christian argument that states that it is better to be a Christian and for there to be no God than it is to be an atheist and for there to be a God. A visual of this argument can be seen in this link: http://disjointedthinking.jeffhughes.ca... But this is fundamentally flawed reasoning that reduces the choice of believing in the Christian God down to only two choices; belief or non-belief. The reality of the situation is much starker since there are over 10,000 different religions in the world. When confronted with the sheer number of religions to choose from, this idea starts to look less like a wager and more like a lottery. The lottery of religions can be seen in this link: http://i.imgur.com... This is only a small fraction of the 10,000 different religions in the history of the world because we couldn't possibly accommodate all of them in a single spreadsheet, and I remind you that there are even more widely differing sects within each religion. Now, there are 10,000 different ""numbers"" to choose from in the lottery with each one proclaiming that it is the truth while all other numbers are false. Some of the numbers are more popular than others, and when asked why people chose a certain number they usually say it is because they have faith in it. In fact, most of the numbers wildly assert that one will just have to believe them based upon faith. Some may offer evidence, but this evidence is obviously not sufficient to choose any one belief because we still need faith to believe in it. If any religion had sufficient and compelling evidence like their God visiting a massive amount of people to explain who is right, then we wouldn't need faith at all. But God does not provide compelling and indisputable evidence for any one religion, so we have to choose out of the 10,000 based upon blind faith. I ask you: is this really the appropriate way by which to judge people? Does the true God really decide to send people to hell simply because they chose the wrong God to worship? If this scenario is true, then literally billions of people will be sent to hell simply because they were convinced that the wrong religion was true instead of the right one. For example, if Islam is right and you get sent to be tortured for eternity because you rejected their God, would you consider their God loving or just whatsoever? No, of course you wouldn't. They could say that you chose your fate by rejecting Allah and that you deserve to be tortured for being an infidel, but you would know that it wouldn't be just to torture you at all. If you maintain the notion that people deserve to go to hell for not picking Christianity because it is right, then you must also believe that it would be justified for you to go to hell if Islam is right. I ask you to put yourself in the position of someone being sent to hell for choosing the wrong belief. So I want you to answer this question: If it is justified for God to send people to Hell for not believing in Christianity, would it also be justified for Allah to send you to Hell for not believing in him if Islam is right? It's disturbing that Christians can so easily rationalize the torture of other people for not believing, but if they were tortured because of their non-belief in Islam they would view it as completely wrong. 2. No One Consciously Chooses Hell. Hell can be proclaimed as the worst possible state of conscious existence. Many Christians try to argue that God does not send people to Hell, but rather it is the Non-Christian himself who chooses to go there. This argument can be completely falsified only by placing yourself within the shoes of the non-believer. Suppose again that Islam is right. We have both heard about Islam's claim to be the perfect word of God and rejected it, full well knowing that this could mean eternal torture. In this scenario, you have been mislead by Christianity, and I have been thoroughly mislead by science. Nonetheless, we are both going to Hell. If Islam is right, would you really say that you chose to go to Hell because you rejected Allah? All of the Christians I have ever talked to about this have said no, and I would expect that you would say the same. That's because we didn't consciously choose to be tortured, we simply weren't convinced by Islam and instead were mislead by Christianity and science. We believed in our hearts that we were right and that we would not go to Hell, and so how could that ever qualify as us choosing? This world is filled with Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and various other theists who all believe that they are right; none of them choose to go to Hell. Again, by placing yourself within the shoes of the non-believer, we can see that people don't consciously choose to go to Hell. They fully believe in their religion or their atheism, and would not be aware that their beliefs will cause them to suffer eternally. In order for someone to make a choice about anything, they must be fully conscious and aware that an action will lead to a consequence. And furthermore, if Christianity is right then God judges people based on a choice they made while the answer was obscure and greatly difficult to ascertain. Why is it that he judges me and gives me free will during life to choose heaven or hell when the answer is so hard to uncover, but when the answer becomes clear in Hell he rejects me if I want to choose to be with him in heaven? Does someone's choice of religion during life somehow outweigh their free will and choice to want to be with God when they are in Hell? For example: a man is in hell, and after 3 million years of suffering he looks up and pleads with God to let him be with God or die. Is God going to deny him this request based on a choice he made 3 million years ago during his life when the answer was unclear? If people truly choose to be in hell, then none of them would want to go out. But we can all come to a consensus that no one would want to be in Hell, and if anyone is in Hell then they are most likely begging God to let them out or let them die. Ultimately, if Hell exists then people are sent there based upon a choice they made when the answer was unclear, and they are denied their requests to die or go to heaven when they are being inhumanely tortured. How anyone can rationalize that this is justified is completely beyond me. 3. No one deserves to go to hell for eternity. When I say this, I mean absolutely no one; not Hitler, not Pol Pot , not Stalin. Now, it's important to understand that I believe Hitler should be punished for his crimes. I just don't believe he should be punished forever. If I could, I would make Hitler live through all of the millions of lives that he directly and indirectly caused suffering to. He would have to live through and die in the holocaust millions of times, watch his Jewish friends and family tortured and starving, and also have to live through and die in war millions upon millions of times. The reason why I would do this is so that he would learn a lesson about all of the suffering he caused, and so that he could build empathy and become a better person. But the point of this is clear: this punishment serves to teach him a lesson and better him as a person so that he may able to rejoin society and receive justice for his crimes. However, I would not even think about sentencing him to be tortured for all of eternity. Any finite suffering one could ever cause on Earth would be infinitesimally small compared to the suffering and torture one would endure in Hell. Everlasting torture and punishment does not better the person, teach them a lesson, nor does it reform their ways. Everlasting torture serves no other purpose but to punish the person. And since the suffering they would endure is infinitely more than suffering they could ever cause, it is only there to satisfy God and with this twisted sense of justice. There is absolutely no reason for people to be tortured forever other than to satisfy God. One could say that Hell separates evil people from the good, but God could easily do that by annihilating their existence. Plus, your fate in Hell or Heaven is not decided by how good you are. Instead it is only decided by whether you accept Jesus or not. In fact, Hell is infinitely worse than the holocaust because it literally never ends. But just like the Holocaust, Jews are sent to hell based on the fact that they are Jewish. How could you say that the holocaust is unjustified when your own God sends people to an infinitely worse place for being Jewish as well? You'll find that Jews in the holocaust and Jews in Hell have a very important thing in common: they both are being tortured simply because they are Jewish. God created Hell, God sends people to Hell because of their beliefs, God refuses to let people out of Hell once they are there, and God watches and knows everything that goes on in Hell with the complete power to end these people's pointless suffering. There is no justice with Hell, there is no lesson learned, and most importantly of all there is no one who deserves it. I simply ask Christians to have some empathy and compassion for non-believers and realize that no one could ever deserve to be tortured for eternity, especially based upon their beliefs. I await your arguments and rebuttal."	PRO	112
S44f94de9-Aae00fc4f	Medical Boards is the gates of hell	"You are correct Mr. ChevySdyme99, I am a proud tree hugger, but I must with great conviction and pride correct you on your narrow minded assessment of my persona. I am more capitalist than those fellows at Enron, I am for offshore drilling, and the only thing liberal about me is my ability to say ""No"" after a few Grey Goose Martini's……but I digress from the real issue *smiles* I too, took the liberty to research the word ""HeLL"" and again I have to say it's a case of you looking at the proverbial glass half empty. Here is what I found: The term hell is cognate to ""hole"" (cavern) and ""hollow"". It is a substantive formed from the Anglo-Saxon helan or behelian, ""to hide"". This verb has the same primitive as the Latin occulere and celare and the Greek kalyptein. Thus by derivation hell denotes a dark and hidden place…. No I ask you to look about and take in your brightly lit ""cozy"" surroundings and relish the fact that you have been chosen and what some would say ""lucky"" to work in such an esteem department.

Sedfad01e-A9e65c204	The Problem of Evil and Hell	"Thanks to Microsuck for his time and effort. I hope the readers found this debate enlightening. Fallacy of Equivocation I was not creating a straw man of Pro's argument. I am well aware he was arguing for an inconsistency in the definition of God. I was arguing that the inconsistency he was after was only valid if God is redefined to no longer have any other attributes besides agape. Pro was after this: P1. God is love P2. Love keeps no records of wrongs P3. God keeps records of wrongs P4. God cannot both be love and keep records of wrongs C. Therefore, God cannot logically exist My rebuttal directly challenged the hidden fallacy of redefinition behind the first premise. The only way for this syllogism to work is if the first premise is understood as, ""God is merely love."" I can prove this by the impossibility of the contrary. Let's use our complex definition of God and see what happens: P1. God is most loving, most good, most just, most wise, etc. P2. Love keeps no records of wrongs P3. God keeps records of wrongs P4. God cannot both be love and keep records of wrongs C. Therefore, God cannot logically exist By inserting an abbreviation of our more complex definition of God, you can now see that premise 4 fails. There is no longer a contradiction because our most loving God is also most just, and so keeping records of wrongs does not contradict his attributes. Hence, the syllogism succeeds if the fallacy of redefinition is employed and fails when the proper definition is in place. Out of Context I did indeed show that Ezekiel and Deuteronomy do not contradict original sin by showing that there are two different issues at stake here. The reason I claimed Pro was taking things out of context was because he was applying Ezekiel—which is about holding people responsible for their own sins—to original sin—which is the concept of us being unable not to sin. To put it simply, I will not be held accountable for Adam's sin any more than I will be held accountable for my daughter's sin. However, I will inevitably sin because of the consequences of Adam's sin. So I suffer because of Adam's sin, but am I being punished for his sin? Not according to Scripture, even if I feel that is the case. This is precisely what I was driving home when I said, ""Sin is not damaging to just ourselves, it affects all others around us."" A child of an alcoholic suffers not because they are being punished for the sins of the father, but because sin—by its nature—is destructive. There is no contradiction between the curse brought about by Adam's fall and the passages in Ezekiel and Deuteronomy. Pro may not like the idea of The Fall, but he has failed to show that the Bible is internally inconsistent. The Problem of Hell Pro did not provide us with an objective standard of justice, so the Problem of Hell is not sound. The Problem of Evil Pro did not provide us with real unnecessary suffering, so the Problem of Evil is unsound also. Conclusion I empathize with Pro's position, I really do. Even as a believer, I am angry at the horrific wickedness and suffering in this world. My passions, however strong, do not constitute proof of anything other than this: I have a conscience. Deep down, I know all this suffering is wrong. So does my opponent. It has to be wrong. Not by public opinion, or even my opinion. We feel in our gut that some things are just downright evil. It is that conscience that the Bible refers to when saying that in our heart of hearts, we know there is a God. For, if there is no God, then that inner sense of real evil is just an illusion. Atheists try to appease that inner voice by appealing to sociobiology and the like, but it never works in practice. If our genes were predisposed to evil, would the nonbeliever still know deep down that it is evil? Is there any excuse for the atrocities in this world, genetic or otherwise? That is what Platinga meant when he said, ""If you think there really is such a thing as horrifying wickedness (. . . and not just an illusion of some sort), then you have a powerful . . . argument [for the reality of God]."" Pro is on to something. Hell is an awful, appalling punishment. Evil is real and sickening. And only the Christian can say so with any real confidence."	CON	114

Sdc001e17-A8b4d7fa3	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"Thank you for accepting this debate, I hope that by the end of this debate we both come to understand the other's reasoning for their position. Opening Arguments: 1. The Lottery of Religions: Pascal""s Wager is a common Christian argument that states that it is better to be a Christian and for there to be no God than it is to be an atheist and for there to be a God. A visual of this argument can be seen in this link: http://www.chrisasbury.com... But this is fundamentally flawed reasoning that reduces the choice of believing in the Christian God down to only two choices; belief or non-belief. The reality of the situation is much starker since there are over 10,000 different religions in the world. When confronted with the sheer number of religions to choose from, this idea starts to look less like a wager and more like a lottery. The lottery of religions can be seen in this link: http://i.imgur.com... This is only a small fraction of the 10,000 different religions in the history of the world because we couldn't possibly accommodate all of them in a single spreadsheet, and I remind you that there are even more widely differing sects within each religion. Now, there are 10,000 different ""numbers"" to choose from in the lottery with each one proclaiming that it is the truth while all other numbers are false. Some of the numbers are more popular than others, and when asked why people chose a certain number they usually say it is because they have faith in it. In fact, most of the numbers wildly assert that one will just have to believe them based upon faith. Some may offer evidence, but this evidence is obviously not sufficient to choose any one belief because we still need faith to believe in it. If any religion had sufficient and compelling evidence like their God visiting a massive amount of people to explain who is right, then we wouldn't need faith at all. But God does not provide compelling and indisputable evidence for any one religion, so we have to choose out of the 10,000 based upon faith. I ask you: is this really the appropriate way by which to judge people? Does the true God really decide to send people to hell simply because they chose the wrong God to worship? If this scenario is true, then literally billions of people will be sent to hell simply because they were convinced that the wrong religion was true instead of the right one. For example, if Islam is right and you get sent to be tortured for eternity because you rejected their God, would you consider their God loving or just whatsoever? No, of course you wouldn't. They could say that you chose your fate by rejecting Allah and that you deserve to be tortured for being an infidel, but you would know that it wouldn't be just to torture you at all. If you maintain the notion that people deserve to go to hell for not picking Christianity because it is right, then you must also believe that it would be justified for you to go to hell if Islam is right. I ask you to put yourself in the position of someone being sent to hell for choosing the wrong belief. So I want you to answer this question: If it is justified for God to send people to Hell for not believing in Christianity, would it also be justified for Allah to send you to Hell for not believing in him if Islam is right? It's disturbing that Christians can so easily rationalize the torture of other people for not believing, but if they were tortured because of their non-belief in Islam they would view it as completely wrong. 2. No One Consciously Chooses Hell. Hell can be proclaimed as the worst possible state of conscious existence. Many Christians try to argue that God does not send people to Hell, but rather it is the Non-Christian himself who chooses to go there. This argument can be completely falsified only by placing yourself within the shoes of the non-believer. Suppose again that Islam is right. We have both heard about Islam's claim to be the perfect word of God and rejected it, full well knowing that this could mean eternal torture. In this scenario, you have been mislead by Christianity, and I have been thoroughly mislead by science. Nonetheless, we are both going to Hell. If Islam is right, would you really say that you chose to go to Hell because you rejected Allah? All of the Christians I have ever talked to about this have said no, and I would expect that you would say the same. That's because we didn't consciously choose to be tortured, we simply weren't convinced by Islam and instead were mislead by Christianity and science. We believed in our hearts that we were right and that we would not go to Hell, and so how can anyone ever choose to go to Hell? This world is filled with Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and various other theists who all believe that they are right; none of them choose to go to Hell. Again, by placing yourself within the shoes of the non-believer, we can see that people don't consciously choose to go to Hell. They fully believe in their religion or their atheism, and would not be aware that their beliefs will cause them to suffer eternally. And furthermore, if Christianity is right then God judges people based on a choice they made while the answer was obscure and greatly difficult to ascertain. Why is it that he judges me and gives me free will during life to choose heaven or hell when the answer is so hard to uncover, but when the answer becomes clear in Hell he rejects me if I want to choose to be with him in heaven? Does someone's choice of religion during life somehow outweigh their free will and choice to want to be with God when he makes himself clear when they are in hell? For example: a man is in hell, and after 3 million years of suffering he looks up and pleads with God to let him be with God or die, is God going to deny him this request based on a choice he made 3 million years ago during his life when the answer was unclear? If people truly choose to be in hell, then none of them would want to go out. But we can all come to a consensus that no one would want to be in Hell, and if anyone is in Hell then they are most likely begging God to let them out or let them die. Ultimately, if Hell exists then people are sent there based upon a choice they made when the answer was unclear, and they are denied their requests to die or go to heaven when they are being inhumanely tortured. How anyone can rationalize that this is justified is completely beyond me. 3. No one deserves to go to hell for eternity. When I say this, I mean absolutely no one; not Hitler, not Pol Pot , not Stalin. Now, it's important to understand that I believe Hitler should be punished for his crimes. I just don't believe he should be punished forever. If I could, I would make Hitler live through all of the millions of lives that he directly and indirectly caused suffering to. He would have to live through and die in the holocaust millions of times, watch his Jewish friends and family tortured and starving, and also have to live through and die in war millions upon millions of times. The reason why I would do this is so that he would learn a lesson about all of the suffering he caused, and so that he could build empathy and become a better person. But the point of this is clear: this punishment serves to teach him a lesson and better him as a person so that he may able to rejoin society and receive justice for his crimes. However, I would not even think about sentencing him to be tortured for all of eternity. Any finite suffering one could ever cause on Earth would be infinitesimally small compared to the suffering and torture one would endure in Hell. Everlasting torture and punishment does not better the person, teach them a lesson, nor does it reform their ways. Everlasting torture serves no other purpose but to punish the person, and since the suffering they would endure is infinitely more than suffering they could ever cause, it is only there to satisfy God and his vindictive sadism. There is absolutely no reason for people to be tortured forever other than to satisfy God. One could say that Hell separates evil people from the good, but God could easily do that by annihilating their existence. Plus, your fate in Hell or Heaven is not decided by how good you are. Instead it is only decided by whether you accept Jesus or not. In fact, Hell is infinitely worse than the holocaust because it literally never ends. But just like the Holocaust, Jews are sent to hell based on the fact that they are Jewish. How could you say that the holocaust is unjustified when your own God sends people to an infinitely worse place for being Jewish as well? You'll find that Jews in the holocaust and Jews in Hell have a very important thing in common: they both are being tortured simply because they are Jewish. God created Hell, God sends people to Hell because of their beliefs, God refuses to let people out of Hell once they are there, and God watches and knows everything that goes on in Hell with the complete power to end these people's pointless suffering. There is no justice with Hell, there is no lesson learned, and most importantly of all there is no one who deserves it. I simply ask you to exercise empathy and compassion for non-believers and realize that no one could ever deserve to be tortured for eternity, especially based upon their beliefs. I await your arguments and rebuttal."	PRO	116
S393ece2c-A6334bae	The Problem of Hell Redux	"Con basically has three contentions here. The Free-Will Defense There are three problems with this defense: 1) As Marilyn McCord Adams has aptly pointed out it'd be entirely irrational, unreasonable, and unethical for God to trust such limited, ignorant, and deception-prone creatures such as ourselves to make decisions regarding our eternal fate - especially since the consequences are so horrible in the case of hell! [1] We start out this life in a state of severe ignorance and helplessness and only, very gradually and very slowly, develop a picture of the world that is influenced by people just as imperfect and non-ideal as we are. This leads to us come up with with ""adaptational strategies"" (as she says) in order to cope with problems that we cannot really conceive the true consequences of or that we can truly get a handle on. Yet, these ways of thinking are carried on into adulthood either subconsciously or consciously. In any case, we start off in this life as immature, ignorant beings and the ""holdovers"" from childhood carry into adulthood which effect how we act and think. For God to create beings such as us (with all these setbacks to truly clear rational thinking) and then entrust us to make a decision about our eternal destinies in hell (which is the worse horror imaginable and even then it's scope is beyond our grasp) would be the height unreasonableness and would be immoral to boot. Imagine a parent putting their two year old in a room with perfectly safe, breathable gas but the gas will ignite if a flame is started in the room. Imagine further that there are matches with gaudy (kid-attractive) colors lying in the middle of the room. Even if the parent tells their child not to touch the stove and the child knows to obey their parent the parents are still at fault for putting their child in a situation like that in the first place. They should've known better. 2) An important distinction needs to be made here. This free will defense presumes libertarian free will as opposed to compatibalist free will. [2][3] This defense places way too much value on the ""inviolability"" of (libertarian) free will. What reason is there to believe that in the supposed ""sacrosanctity"" of libertarian free will especially when considered next to the doctrine of hell. If God could not get people to accept salvation with the libertarian free will why should he not then get by irrationally choosing that option why should you not interfere with their libertarian freely willed decision? Remember, hell is an irreparable harm and anyone who had an adequate conception of hell would not want to go there. So the only the way they could choose to go there is only through irrationally choosing to go there. If I were to irrationally (maybe due to a mental illness) choose to jump off the empire state building without a parachute for no particular reason I would hope someone I know would stop me and my 'free will' be damned. I would not want them to sit back and say, ""Oh, well, you know, that's his choice and I'm going to respect that. Even though in a sane and rational state of mind he would never choose to do that and he has no reason to do it now, I'm going to just sit back and watch it play out."" A good friend wouldn't do that. A good God wouldn't just sit back and watch as his creatures freely choose to do irreparable harms to themselves. 3) Similarly to the second point, Thomas Talbott has questioned the very coherence of the notion of a fully-informed, rational person choosing to go to hell. [4] Hell is the worst fate imaginable - in fact, it's even worse than we can imagine. If, as it is said Christian theology, God is truly the source of all that is good (love, happiness, etc) then hell would be separation from the source of all that is good. Now, if a fully-informed, rational person were to consider this hell they'd surely not choose this option for themselves. As he notes that one of the necessary conditions of being a moral agent (and being held for responsible for your actions) and/or a free will agent is a minimal degree of rationality. Obviously an infant is not a moral agent. If someone were to choose an option which they have no reason to do it and a strong reasons not to do they would be in such in a state of irrationality you'd be hard pressed to say they made a ""free choice"". In the case of hell a fully-informed, rational person would never choose hell; the only way they could do so is in a state of severe ignorance. But if they are in a state of severe ignorance my 1) shows the problems with that option. If they aren't then why would they choose hell except in a severe bout of irrationality? In that case, it wouldn't be a free choice. The Divine Mystery Defense Con here just simply contradicts himself. He claims that we can't apply human ethical claims (or by extension any human claim) to God because he is inherently indescribable and unknown. If that is the truly the case, then how is Con talking about God in his previous round as if some things can be known about him? He is deigning to describe how God works (he leaves people to freely choose hell) and also to state some truths about God. If he truly believed that God is absolutely indescribable and unknown he wouldn't accepted this debate because he wouldn't even had a concept of what God really is like. So if Con wants to say something meaningful about God he still has to deal with my objections. All he does is appeal to the 'possibility' that God might condemn people to eternal torment when that is the exact issue in question. It's begging the question. The Heart-Hardening/Memory Wipe Defense 1) When someone truly loves someone else they'd want to know about the fate of their loved ones. How many times have you heard someone say they want to know what happened to their loved one even if it pains them to know the truth? Con says God wipes the memory would actually seem to lead to a case of where God is deceiving the saved. For one, if their pain involves memories of loved ones he would essentially be erasing memories of loved ones altogether. Yet, plausibly, much of what the former life one has on earth (including, perhaps, the circumstances in which the saved even got saved) revolve around those memories of their loved ones (and considering the biblical edict that we should love our neighbors as ourselves this widens the scope of the problem considerably). In essence, heaven on Con's supposition would be like taking someone taking us to a beach resort in wherein on the other side of the high, high walls lies people anguishing in suffering, poverty and pain. The high walls are there so people at the beach resort don't have to see these folks, because, yknow, that'd ""ruin their experience"". 2) Con simply just ignores my point here. I said that an essential part of love is caring for others' well-being. If that is the case, as Christian theology surely teaches, then part of caring for others' well-being would be possessing empathy. It's all well and good to say God is love. It's another thing to say what love is as I have done (partially) and Con has not. So if the saved ""cannot feel pain"" it'd only be because there are no loved ones in pain for all eternity; not because God somehow shields their feelings of love for their loved ones. Either that or he hardens their hearts to where they start to not feel pain for the suffering of others in which that is morally problematic as well.

S63d14e3c-A10dd2e28	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	1) My opponent is arguing that the catholic church was preventing people from reading the bible. Answer: I will admit this point but I will give a number of reason to explain that. - The interdiction of reading the bible in vernacular was a temporary disciplinary measure in a specific context that was the cathar heresy it was limited in a specifipart of france. As soon as cathar heresy stopped they authorized the reading again. It was like a police measure to avoid the spreading of heresy that's all. - The 'cherry picking' of the bible lead people to interpret it on their own and if they are not guided they can be mistaken. That's why the catholic church was very careful with that because reading without a good comprehension and the lights needed can cause people to have an heretic point of view. We can see that in protestantism for instance, the lack of unity has caused different interpretation with a lot of contradictory vision of the bible, whereas the catholic church always kept his dogmas. 2) My opponent contest the fire and say it shouldn't be taken litteraly. In Matthew passage when JC affirm that it is better to cut your arm than to go in hell, he isn't of course saying to really do it but the entire point of the passage is to warn us that hell is so bad that it would still be better to be mutilated than to go in hell. It is like saying that it is better that you sell your car, than having a deadly accident with it. The image part was the mutilation to express a reality fact the hell. Why would Jesus Christ warn us about hell if it is only a grave and so it is the same thing than dying. Since every human is going to die then it would mean that the only difference between good people and bad people is that one would be ressurected and the other wouldn't. So using this logic Jesus would had only said that bad people wont go to heaven and it would be enough. Since he warned us about the danger of hell it is that obviously it is a severe punishment. There are other passages in the scriptures about hell. Matthew 8: But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth Once again if you are not conscious why JC says that they will be cry in hell ? If you are dead you are not aware of what is happening and you can't express your feelings. We also have Lazarus story in Luke. 3) Denying hell and saying it will only be annihilation is even absurd when you think about human justice. If we applied your reasoning it means like i said that the only distinction between good and evil person is that once get a reward, the other dont get the reward. It would mean that we should give a reward like money to good people for not killing someone and that we should just not give the check to a killer... Its completely unreasonable.	CON	118
Se4a83ec6-A2957f9d	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"Thanks to Con for accepting the debate. I have two general objections to the traditional doctrine of hell. The Proportionality Objection Obviously, this view of hell is heavily based upon the retributive theory of punishment in moral philosophy. [1] Hell, after all, on this view, is not for redeeming the damned nor is it for deterring other bad actions. It's for retribution; it's because they deserve to be punished. In fact, this is where the doctrine gets most of it's legs or intuitional support from. The basic idea is that God is a just (among other attributes like holy, good, loving, and the like) God and therefore has to punish sinners in hell for their unethical actions here on earth in the after life. Before even getting into proportionality objection there seems to a deep, fundamental problem - even incoherence - with saying (as many do) that a loving, merciful God 's sense of justice requires him to damn some eternally as philosophers Eric Reitan and John Kronnen have pointed out. [2] Christian theology has always maintained that every single of one us deserves hell because we all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Now, why isn't it the case that all of us will go to hell? Because it is said that God will take mercy and show grace to at least some of us and that is because Christ took on our punishments for sins and this was accomplished through the atonement. But, then, how is it supposed to be the case that God's justice requires him to damn some. Obviously it doesn't - so why would God's justice get in the way of showing mercy and love to all of his people and not sending them to a place to be eternally in torment? Obviously this would undermine the ""anti-universalism thesis"", giving us reason not to assent to that that thesis. That worry aside, the very theory of punishment the doctrine draws upon actually gives us strong reason to reject the existence of hell when placed alongside the Christian God. One can easily see how wholly disproportionate this whole scenario is. On retributivism the punishment is supposed the match the nature of the crime. If the punishment is too harsh it is unethical. Likewise, if the punishment is too lenient it is also unethical. Now, how could a finite person ever do something to warrant an infinite punishment? This seems to be a case of being far, far, far too harsh. The math does not not add up. Finite person + finite crime = infinite punishment? Even using paradigm cases of the worst that humanity has ever had to offer - say, Hitler - what he did can't ever merit an infinite, eternal punishment. Even if he gets tortured 4 quadrillion years for every person his genocidial policies affected how does that merit an infinite punishment? At some point this just punishment turns into cruelty and torture and something akin to a twisted sense of sadism. Punishing for no reason is not just. Thus, this argument seems to show that very foundation that the doctrine of hell is built upon is very shaky indeed; it even seems to refute it. So this undermines the ""retribution thesis"". The Bliss of the Saved Objection On any remotely orthodox Christian understanding of heaven it is said to be a place of unimaginable bliss and joy and happiness. This process is viewed as the pinnacle of sanctification - in other words - since our goal in this life (and maybe some more in the next) is to be Jesus-like or God-like. In heaven, people are sin-less, and thus more like God. Now, one of THE defining elements of God is love in Christianity. [3] One could easily surmise that in heaven the saved would have a God-like all abiding love for everyone as God seems to have. If that is the case, the presence of people being in a state of eternal torment seems fundamentally incompatible with the redeemed in heaven being in a state of unimaginable bliss. If we look at the concept of love we can see how just by it's very nature it is an inter-dependent thing. When one loves another that means, among other things, that one cares about what is in the others' best interests or their overall well-being. With that in mind what loving person can truly be happy while their loved ones are suffering much less suffering forever in unimaginable pain and anguish? In fact, Paul himself seems to lend credence to this argument. [4] If Paul was that anguished over just considering the fate of his people, how much more would the saved and redeemed and sanctified be anguishing over actually knowing that all of their loved ones are burning in hell? It's often noted then when two people love each other anything that happens to one automatically effects the other. If one is suffering the other suffers too because they hate to see their loved one suffering. Or vice versa. Consider the old adage, ""It makes me happy just to see you happy"". Jesus and Paul illustrate this principle well. [5][6] If that is just earthly love, it should be infinitely greater in heaven. With this in mind seems that one has to give way. The saved could not be in the ultimate state of blissfulness and happiness all the while knowing that those loved ones are suffering eternally. This presents another strong reason to reject the traditional doctrine of hell that is conceived of as eternal, conscious torment. If hell as conceived exists, then heaven as conceived does not. Or, conversely, if heaven as conceived exists, then hell as conceived does not exist. I think the latter proposition has stronger warrant. Sources [1] http://en.wikipedia.org...

S63d14e3c-A797709f2	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	"Webster""s Third New International Dictionary, unabridged, under ""Hell"" says: ""fr[om] . . . helan to conceal."" The word ""hell"" initially indicated no element of fire or suffering but simply of a ""covered over or concealed place."" In the old English dialect the expression ""helling potatoes"" meant, to place the potatoes in the ground or in a cellar.It never referred to roasting the potatoes in fire. The Encyclopedia Americana (1956, Vol. XIV, p. 81) said: ""Much confusion and misunderstanding has been caused through the early translators of the Bible persistently rendering the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades and Gehenna by the word hell. The simple transliteration of these words by the translators of the revised editions of the Bible has not sufficed to appreciably clear up this confusion and misconception."" Therefore most bible translators replaced the words ""Sheol"",""Hades"",""Gehenna"" as ""Hell"". The Hebrew word "" Sheol"" means grave. Sheol is mentioned in the hebrew scriptures of the bible. The greek words-Hades and Gehenna as found in the greek scriptures of the bible refer to the grave. In conclusion, in the original bible manuscripts the word hell was non-existent. Words such as sheol, gehenna and hades were used liberally in both the Hebrew and Greek scriptures of the holy Bible. There is no fiery place of torment. But there is the common grave of mankind."

Secondly I would like to point out that I in no way believe in either Heaven or Hell or a God in any way, however I used to be a Christian so I do indeed know many things about the bible and Christianity. It seems apparent that my opponent is attempting to take a biblical side to this debate so I shall follow suit. There are a few things that my opponent has neglected to mention about the bible. There are actually five places that exist after you die. 1)Heaven 2)Hell 3)The pit of burning sulfur 4)The New Jerusalem 5)Purgatory (which in the bible technically does not exist but there is another place similar to it in the sense that you are waiting for judgment yet you are not able to repent while there. Time does indeed Exist in the bible, in the sense of the afterlife. Currently there are people dying every single day. According to the bible these people then proceed to the purgatory type location where they will be judged according to there sins and such. Depending on there life they will then proceed to either Heaven or Hell. According to this there are people entering Heaven and Hell every single day. Therefore they are there now. Finally there is the point the is the most important, the return of Christ. Revelations outlines the events that will unfold when Christ returns to take his people home. Part of the events that unfold is when Satan is locked into the abyss for 1000 years after which he would be released for a short time.[1] However, shortly after being released he would then be thrown into the pit of burning sulfur (the pool of fire and sulfur), along with Death and Hades, and anyone who's name is not written in the book of life. Those who's names are not written are those people that went to hell. It becomes apparent that hell no longer exist. Hell is simply a the place where sinners wait until they are transferred to the true eternal place of suffering, the pit of burning sulfur. To respond to my opponents point of ""1) This place does not include time."" I must say that in a sense I have already proved this point incorrect. Not only is time apparent in Heaven and Hell but it happens to be a large importance there. Hell and Heaven only exist until God returns for his people, there after when God takes his people home there will the be seven years in which the earth goes through massive peril. After these seven years god returns again, creates the New Jerusalem and locks Satan into the abyss for 1000 years. Where after Satan returns and once again tries to take over God's reign but of course he fails. The fact that he is in there for 1000 shows that time does indeed exist. [1]http://www.usccb.org..."

S3a24f2e9-Aba1317e6	Hell does not exist.	If God was all loving, he would not send ANYONE to hell, and if he sends people to hell, he is not all loving. If God is also all knowing, he knows what sin, lust, evil, greed, etc, all these emotions feel like, and if knows what these emotions feel like, then he is also not worthy of sending anyone to hell, as the bible quotes 'Do not condemn and you will not be condemned'. If the world was created by such an intelligent and all loving God, he would also not send someone to hell just because that 'someone' was not his cheerleader. An open debate, post your arguments below and I will rebut your argument as soon as possible, thank you.	PRO	122
S3a24f2e9-A4a1b9e2a	Hell does not exist.	Thank you for answering to my first argument. Alright, fair enough, what you are saying is that we reap what we sow, and sow what we reap? What you are saying is that our Benevolent God created hell to punish sinners and non-believers, and that if we ever go to hell it is because we did not live a godly life. So, lets say, if i am a muslim, or whatever other religion that has the idea of hell itself, and i go to the hell of that specific religion which i believe in, but, oh wait! I'm a non-believer of Christ, and so i must also go to the hell of the Christian God, or his fallen angel, Satan. So, will Satan / God have to snatch me over to his side of hell or..? Besides, there are 1.6 Billion Muslims alone. Thats a lot of snatching from. Obviously, it is not free will if there are consequences after you question the existence of the one who gave you 'free will'. It's like saying to your kid, 'You can do anything you want to do, i give you the free will to do so, but if you later rob a bank, and scold me for not being a good parent, i will roast you in our micro-wave oven'. You also did not answer my first 3 points of my previous argument, which was basically my whole argument from the start. A few counter arguments you might propose to my second argument are : - Christianity is the only true religion, and if you say that then you give me the right to say that Christianity is NOT the truth, as you are basically saying that all other religions are wrong and yours isn't. - God works in mysterious ways. - Satan goes against God, and God gives him the free will, so he is able to send people to hell, as it is God's will and cannot be questioned. Satan is not God, you cannot blame God for what Satan does ( although Satan acts under the command of God ) Thank you for your time in reading this.	PRO	123
Sa350b670-A6f940c5b	never leaving hell after judgement	I would first like to state that I do not necessarily take this side outside of this debate. I am uncertain, but I don't out-right consider it wrong. But for this debate I am taking the con side full on. If my opponent is good mabey I will have a definitive oppion afterwards. taking the Pro side means defending the tipical christian view, as if you are wishing to argue with an athiest perspective that there is no hell to start with, that would not contradict the my side but embrace it an new extream. when I say 'leaving hell' I am not asking you defend the position from experinces like Mr Wieses (see video) http://www.youtube.com... , This is why I included the term 'Judgement' in the top so that I could not argue with someone elses possible experinces that clearly are only for the purpose of making someone belive or motivate to reach out to those who dont. after judgement means not going to hell breifly as a warning but rather after the warnings are up. In essence my position is that of Universleism, sorta. But I dont have to argue that all get out, only that all could, which allows room for the possibility that some never do because they hold themselves there. The primary argument against universleism is that in the bible it uses the greek word 'anios' wich can only be translated as eternal or everlasting. That this leaves no room for filling in the blanks ourselves on time duration. but Traditional teachings about Hell and Heaven is that time is irrelevant there, for eternity is outside of time, it occurse as if at the same instante as every instant in the past, present, and future. So if one were to go to ethier of these two places, Heven or Hell, and then leave to somewhere else, How long would you have to state you there? The only descriptive term avalible is 'for eternity' because it is in eternity. If you left Heven or Hell and returned here on Earth, and someone gave binoculers to see into Heven or Hell at the present moment, I propose you would infact still see yourself there (witchever you were in, Heven or Hell), because there there is no time there. If are there ever, you are there always, even if you leave. plus this would provide room for theology that explains true purpose for hell's fire. If they can not be reconsiled, why not have anihalationism be true? after all they no longer can be prepared for any function stuck in hell forever to never leave, no legistical value is accomplished from there continued existance. I am not judgeing god on a permenant stay being cruel or just, only noting a lack of constructive purpose. But fire is often used as poetry for our trails that make us grow. the exersise of endurance that makes us stronger individuals. and best of all, its association with the purefication of metals. the kind of character that is associated with being sentanced to hell, if we were to ask 'what would it take to make them good'. Well Hell's fire may be the only way. Now an mabey an individual could have solidified there anger against god in this life that there will against God might fundamentaly hold themselves in Hell, despite the fires. But there are no more extream means conceavible to implement after this so they do end up stuck there forever. So to recap: 1) This place does not include time. 2) without times relevance, if you are there ever, you are there always, regardless of your departure. 3) annialationism makes legistical sense in dealing with an unreconcileble soul. 4) 'Fire' methephoric or not, could potentialy be used as a reconcilling tool for the worst case scenario's. 5) even granted 4, it may not be inevitable that it will break a soul to Gods will, even if its the only way possible. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://flyinabove.bloghi.com... http://www.poemhunter.com...

Sdc001e17-A2f9387f5	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	Introduction/rules There are usually 4 different main views of hell that the majority of Christians believe, being: A. Everlasting conscious torment B. Everlasting metaphorical mental pain from the separation of God C. Annihilationsim (soul is destroyed in hell) D. Universalism (everybody gets to heaven eventually after purgatory or hell) I am not here to refute the last three, but instead I will be arguing against A) which is the traditional dominating view of hell that asserts that souls who do not accept Jesus Christ will go to hell where they are given everlasting conscious torment. I will be arguing that this is unjust and immoral. Rounds: Round 1 will be acceptance and any courtesies either wishes to administer. Round 2 will be opening arguments Round 3 will be rebuttals and whatever new arguments either side wishes to add Round 4 will be a conclusion, each side summing up their arguments for their position.

S357cd8ff-Af896817	Hell is not a Bible teaching	"I was very clear that the travelers to the core and what they reported to have heard was discarded due to speculation of falsehood by people who didn't even care to meet them. There is no evidence that suggests the meeting failing to exist between the scientiests and the signapore scientiests was the fault of the travelers and not the fault of the speculators easy dismissal of the findings. Again, this point wasn't the ENTIRE point, just a supporting idea. You use Jonah comparing being in the belly of a fish as SHEOL, which is funny that you would use that verse to automatically claim a general standard of symbolism for the entire hell references. This is funny because some would say Jonah being stuck in the belly of the fish was actually the symbolic portion of the text and not the reference made to Hell. It is great that you were able to look up the origins of words, but none of your origin based philosophy disproves the lake of fire's existence. It's simply word play. However, if you want further points to be made for the existence of the lake of fire, here: You say verses like ""death was cast into the lake of fire"" is symbolic due to deaths immaterial nature, I would say that your logic is simplistic at best. Jesus said I give you life. In order to receive life we must take it. But how then could we ""take"" life using your logic, this too is a symbolic verse. What is it symbolic for? I guess life would mean eternal existence, happiness joy, the pleasure of heaven, and what ever else he has instore for us, but we will still be ALIVE, which is the material nature of the word life, just not being dead. Therefore, ""Death being cast into hell"" means that anyone who chose not to come to Jesus and accept the gift of life, because notice that is exactly what life is, a gift that can only come from Jesus (remember, we are arguing about what the BIBLE says and not our own belief systems or opinions on the text itself. It states clear as day Jesus gives life, and no one can go to the father except through him, and any who is not for Jesus is against Jesus) Therefore, if we CHOOSE LIFE and GO WHERE IT GOES.... Why then would those who do not choose Jesus/life not GO WHERE DEATH GOES? This is the biblical explanation that can be found by any coherent reader of the text. Those who choose life FOLLOW LIFE INTO HEAVEN and those who CHOOSE DEATH FOLLOW DEATH INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE.... OKAY So it is abundandly clear that those who do not choose life but choose death do not go where life goes... it seems the problem here is you believing that Hell is a literal place. It seems perhaps you think that we just sleep forever or remain in our caasket with our dead corpse? I find it hard to argue with someone who hasn't given their idea of hell or rather or not they even believe in one. I think saying you DON'T believe in one, however, would be contradictory to your arguments that you've made against the ""lake of fire"" but not hell itsself. Another example: ""you said DEATH CAN NOT BE ""THROWN"" ANYWHERE (because of it's immaterial nature), and so this means the verse saying death is thrown in hell is symbolic and therefore hell is not a real place in the verse. Look at this verse: John 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. In this verse it states clearly that we ""pass from death unto life""... This would insinuate that we are "" in death"".... if we connect our ""symbolic dots"" we will see that death is thrown into hell, and we are all IN DEATH until we hear and believe and pass out of death and into life by believing in God/Jesus. Therefore, if Death is cast into hell, and we are ""IN DEATH"" then we would be ""IN HELL"" unless we were ""IN JESUS"".... I'll leave you with a few verses: Mat 18:8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire Job 18 describes, "" the place of him that knoweth not God"" (vs 21), as, ""brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."" (vs 15) Psalm 11:5 says of the wicked, ""fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup."" The wrath of God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with ""brimstone and fire."" (Genesis 19:24) The demonic locusts from the bottomless pit of Revelation 9:17 issued ""out of their mouths fire and smoke and brimstone. revelation 21:8, again describes eternal damnation as ""the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."" HOWEVER, You do appear to be right that Hell was not directly mentioned in the original bible... but it is directly mentioned in all the new editions. Remember this verse then, as I shift a little hear: ""God has given us the power of life and death, and that power is in the tongue"" "" Proverbs 18:21 - Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof"" James 3:5 Verse Concepts So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! - See more at: http://bible.knowing-jesus.com...

Se4a83ea7-A7fc98175	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"Thanks to Con for accepting the debate. I have two general objections to the traditional doctrine of hell. The Proportionality Objection Obviously, this view of hell is heavily based upon the retributive theory of punishment in moral philosophy. [1] Hell, after all, on this view, is not for redeeming the damned nor is it for deterring other bad actions. It's for retribution; it's because they deserve to be punished. In fact, this is where the doctrine gets most of it's legs or intuitional support from. The basic idea is that God is a just (among other attributes like holy, good, loving, and the like) God and therefore has to punish sinners in hell for their unethical actions here on earth in the after life. Before even getting into proportionality objection there seems to a deep, fundamental problem - even incoherence - with saying (as many do) that a loving, merciful God 's sense of justice requires him to damn some eternally as philosophers Eric Reitan and John Kronnen have pointed out. [2] Christian theology has always maintained that every single of one us deserves hell because we all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Now, why isn't it the case that all of us will go to hell? Because it is said that God will take mercy and show grace to at least some of us and that is because Christ took on our punishments for sins and this was accomplished through the atonement. But, then, how is it supposed to be the case that God's justice requires him to damn some. Obviously it doesn't - so why would God's justice get in the way of showing mercy and love to all of his people and not sending them to a place to be eternally in torment? Obviously this would undermine the ""anti-universalism thesis"", giving us reason not to assent to that that thesis. That worry aside, the very theory of punishment the doctrine draws upon actually gives us strong reason to reject the existence of hell when placed alongside the Christian God. One can easily see how wholly disproportionate this whole scenario is. On retributivism the punishment is supposed the match the nature of the crime. If the punishment is too harsh it is unethical. Likewise, if the punishment is too lenient it is also unethical. Now, how could a finite person ever do something to warrant an infinite punishment? This seems to be a case of being far, far, far too harsh. The math does not not add up. Finite person + finite crime = infinite punishment? Even using paradigm cases of the worst that humanity has ever had to offer - say, Hitler - what he did can't ever merit an infinite, eternal punishment. Even if he gets tortured 4 quadrillion years for every person his genocidial policies affected how does that merit an infinite punishment? At some point this just punishment turns into cruelty and torture and something akin to a twisted sense of sadism. Punishing for no reason is not just. Thus, this argument seems to show that very foundation that the doctrine of hell is built upon is very shaky indeed; it even seems to refute it. So this undermines the ""retribution thesis"". The Bliss of the Saved Objection On any remotely orthodox Christian understanding of heaven it is said to be a place of unimaginable bliss and joy and happiness. This process is viewed as the pinnacle of sanctification - in other words - since our goal in this life (and maybe some more in the next) is to be Jesus-like or God-like. In heaven, people are sin-less, and thus more like God. Now, one of THE defining elements of God is love in Christianity. [3] One could easily surmise that in heaven the saved would have a God-like all abiding love for everyone as God seems to have. If that is the case, the presence of people being in a state of eternal torment seems fundamentally incompatible with the redeemed in heaven being in a state of unimaginable bliss. If we look at the concept of love we can see how just by it's very nature it is an inter-dependent thing. When one loves another that means, among other things, that one cares about what is in the others' best interests or their overall well-being. With that in mind what loving person can truly be happy while their loved ones are suffering much less suffering forever in unimaginable pain and anguish? In fact, Paul himself seems to lend credence to this argument. [4] If Paul was that anguished over just considering the fate of his people, how much more would the saved and redeemed and sanctified be anguishing over actually knowing that all of their loved ones are burning in hell? It's often noted then when two people love each other anything that happens to one automatically effects the other. If one is suffering the other suffers too because they hate to see their loved one suffering. Or vice versa. Consider the old adage, ""It makes me happy just to see you happy"". Jesus and Paul illustrate this principle well. [5][6] If that is just earthly love, it should be infinitely greater in heaven. With this in mind seems that one has to give way. The saved could not be in the ultimate state of blissfulness and happiness all the while knowing that those loved ones are suffering eternally. This presents another strong reason to reject the traditional doctrine of hell that is conceived of as eternal, conscious torment. If hell as conceived exists, then heaven as conceived does not. Or, conversely, if heaven as conceived exists, then hell as conceived does not exist. I think the latter proposition has stronger warrant. Sources [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://www.public.asu.edu... [3] 1 John 4:8: "" Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."" [4] Rom 9:2-3: ""I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people."" [5] Matt 25: 40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ .... 45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ [6] Phil 2:27: ""He was indeed so ill that he nearly died.

Sc05807e6-Ada350448	This House Believes that Hell exists	Ah yes. I agree that the explanation on the part of Hinduism is very intriguing and though it is not new to me, it still remains as a hell (no pun intended) of a lot better explanation for where Hell is, which is on Earth itself. It truly is a much better explanation, though I do not agree with the part about God as stated in your link. But onto my rebuttals. I shall keep them plain and simple. Though interesting, the 'Hell' of Hinduism is not the debate which we are having right now. The definition states that Hell, in the context of this debate, is the place where the souls of bad people are believed to be punished after death, especially in the Christian and Muslim religions. In other words, eternal damnation. You know, burning in lakes of fires and that sort of thing. I urge you to stick to the definition of the debate itself, since the definition states that the souls of bad people are punished after death. You must first prove the existence of a soul, which you can't cos there are not enough rounds in the debate (I'm sorry), and then you must prove that Hell itself is a place which exists and it is separate from Earth, as stated by Christian and Muslim religions. As I have mentioned before, your reference to the Hindu religion is intriguing and it is of great intellectual value. However, it isn't really relevant to the debate as stipulated by the definition of Hell. Reincarnation, in the sense you have just stated, is much more interesting than me being reincarnated literally into a Dog in my next life or a Cow or a Pig. It has been scientifically proven that even if you are dead, the atoms which make up your body still exist and will be converted from one form to another, thus ensuring that you continue to 'live' on in different forms, thus proving Reincarnation. However, Reincarnation, in that sense, is really metaphorical and not literal in the sense of 'I'm a human now and in my next life, my soul will be transformed into a Dog because I did something wrong in this life.'. We don't exactly know how the atoms of our body are going to change from one form to another, after we die and our bodies decompose. So, our 'Reincarnation' does not really depend upon any of the deeds which we did in this life. It's a natural process and since it is clear that natural processes don't actually care what happens to us, our deeds make no difference whatever in our 'reincarnation'. However intriguing this topic is, though, it is not related to the Hell as stated in the definition for this debate. Under normal circumstances, your explanation would suffice in a metaphorical sense of 'Hell' but then, in this debate, we're talking about whether the literal sense of 'Hell' even exists. The definition for this debate also does state that Hell is a place where the souls of bad people are punished. If we argue on the basis of the Hindu Hell, which is basically on Earth itself, are we all, therefore souls? But that's a fallacy, considering that souls are immaterial and therefore, they are not subject to the Laws of Physics. But we are clearly subject to the Laws of Physics, which clearly proves that we are material and physical, which also proves that we cannot be souls. With all due respect, I also hope or, dare I say, pray that you do not mean it when you say that African women who have their genitals mutilated deserve that kind of treatment. I believe that it is a little bit sadistic, if you don't mind me saying. Again, we are debating on the Hell which is stated by Muslim and Christian religions and any other religion which shares their beliefs about Hell and the concept of eternal damnation. Please follow the definition in your rebuttal of my arguments in this round. Thank you and please note that in your reply, you must refute the arguments which I posted against the motion itself. There should be no direct rebuttals to my rebuttals against your arguments. Rebuttals against my arguments should be the key content in your replies.

S63d14e3c-Afeea3005	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	1) Pro states that the passage about hell shouldn't be interpretated litteraly, pro argues that Jesus was talking parabols in some occasion. A parabole is a story with some fictional characters thus the passage of the bible that i cited (Matthew 8 and Mark 9 aren't paraboles), only the Lazarus story is one. Lets analyze again my passages: Mark 9 : to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. Matthew 8: But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth Pro thinks that these passage are only images or metaphors. But even with a metaphoric kind of interpretation it still conveys the idea that the place depicted as hell is a horrible place with some kind of conscious suffering. Pro still didn't explain how a 'sheol', 'grave', 'annhilitation' or other meet these 2 criterias as it is: a punitive place, conscious suffering. 2) It is unclear of pro position about people that die in their sin I dont understand if he thinks that they will be annihilated or ressurected. Pro needs to be clear and answer what will happen in his views for people that are damned. 3) Pro then tries to explain that hell would be impossible by saying that god mercy wouldn't permit that, he then states that god condemns child burning sacrifice and so god would be an 'hypocrite' the debate wasn't about legitimacy but reality of hell so i wont extend myself on this subject. -Pro argument doesn't take into consideration that god has several infinite attributes: love, mercy of course but also justice. When Jesus saved Mary Magdalene he could condemn her for her sin with his justice it would be legitimate but he decided to give her mercy. -There is no hypocrisy of god there he has all the rights to condemn people for bad actions. When god was condemning people from burning their children they were not doing it as a punishment in order to give justice they were doing a sacrifice to false god, they werent judges and childrens are innocent.

I then mentioned Hiland Lake, (which is definitely google worthy for a laugh or two). My next argument was, of course, Hinduism. The only valid evidence of there being a Hell would be karma and the act of a type of reincarnation. And while I did not exactly enjoy having to lean on philosophy, karma would be what would determine the fate of souls and such, and why ""bad"" things happen in life (because it is ""well deserved"" and Hell is merely the Earth). My last and final argument, was reincarnation, but not the sort where one would be a human one life then a dog the next. More so appealing to the science side of things, with life, death, decay, then life once more. This would be the cycle of all living things, keeping us in an eternal Hell (Earth).

Sdc001e36-A8d8571e2	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"Pro believes that ""The purpose of punishment is usually to reform the criminal""s behavior so that they will not commit the crime again."" This is not true. That""s the purpose of a rehab program, not the punishment. When a judge sentences a person death, how does this punishment reform the person? When a person receives life in prison, what use is reformation to him when he will never re-enter society? Locking up a person by itself doesn""t reform anybody, unless a program of teaching is put in place to help the person see a better way of living. Pro is confusing discipline with punishment. Punishment is there simply to give the sinner what they deserve for what they have done, to satisfy the requirements of justice. So hell""s inability to reform doesn""t make it unjust. Pro argues that hell has no room for empathy or compassion, so does a lifetime prison sentence have any room for these qualities? What shows Pro is wrong, is the fact that there are different degrees of punishment in hell. (Luke 10:12-14) Some will experience a part of hell known as ""the outer darkness."" (Matthew 8:12) I have argued that there will actually be more relief from the fires of hell for some than for others, how is that not compassion? But Pro""s problem with hell is that it lasts forever. But I never said that people who go to hell couldn""t be freed from this place if they didn""t repent. They are the ones who choose to hate God and continue to reject him. Maybe Pro imagines that in hell, they are chained to wall, unable to move, but that""s not necessarily the case. They may very well be able to move around to continue their evil deeds. Lucifer in Isaiah 14 was met by others in hell who came to meet him and speak to him, so who knows what other sins they continue to commit in hell. Pro is just ignorant of Christian doctrine concerning hell. I never argued that the purpose of hell is to eliminate sin; that was Pro""s idea. Pro argued that many people can""t find God because of the lottery of religions, to which I replied that if God exists, he would know who would accept him and would be able to reach them with sufficient evidence "" it""s only logical. Furthermore, I said there are exceptions to every rule. God can judge the unreached on the basis of what they did with the little truth they knew based on conscience or even nature. (Rom 1:20; 2:7, 14-15) To this Pro claimed that by preaching Christianity God then seals the fate of people who reject that message to hellfire. He prefers God keep all in ignorance by not preaching about himself so he can save more of them. But if a loving God exists who wants a relationship with us it""s only logical that he will try to educate us about himself and his ways, and won""t leave us to ourselves. What kind of father hides himself from his children? Pro is the one who wants God to show himself. If God exists, living by his ways would be the most beneficial way of living. To deprive us of that knowledge on behalf of those whose hearts would have rejected it is absurd in the extreme, and to bring people who don""t love God or his ways into heaven contradicts the very definition of God as being a morally perfect being. So while Pro argues that a morally perfect God would not send people to hell, he believes that a morally perfect God would fill his presence with sin by rewarding evil people with heaven. If wicked people are going to heaven, why bother to live holy lives? It all ends up the same, so lets rape, steal and kill. My rational for hell being eternal involves the eternality of God""s qualities. It seems to me that for any being to be God, he cannot be limited. He must be eternal in his attributes, for example eternal in power, no end to his wisdom, no end to his love, etc. But if the depth of God""s love for what is good is eternal, so that he rewards the righteous with eternal bliss in heaven, it seems logical and necessary that his hatred of evil, of sin, must also be eternal, and must be reflected in whatever punishment he inflicts on the guilty. So eternal retribution would be in harmony with divine justice, but since we are finite beings we may not comprehend just how much God hates, anymore than we comprehend just how deep he loves. When God hurts, he hurts infinitely more than we do. So sins against God deserve infinite punishment. Add to this the fact that they continue to sin in hell, and I can see why God would punish them forever. Now Pro claims that at least one person would become a real Christian if God revealed himself and that would be worth it. Pro seems to be an expert on what""s in people""s hearts, so let me do an experiment with his. So, you are an atheist, and let""s say you think there is nothing wrong with fornication, homosexuality, and you believe in evolution; but given enough evidence you would believe in God""s existence. God appears to you and then you believe he exists, then what? Do you suddenly abhor fornication, homosexuality and evolution? No. You""re heart condition and beliefs have not change! So you ask God to give you reasons why he says these things are wrong. He says sex is primarily for reproduction to create a new family, and I desire families to be made only in the context of marriage. Homosexuality is unnatural, that""s not what I made you for, and I created mankind, they didn""t evolve. In reply, you say to God, but when I have sex outside of marriage with a consenting adult, and I use protection, I""m not hurting anyone; and I could say the same thing about homosexuals, and I actually have good evidence for evolution, so why should I take your word against all the science I know? All the world""s scientists can""t be wrong, could they? ""They are,"" God said, and you rejected him. Either because you think he is a liar, or, more likely, you simply don""t agree with him. You see, you must understand they are millions of people who will never prefer God""s ways over their own. Just believing in God""s existence won""t make anyone a Christian, nor will it stop people from putting other things at the centre of their lives, which amounts to worshipping other gods anyway "" gods of sex, money, and fame. If God himself came down on a cloud and told you to accept his authority to make the rules, and even told you that as your Creator he doesn""t owe you an explanation, you are the one who owes him an explanation for why you didn""t live up to his requirements, would you humble yourself to him? Honestly, I personally believe that if God appears in US Air Space unannounced the government would send fighter jets to shoot him down. Further, Pro keeps talking about an ""unintentional mistake,"" but a mistake is something accidental, it""s not a well informed choice. Most people who reject God have been informed about him and choose not to believe. Pro says that God must ""use logic and empathy to arrive at the right moral conclusion,"" but I don""t believe God uses the same KIND OF LOGIC Pro uses, because just like I use logic which disagrees with Pro, God can use logic which also disagrees with Pro. I have shown examples of how logic has been used to justify behavior Pro calls immoral, so logic does not produce empathy. The logic used in court in favor of keeping the blacks in slavery in America was that the money they would need to compensate the slave owners would break the treasury. Here was a logical argument, was it empathetic? Further again, God doesn""t decide morality based on logic, but on his own character. Whatever his character is, that sets the standard for morality. So if God was evil, we would have a different set of morals from if he was loving. So my argument is that to know the kind of morals God would imbue in this world, would require knowing what kind of God he is to begin with. If there was no God, we would not have evolved morality, period. How do I know? Because there is no morality in the animal kingdom. When a lion eats a zebra, he does not murder her, he eats her. When a male white shark forcibly copulates with a female shark, it isn""t rape, its just doing what comes naturally to him. So I have no reason to think that animals would evolve a sense of faithfulness in marriage, when multiple partners takes presence during mating season for most species. I wouldn""t expect anyone to care about cruelty to animals, because in the animal kingdom no species cares about the wellbeing of a different species. If, as atheistic scientists claim homosexuality is natural among animals, there would be no natural reason for this taboo against gay acts to arise. Justice and morality cannot be decided by logic, because many logical reasons have been given against the death penalty, such as the fact that sometimes innocent people are convicted, and when their case is reviewed and they are found innocent, they can't benefit if they are dead. However, logical reasons have been for the death penalty, such as taking away the victims right to live demands an equal punishment on the killer, which is death - only one life for another can balance the scales of justice. The punishment fits the crime. Both claims are logical, but only one decision can be morality, and just! One could aim to reduce suffering by rejecting the death penalty so the criminal doesn't suffer the pain of death, but others could argue that being locked away with other criminals is lots of pain too. Horrible things happen to people in prison. Some would prefer death than go to jail. So logic, reducing suffering, all of it is no way to make moral decisions. Something which transcends human opinion is the source of morality, God's character. I close my case."	CON	134
Sb471a2b7-A7eff9998	It is ethical for God to send people to Hell.	"-DEFINITIONS- God: The Christian God... omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, omni-benevolent. Hell: the abode of Satan and the forces of evil; where sinners suffer eternal punishment (Princeton Wordnet) ethical: ethical motive: motivation based on ideas of right and wrong (Princeton Wordnet) -BURDEN- Pro must show that it is completely ethical or mostly ethical for God to condemn people to Hell. Pro can do this by showing why my points are irrelevant, unethical, fallacious, etc. In doing this, pro must avoid those attributes himself. Pro is NOT welcome to play with semantics. Oppositely, Con must show that is completely unethical or mostly unethical for God to condemn people to Hell. Con is bound by the same guidelines as Pro (see above). To begin, I believe it is UNETHICAL for God to send people to Hell. Onto my case... -NEGATIVE CASE- A: Criteria for acceptance into Heaven, estimations, and sin Sin = vialation of a law of God (e.g. 10 Commandments) A1. In order to go to Heaven from a Christian perspective, one must faithfully believe in God and that Jesus died for his/her sins, admit to being a sinner, and ask for forgiveness [1]. Doing more good deeds than bad deeds is simply not enough and will actually land you in Hell. A2. ""Now, let's say that one in ten people are genuine born-again Believers. We are clearly told in Matthew 7:14 that few people ever make it to heaven!, 'Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT' (Matthew 7:14; Luke 13:23,24). Consider the billion people in China who know not the Lord Jesus Christ! Consider the countless hundreds of millions of Arabs (Islamic Muslims) who worship Allah and the prophet Mohammed. Consider the billion Catholics around the world that worship Mary and are trying to earn their way into Heaven through the keeping of the Seven-Sacraments and good works. Countless billions of people are trusting in their religion to save them instead of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have no doubts whatsoever that 90% of the people in this world are going to Hell. Why? For one simple reason friend, they do not have the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior, their sins have not been forgiven. We estimated that 232,876 humans die every day on average. 232,876 minus 10% equals 209,588 people that perish into hell fire and destruction every single day that passes. So roughly, 200,000 HUMANS PLUNGE INTO HELL FIRE EACH AND EVERY DAY! We also see that 23,287 people (10%) make it to Heaven each day on average."" [2] So, on an average day, 10% of people are going to Heaven and the other 90% are headed to Hell. A3. Sinning is in our nature and is an innate process [3]. The ONLY way around sin is explained in A1. God hates sin [4]. A-Arguments: As established in my A section, God absolutely hates sin. However, we are sinners by nature, it's not something we can control. Since God is omniscient, he knew that Adam and Eve would begin this innate, sinful nature for all of mankind to be doomed to. This is questionable on its own but to further my argument, I'll let it slide for the moment. Now, sin is just a factor in going to Hell, it's not the main reason. If it was, absolutely no one could get into Heaven. The main reason for going to Hell appears to be NOT asking for forgiveness and not correctly conforming to Christ. Pro may wonder why this is so challenging but when we examine the diversity of religion, you will see condeming people to Hell is unethical. I would argue that even condeming serial killers or child molesters wouldn't be just. Hell is eternal punishment and I doubt it is possible to even fathom such a thing. I'm sure Pro knows of the victims in the Holocaust and how they were savagely treated - can you imagine the Hellish torture they are currectly receiving and will be receiving forever? After all, Jewish people don't go to Heaven because they technically reject Christ [5]. This ISN'T ethical. B: Ethics of sending people to Hell, religious observations, and tolerance B1. There are a practically endless list of religions and they are true to each of their respective followers. Religion is a significant component of many cultures. B2. Eternal suffering is the worst punishment one could receive. You can be tortured, raped, beat up, etc. but those do not last forever. It would be nearly impossible to even imagine eternal suffering. B3. In some cultures, finding Christianity wouldn't be possible nor acceptable. B4. God essentially sends you to Hell for not being accountable to him and devoted to Jesus Christ. He will also send you to Hell if you have different beliefs. To draw this to scale and apply it to real life, it would be as if I wouldn't be friends with someone because they held different beliefs than me. This is unacceptable, especially of a being that is supposedly all-good. B-Arguments: I stated in my A-Arguments section that condeming people to enternal punishment no matter how severe their transgressions were is unethical. Sending people to Hell just because they do not believe in you and do not worship you is barbaric. On a similar note, sending people to Hell because they worship a different God than you is also barbaric and an extremely jealous act. God loves all his creations yet according to my A2, most people are going to Hell anyhow. God is omniscient, he knows this is going to happen and apparently he is perfectly fine with it because he won't do anything about it. Surely, if you loved someone, you wouldn't let them suffer; especially not for eternity. No matter how far a human sins, he/she is still one of God's creations. -NEGATIVE CONCLUSION- It is definitely unethical to send people to Hell for the reasons I have provided. I await Pro's response.

""( Roman Catholic Douay Rheims 1899 edition) This clearly mentions hell as being a place where there is no work, reason, wisdom nor knowledge. It""s a place of inactivity-a grave. Acts2:31,32(Roman Catholic Douay Rheims 1899 edition)-""He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses."" The Apostle stated that Jesus went to hell and God resurrected him. If hell is a place of torment for the wicked, why did a righteous man like Jesus go there? Psalms16:10-(King James Version)""For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."" The bible writer was confident that when he dies and goes to hell (grave). God wont forsake him. Genesis 44:26-29-""(Roman Catholic Douay Rheims 1899 edition)-""And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.

Righteous Job said God would hide him in a grave(hell) and God will call him out of the grave(hell). There are several scriptures that underscore the indisputable fact that the wicked will be punish if they don""t repent. Psalms37:9,10-""For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be"". Isaiah 55:7-""Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."" Isaiah48:22-""There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.""

Malachi4:3-"" And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts."" Hell fire is deeply rooted in paganism. Constantine was the Roman emperor who convened the Council of Nicaea( the first ecumenical council of the Christian church, meeting in ancient Nicaea . Emperor Constantine I, an unbaptized catechumen, who presided and dominated over the session in 325""C.E.) Emperor Constantine influenced the church to adopt unscriptural doctrines such as hell fire. He did this to solidify his empire of pagans and Christians for political reasons. Encyclopedia Britannica adds: ""Under Christianity, Greek heroes and even deities survived as saints."" Emperor Constantine appointed the group of converted Christians to high positions in many parts of his empire. Very aptly, historian Paul Johnson asks: ""Did the empire surrender to Christianity, or did Christianity prostitute itself to the empire?"" Constantine also extended many benefits to pagan priests who became Christian ministers but still practiced paganism . For example, they received monetary support from the Empire and didn't pay taxes. False teachings such as hellfire is partly the result of the political expediency and the crafty maneuvers of a pagan emperor-Constantine."	PRO	138

Sb471a2b7-A92875032	It is ethical for God to send people to Hell.	"Thank you for beginning this intriguing debate. Foremost, I believe that the definitions you are using are not sufficient and thus belie a good deal of logic in your argument. This is due to the fact that you use the Princeton Wordnet definition of the word ""Hell."" I bring this up not as a semantic argument, but as a logical one, as the only veritable reference one can use for Christian dogma is the Holy Bible -- although texts written by seasoned theologists might also suffice. Princeton Wordnet may provide a commonly-accepted and generally applicable definition, but it may not accommodate the specific definition provided in the Holy Bible. The main discrepancy in that definition is that it suggests that Satan has a good time living in Hell with his angels, while Hell was actually made for human sinners. In fact, if one were to canvass the Revelation, one would find that everyone is a sinner, but only those who reject Jesus Christ under God are cast into Hell. Satan is to join them in torment, rather than torment them himself: ""And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."" (Revelation 20:10). In fact, according to the Bible, Hell was made *for* Satan and his angels, and humans only go there if they choose to: ""Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS."" (Matthew 25:41). Essentially, God even *asks* those about to be cast into Hell to repent before it happens. Remember -- a man who lived in sin, a thief, was pardoned by God (Jesus) moments before he was killed. But, moving on... A1. In order to go to Heaven from a...land you in Hell. - Even in your citation, you offered no qualifier that one must *faithfully* (strict or thorough in the performance of duty -- dictionary.com) believe in God. Considering the aforementioned points, one can acknowledge God/Jesus at any time, and still find salvation. Furthermore, you have no logical or factual foundation for asserting that a good deed/bad deed ratio has no affect on one's salvation. The logic here is that if one were to choose to live a life of sin, it is most likely that one would die a sinner without repent. Why live your entire life in a way in which you do not believe? This sounds more likely of those who are religious than those who are not. A2. ""Now, let's say...THERE BE THAT FIND IT' (Matthew 7:14; Luke 13:23,24). - That biblical quote does not prove your argument as there is no indication that ""life"" refers specifically to ""Heaven"" -- especially considering that Heaven and Hell are places (or states) that one goes to (or assumes) after life. Heaven is most often referred to as ""Eternal Life"" in the Holy Bible. Also, I find it hard to believe that you are copying a direct quote, as a strait is a body of water, while continuity without curves or angles is spelled ""straight."" Consider the billion people in China who know not the Lord Jesus Christ! - You didn't know that there are Christians in China? - http://www.christianityinchina.org... Consider the countless hundreds of millions...who worship Allah and the prophet Mohammed. - It is said that Allah and the Christian God are one in the same. It turns out that Jesus is supposed to be considered synonymous with God, while the Judaism and Islam suggests that there are no human manifestations of God, and worship prophets instead. Consider the billion Catholics...Seven-Sacraments and good works. - This is irrelevant, as although that behavior could be construed as sin, it does not disqualify a soul from entering Heaven en lieu of Hell. Countless billions of people...their sins have not been forgiven. - 33% of the world is currently acknowledged as Christian. Not a huge proportion, but not 10%. http://www.religioustolerance.org... A3. Sinning is in our nature and is an innate process [3]. The ONLY way around sin is explained in A1. God hates sin [4]. - This is worded in a way that suggests that God set humanity up. This isn't quite the case. Humanity is full of sin, but that does not meant that God hates humanity: ""The Lord is...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."" (II Peter 3:9) - On the other hand, it is true that God hates sin, but that is not a qualifier for going to Hell. Rejecting God is. A-Arguments: As established in my A section, God absolutely hates sin. However, we are sinners by nature, it's not something we can control. - That, I also find a little misleading. Although we are going to sin one way or another (since it requires perfection to live an entire life without sin, and we are imperfect), this does not mean that we have a predisposition to sin. A simple analogy could be a typo. Although a typo is inevitable, it does not mean that we as typists prefer to, intend to, or have any inclination toward typos. Since God is omniscient...questionable on its own but to further my argument, I'll let it slide for the moment. - Adam's sin was following woman over God. Eve's sin was following Satan over man. I mean, one can consider that dubious when viewed through the lens of contemporary philosophical perspectives, but there is actually an explanation for this: God simply loved us too much to let us go. Repeated again and again throughout the Bible. Now, sin is just a factor in going to Hell, it's not the main reason. - Nope. It's irrelevant, as made apparent in previous arguments (on both sides). If it was, absolutely no one could get into Heaven. The main reason for going to Hell appears to be NOT asking for forgiveness and not correctly conforming to Christ. - How does one ""correctly conform to Christ""? Pro may wonder...even condeming serial killers or child molesters wouldn't be just. - Wtf? Even humanity agrees that condemning serial killers and child molesters is just here on earth. In fact, for many serial killers, we help put them in Hell. Hell is eternal punishment...After all, Jewish people don't go to Heaven because they technically reject Christ [5]. This ISN'T ethical. - If Jewish people don't go to Heaven, the Jesus went to Hell. I mean, He *did*, but He didn't stay there, is the point. Anyway, this is false. Although they reject the notion that Christ is God, that is a bit of a gray area. Christ is an avatar, an analogy of God, but He did speak to God while He was here on earth as a man, and He is regarded as God's son rather than God Himself. B4. God essentially sends you to Hell ...a being that is supposedly all-good. - That is an illogical simile. It is more akin to your children rejecting you after you dedicate your life to them. You'd want to kill those little bastards, too B-Arguments: I stated in my A-Arguments section that...he/she is still one of God's creations. - Not allowing someone to live in your home because they do not respect you should thus be considered likewise barbaric. Then why not somewhere else? Because our only options are Earth, Heaven, and Hell, and Earth is terminal. For God to intervene is for Him to remove free will, so I prefer He does nothing about it. This doesn't mean He likes it (see supra). As far as letting someone suffer -- if the love of your life got a disease from someone with whom she cheated on you, are you going to spend your last dime on helping her live? Conclusion: Ethics are subjective, but Con has made no viable argument that God's precepts for sending souls to Hell are unethical."	PRO	140
Sa2c55bd3-Aa8c3e48c	God is not real	"God is not real. For the ease of argument we will be debating about the Christian God The Bible The Bible serves as the word of God. As God is omniscient, we can infer that the Bible is completely correct using the rule of inference. Assuming that the God in question is benevolent and omniscient, why would God create Lucifer, supposedly the greatest enemy of God, if he knew beforehand that Lucifer would become a fallen angel? Why would God only create Adam in the beginning and wait for him to complain about being alone to create Eve? Why would God allow Satan entry into the Garden of Eden if God is truly omnipotent and omniscient? In the first few pages of the Bible, we as the reader are already presented with a cesspool of problems, all of which are contradictory to a ""benevolent, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient"" God. Apple as knowledge The apple in the Garden of Eden represents knowledge. When Adam and Eve were first placed in the Garden of Eden, they were ignorant to the point where they did not even know they were naked. When Eve eats the apple, after being tempted by Satan disguised as a snake, she suddenly realizes that she and Adam are not wearing any clothes. As a result, they are cast from the Garden of Eden for disobeying God's orders. Why would a benevolent God refuse knowledge to his creations? Benevolent or pure evil? In the Bible (which we assumed was 100% true), God states that those who accept him will join him in Heaven and those who don't will burn in the depths of hell. While my opponent and I are both fortunate to have access to resources that allow us to learn about God, what about those who don't? What about the people residing in countries where such knowledge is not available? Exceptions to this rule are not present in the Bible, thus we must assume that those people, regardless of circumstance are doomed to hell. Why would a benevolent God allow this to happen? The only logical explanation to all of this is that God is simply a figment of one's imagination. A creation of one's mind."	PRO	141

BURDEN OF PROOF My opponent tries to make the claim that he/she doesn't have the burden of proof. Well, according to this website, he/she DOES have the burdenof proof: From the Debate.org tutorial: ""The general custom is that an instigator that makes a positive claim, must provide evidence that the claim is true"" As a result, often it is much more difficult to argue as PRO then it is to argue as CON. Unless explicitly stated, CON does not have to prove that the resolution is false, just that there is not enough evidence to prove that the resolution is true."" [1] So as anyone cam see, my opponent has the full burden of proof. It was not specifically stated that I have to prove the resolution false, and its too late to add new rules now. I don't have to provide my own evidence, I just have to show that Pro's claims COULD be wrong. I have offered an unbiased source supporting this idea, while my opponent has only offered an opinion without warrant. My opponent COULD have crafted a resolution where the burden of proof was shared by both of us. ""Does Hell exist?""would be one example. Or, my opponent COULD have made a resolution where I had the burden of proof. For example, ""Hell exists."" My opponent COULD have taken the Con position on that one, and in that case, the burden of proof would've been on me. HOWEVER, Pro specifically chose ""Hell doesn't exist."", and took the burden of proof by doing so. LOGICAL FALLACY Most of my opponent's arguments are based on a logical fallacy, and as such, should be disregarded. Specifically, Pro has engaged in what philosophers call the ""argument from silence"": "" Argument from silence (argumentum e silentio) "" where the conclusion is based on the absence of evidence, rather than the existence of evidence"" [2] In short, abscence of evidence is not evidence of absence. So basically, Pro hasn't offered any valid evidence to support his/her position. MAYBE GOD IS BAD Pro tries to argue that a good God wouldn't create a Hell. Even IF this were true, it wouldn't mean that Hell doesn't exist. Maybe a bad god created Hell. Now that I have fully negated my opponent's claims, I turn this debate back over to Pro.

Sd63073be-A280a7019	The Many Worlds Interpretation can resolve the problem of Hell	Thanks for the quick response treyprice. ==Rebuttal== R1) The Double Spit Experiment This is an experiment in quantum physics where we get a refraction pattern from light passing through two slits. Then we shoot just one electron, and we still get the same refraction pattern, as if it passed through both slits simultaneously. Then when we try to measure which slit the electron goes through, the refraction pattern disappears, since by observing the electron, we fix its location in space time. My opponent claims that God is not affected by quantum physics, otherwise, if he was, he would affect quantum physics as being a universal observer. However, this would disprove God's omniscience, since he cannot know the location of electrons, or this would mean that we wouldn't ever get a refraction pattern from the single electron. It is my opponent's burden to show how this doesn't contradict God's ability to know all. Even if you assume that God is in both theoretical worlds simultaneously, the one where I go to hell and the one where I don't, as an observer, I personally will know which world I reside in and if I reside in the world where I go to hell, this still precludes the other from existing in THIS world, so God is still the one damning me to hell in this world. This still buys into my argument about empirical vs. logical possibility. My opponent wants to remain agnostic about all possible worlds, but only one of them will be the real world, as far as we are concerned. So it doesn't matter if in a possible world I'm not cutting your ears off for refusing to tell me who stole my cookie, empirically, I'm doing it for real in this world. My opponent never answers my argument that God must be necessarily omnibenevolent, meaning he is omnibenevolent in ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS. My opponent still concedes that there are possible worlds where he is not omnibenevolent. Look to his own Schrodinger's Cat example. Until we open the box, we don't know if the cat is dead or alive. However, we have already opened the box in this case - we know whether we have accepted Christ and if we have already gone to hell, we know the outcome already, so empirically, one of the possible states ceases to exist. Lastly, if my opponent is right, this defeats the purpose of God letting people choose whether to accept Christ or not in the first place, since he uses his omnipotence in other worlds to alter the course of events and change our brain psychology sufficiently so that we are essentially forced to accept Christ. Lastly, my opponent must assume a communal hell, that is the dumping ground for ALL possible worlds, meaning that if you're saved in one possible world you're saved in them all. This would defeat the purpose of hell to begin with in Christian doctrine, since it would have to be empty for my opponent to properly resolve omnibenevolence. This makes absolutely no sense.	CON	145
Sdc001e36-Aa0e5891b	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"My opponent, by claiming that wading through the lottery of religions makes unbelief in Christianity justified, has underestimated the work of the Holy Spirit and the power of an omnipotent God. Jesus said, ""No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him."" (John 6:44) The Father does not draw men primarily by the preaching of Christians, but by the witness of the Holy Spirit in their lives. Those who reject this witness have already received ample evidence of where the truth lies and are thus not justified in rejecting the truth. However, God does not need to draw every person in the world to him for being omniscient, he knows those who would obey him out of love for who he is, and these he draws. So knowing those whose hearts would reject him anyway justifies God in not going to the extremes my opponent suggests he should go to to prove himself, like appearing in the sky to the whole world and say ""I am God."" In fact, Pro only assumes without proof this would convince everyone. Many scientists would think it was an alien being, and ask how they could trust what it says. Others would become theists, but that doesn't show they would exercise faith in him and love him. God didn't want mindless robots, so he gave us free will; but Pro seems to think that God can MAKE people FREELY love him. This is a logical contradiction. Even if people only obeyed God out of fear of going to hell, that wouldn't mean they loved him in their hearts for who he is. And if people only obey God for the rewards, or to escape punishment, their worship will still be meaningless in his eyes. You don't want your children to pretend that thy love you, do you? So yes, no one freely chooses hell, but people freely choose not to love God and his ways. Some people prefer to cheat on their wives than to be faithful. Some people prefer to steal than to work hard for a living. So just believing in the right God is not enough to keep a relationship with him strong and get to heaven, one must love to do what is right and hate what is bad. I even find it odd that an atheist should argue that hell is immoral, because if God didn't exist there would be no immorality or morality, for human opinions of right and wrong would only the accidental spin-offs of socio-biological evolution, and I have no reason to think that a morality developed by animals ought to be correct. Morality without God would not be objective, so that you could justly condemn anyone. Love, justice, and compassion would only be aids to survival, but any deeper meaning would be illusory in a universe devoid of purpose or meaning. When an atheist says ""love your neighbor as yourself,"" he thinks he is referring to some standard above and beyond himself, but in doing so he holds to the Christian view that there is some transcendent lawmaker beyond human opinion. A sense that what is just and fair isn't decided by majority vote. I would ask Pro what is his basis for justice in a world without God? But he also argues that it isn't fair to torture someone in hell for a limited lifetime of sin, but that fails to understand the nature of hell. In the lake of fire, people are not only being tortured for sins in this life, but for sins they continue to commit after death, as they continue to hate God in their hearts for what he has done to them. The rich man in Luke 16:19-31 didn't repent, even though he was begging for mercy. And even if he did repent, he would not be doing so out of a sense of guilt for his wrong, or his love of God, but simply to avoid torture. This is no reason for mercy! I wonder how Pro knows that anyone genuinely converts after being in the lake of fire? If they couldn't appreciate the love of God in this life to move them into worship, what makes you think they will see God's love in hellfire? But again, Pro argues in a circle. His whole argument boils down to this: God is wrong because hell doesn't seem fair to me. This begs the question: what makes Pro think that objective morality, that is, standards that are binding on all of us rather we choose to believe in them or not, should be decided by him? How is it that his human view of what is right ought to trump God's? Just because he doesn't agree with God's reasoning, how does that make him right? Even if no human thinks God is fair, how does that make them right? Since when was truth, or better yet, justice , decided by majority vote? And by majority vote of lower beings at that? If God exists, it stands to reason even on common sense grounds that he would know better than us what is just, and he would also have the right to make the rules. So the only way to show that any human ideas of morality trump God's view of morality is to assume for the purposes of this debate that God doesn't exist. But not only is that an assumption without proof, its not even on the topic of this debate! Pro asked me is the Muslim God Allah sent me to hell for not believing Islam if it would be fair. Well, if Allah is the true God, and if I would have been willing to love him for who he is, he would have reached me in the same way the Holy Spirit reached me, giving me enough evidence to choose him if I so desired. If then I rejected him, he would be within his rights to burn me in hell forever. But let me also say something also on this matter of people going to hell because they didn't accept the right God. For while God has rules, got isn't an unreasonable tyrant. They are exceptions to rules. For example, Paul says that people who did not receive the law which the Jews had received at Sinai, the Gentiles, were still given the faculty of conscience, and God would basically judge them on the basis of the extent to which they were willing to follow the little truth they did know. (Romans 2:11-16) I am saying this to suggest, that babies who died in childbirth, or folks who suffered from mental illness and so forth will not be sent to hell just because they didn't believe. God knows if they ""would have"" believed were they in a position to hear the good news, and he also has the option of judging them on the basis of how they lived their lives. Its not all as black and white as you make it seem, and that is why most genuine Christians would not point fingers and say ""he or she won't be saves"" because Jesus is the judge, not them. Furthermore, while I believe people will experience being in literal fire in that lake of fire, scripture doesn't say they will ""burn"" forever, only that they will forever be that place which has fire burning. There may be occasions when they will not be in fire. In fact, Jesus taught here will be different degrees of punishment in hell, or gehenna (the lake of fire). He said it will be more endurable for some than for others. (Luke 10:12-14) The real anguish, even more so than the fire in that place, will be to experience forever total separation from God. So yes, no one consciously chooses to be in a place like hell, but the y do choose in this life to separate themselves from God, even though they may believe in him. Look how many people will tell you they believe fornication is wrong, yet they still do it. So the problem here isn't belief, its the heart condition. Those whose hearts would be acceptable to God, I have to reason to think he would not reach them effectively, and for you to say that he hasn't just because many people have not accepted him seems to imply your belief that you know for sure they would love and serve him if they were convinced the Bible was true. How could you know this? I have a Muslim friend who told me that even if the Bible was true he would not serve God, because any God who torture his own Son on a cross doesn't deserve worship. No God who accepts human sacrifice doesn't deserve his love. Yet he has no problem with all the lives that have been sacrificed in Islam's jihad's over the years! The very act that God used as the greatest expression of his love, sacrificing himself for us, taking on our suffering, he rejects. You, a mere human are in no position to say that God isn't fair when punishing people in hell. For his thoughts are higher than your thoughts, and his ways, higher than your ways."	CON	146
S3a24f2e9-A7bebba2e	Hell does not exist.	"Pro has brought up some excellent points which I will attempt to address. -Rebuttal of My Rebuttal- 1) Pro asked: ""What you are saying is that we reap what we sow, and sow what we reap?"" Yes, this is essentially a correct understanding of what I said. Humans have the freedom to choose how to live their lives, but those choices do have consequences. 2) Which leads us to the very last part of Pro's rebuttal: ""if we ever go to hell it is because we did not live a godly life."" According to the Bible*, this is not true. Simply living a godly life will not get you out of Hell. The Bible says ""For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord""(Romans 6:23 ESV). It also says """"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."" (John 3:16 ESV). We see clearly from these verses that people are free to choose between life and death (traditionally 'death' is seen as hell). 3) Now, moving back to the middle of Pro's rebuttal. ""What you are saying is that our Benevolent God created hell to punish sinners and non-believers...""I don't believe I ever said that. -Hell From Other Religions- This is an interesting but strange idea brought up by Pro. Here are the problems with it: 1) For this argument to work, it must be assumed that Christian beliefs are correct. If they are, then a Muslim who does not have salvation from Christ would not go to Muslim hell because Muslim hell is not a component of Christian belief. 2) Now let's make a different assumption for the sake of this argument. Somehow, this idea is what really happens. Someone who's belief system includes hell will go to this version of hell and have to be snatched away by God. What about someone who's religion does not include hell? Where would they go? Where would God snatch them from? 3) Back to assuming that Christian beliefs are correct. Pro stated ""there are 1.6 Billion Muslims alone. That's a lot of snatching from."" As was also stated by Pro, this is the Christian God doing the snatching. The God of Christians would have no problem snatching 1.6 billion people from anywhere. -Free Will- It seems that Pro does not understand what free will is, based on this statement: ""Obviously, it is not free will if there are consequences after you question the existence of the one who gave you 'free will'. It's like saying to your kid, 'You can do anything you want to do, I give you the free will to do so, but if you later rob a bank, and scold me for not being a good parent, I will roast you in our micro-wave oven'."" I would like to point out that consequences do not erase free will. If anything, consequences are on outline that makes free will more distinct. Consequences tell you exactly what exercising your free will get you, but your still free to exercise it. The kid in Pro's analogy still has the ability to choose whether or not he's going to rob a bank or question his parent even though he knows the end result of those choices. -Arguments I Should Have Made- Pro listed several arguments that I should have made back in round one. I appreciate Pro giving me ideas, but I had no need to look any farther than the base of your argument to see the flaw I needed to refute. * I realize that my opponent, and many who read this debate, may not believe in the inerrant quality of the Bible and do not believe that it should be used as a source. But, Pro's ideas of Hell and God and things like that seem to originate from the Bible (even if they've since wandered far from it), so this is why I will use the Bible as a source."	CON	147
S180be3b6-A8e3029c2	Eternal Punishment in Hell for thought crimes is unjust	Hello muslimnomore, this is my first time debating so I am not very good. I hope you will understand. I am not a Muslim, I am a christian, but the rule applies for both types of religion. Also, there is a hell for Christians too. So I will continue to go against your argument. I will be looking through the christian point of veiw (Muslim believes the first part of christian). God is the one who created us and he is the one who is under control. He wants us to love him as he loves us. This is one of the main reason he created us. Since god wants us to follow him, he gave us rules to follow and to keep him worthy of worship. He also told us not to worship other gods. Which human did break that rule which made our god mad. Even though god loves us, he still needs to punish us like our parents do when we do bad things. If we did something bad when we were young, we got punished from our parents. It is like the same thing. Even in the religious book, god tells us he is our father. Which makes perfect sense why god will do such things. God also told us not to believe that there are other gods. Our god have all the rights to be mad at us if we worship other gods because he is the real one. Since he created us he should be the one who is getting the praise. So if we don't follow our god and do bad things in our life, we should get punished. Of course god will get mad if we don't follow him, and if there is no such thing as hell, why would people not do bad things. We, as Christians don't want people to go to hell, so we try to prevent that by tell other people about it. Also, since there can't be any sin in heaven, they need to go to hell. Which is not a pleasant place to be.	CON	148
Se4a83ec6-A915aec6c	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"I would, once again, like to thank PopCulturePooka for issuing this challenge. I find it ironic that he claims my arguments are rife with problems when, in fact, it is Pro's arguments that are fatally flawed. I will, of course, point those out momentarily. However, Pro's claim that my exegesis has problems is just a baseless assertion, as he did not make his case (due to space constraints). I can say my exegesis is spot on which wouldn't prove that it is, but is no less valid than Pro's assertion to the contrary. But let me point to an example of a verse I quoted last round. In Matthew 25:41 Jesus says to those on his left to depart into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Eternal fire. I'm sure Con would claim that the fire is eternal and not the punishment, but what's the point of having an eternal fire that never goes out if punishment is only temporal? Why leave an eternal fire to burn long after the last punished souls are annihilated? I understand that space is limited, but I laid out a case for why Hell is eternal. A rebuttal of ""your interpretation is wrong"" doesn't work unless you can show why my interpretation is wrong. As such, I exted my arguments into the next round. God Cannot Stand Sin My objection here has not ""gone off the rails."" In fact, Con presents a false dilemma. Since God cannot stand sin, he has only two options: Allow it to continue forever, or annihilate all sinners. But there is a third option: Allow them to survive in a state that is completely separated from you so you don't have to be around it. For example, if my niece is bugging me so much that I can't tolerate her attitude, I can send her into another room or, better yet, I can leave the house altogether (provided there is another adult there to watch her). Saying that God is tolerating sin by sending people to Hell is simply untrue. Hell is complete separation from God. Sinners are punished and allowed to die in their sins, but God doesn't have to tolerate it because those sinners exist in a state completely separated from God. There is nothing incoherent about this. God Is Justice i) Even though Jesus died on the cross so that all may be forgiven, Jesus does not force himself on anyone. If somene wants to be saved, they must accept God's salvation. After all, God allowed His only Son to die a horrible death on the cross. Why would God save anyone why would God save anyone who wouldn't take Jesus' death seriously? ii) Actually, I never said that all sin was deserving of the same punishment (although Hell is eternal for all sinners). There are verses that indicate there are different degrees of punishment in Hell (Matthew 10:15, 11:22). So Hitler will be punished a lot more than someone who didn't commit mass murder but still died in their sins. In fact, Con has overlooked a crucial point in my argument. While even one sin is deserving of Hell (for example, Con brought up stealing a pencil), Hell is so heinous because we are all guilty of a lifetime, a multitude of sins in thought, word, and deed. Free Will There are no problems with the free will defense, as I will show. i) The boy who thrusts his hand into the fire despite having strong inclination not to did, in fact, make the free choice to do it. In fact, Talbott's argument actually proves too much. If we didn't have free will, then the boy would not stick his hand into the fire because he had strong inclination not to. The fact that we can act contrary to what we know is right, or how we were raised, is strong indication that we do, in fact, have free will. I have known people who know what Hell is and yet still reject God. It happens. It may not be in their best interests, but they may, in fact, believe they are acting in their best interests. Some have deluded themselves into thinking that Hell is one big party. Even though one can make the case they are not accept the true reality of Hell, if you try to explain to them what Hell is really like, they may not believe you. And often times when someone rejects a reality, it is because they can't face that reality. In that case, they are freely accepting Hell, but they are also freely accepting a skewed version of Hell as a way to cope with their decision. We also see people freely rejecting Christ in the Scriptures. Jesus even weeped over Jerusalem whom Jesus wanted to bring them under His wing but didn't, because they were not willing (Matthew 23:37). Even someone like Dawkins can be said to be ""freely rejecting"" God. He may claim that God is morally bankrupt, but this is because he doesn't understand God's actions. He sees the same things we do in the Bible and considers them evil. He is rejecting God because he doesn't understand God's nature. He still sees the same God we do. ii) Free will is sacrosanct because if God were to controvert free actions, then we would not actually be free. Additionally, we could not be held accountable for our actions if we were not free to do them. If I have no choice but to do good, then rewarding me is useless. If I have no choice but to do evil, then punishing me is cruel. The very reality of Hell attests to the fact of our free will. Now, there have been times in which God has superceded free will. This is because God had a grander plan that couldn't be interrupted or changed (for example, no one could have changed the fact of Jesus dying on the cross because this was an event that was necessary for God to redeem mankind, and He has predestined this event to happen before humankind was even created because by God's foreknowledge, He knew that we would sin and need a Savior. But these events are the exception, not the rule. We cannot truly be free if we have no choice but to do good or evil, and we would not be responsible for our actions. The problem with the analogies of irrationality is that an irrational person is not responsible for his actions. He doesn't know what he is doing. Sinners know what they're doing when they sin. Even if someone refuses to see the truth, they are still accountable for rejecting the truth. Rejecting the truth doesn't just mean saying ""no thanks"" and walking away. It can also mean believing an alternate worldview as a convenient way not to have to accept the truth. The Bliss of the Saved i) Again, this is another exegesis issue. My claim should not be dismissed because Con is misrepresenting this verse. God doesn't take pleasure in the death of the wicked. I said last round that it's not something to rejoice in or find comfort in. But God is still eternally happy in Heaven despite the fact that sinners are going to Hell. Con has not actually refuted my argument here. He has merely tried to sidestep it. ii) Con's reason for dismissing Norman Geisler's words are unfounded. He gave a valid reason for why we can be in happy in Heaven, by showing that we can be happy eating despite knowing there are starving people in the world. This does not undermine the bliss of the saved. I look forward to our next and final round."	CON	149

S63d14e3c-Ac7a74380	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	1) Catholic church believed long before Nicaea council that hell existed. For example it is reported that Polycarp was condemned to be burned by fire. Before his martyrdom here were his words : “You threaten me with fire which burns for an hour, and is then extinguished, but you know nothing of the fire of the coming judgment and eternal punishment, reserved for the ungodly. Why are you waiting? Bring on whatever you want.” 2) About the pagan belief. It is true that pagan like platon did believe in hell and here was the reason. Pagan people were observing the world and noticed that good people were sometime having hard times even they were practicing some kind of justice. And bad people had a good life even tho they were doing wrong actions. So they came to the logic conclusion that bad people since they werent punished in our world had to be punished in the afterlife. 3) About pro still arguing on the hell/sheol word. Lets put aside the word hell and you will still see example in Jesus words that he was talking about an eternal punishment. Matthew 25: “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. ... Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. So now pro need to come out with a translation trick for the word punishment if he still wants to deny the evidence.

S7e9ab92-Af600b7df	Is Hell Forever? (In Christianity)	"Listen, When I have said ""Also eternal doesn't really mean ""lifetime or an era"". Think about it. According to the Bible, God literally created everything. He created the universe and even time. And the thing is, God may have said ""eternal"" in his perspective because He's the one who created everything. Continuing on, we know that God will never die because He's a perfect being. So this could literally conclude that eternal must mean forever. (However, the only way to eternal to die is if God dies. But God would never die, so basically we could see that eternal literally means forever.)"" this is not my opinion. It is plain logic. But not only that, there are evidences that supports it. Let's make this more visual: 1) God is real. (Given from Round 1) 2) So, the Bible is real. 3) From step 2, we can soon say that God created everything. - ""For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things have been created through Him and for Him."" (Colossians 1:16) 4) We also know that nothing was created before God. - ""Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."" (John 1:3) 5) This could also mean that God created things using His perspective. (I mean, what other sources could He have used to create anything. It was merely His imagination and His perspective.) 6) Knowing this, we could conclude that He created ""eternalness"" in his perspective. But not only that, in God's perspective eternal is forever to him, because He will always live forever. 7) So eternal means forever. I would like to give a big shout-out to I_just_plant_the_seed. I have to admit, he did give out a good point and I do agree with him. I would like to say that you cannot look at the bible literally. Perhaps, eternity may not literally mean forever. However, from the context of the Bible, not every single thing should be taken literally. For example, when I have said ""He grew tall as a tree,"" do I literally mean that, that person grew talk as the same height as a tree? Or do I mean that he just grew taller. The second choice is the most reasonable answer. Just as this scenario, the bible shouldn't be taken literally. These two website explain thoroughly of why the bible should not be taken literally. (Thank you I_just_plant_the_seed for these sources.): http://bib.irr.org... https://discovertheword.org... So face the truth: You keep looking at words in it's literal point of view. However, not everything in the bible should be taken literally, but figuratively. This soon proves my point that eternal does mean forever, too. However, that was the small stuff. Let's get in the juicy stuff. You said ""No coming back from it... Eternally not existing... "" But not only that, you specifically said ""eternally not existing"". And the thing is, you're not existing WITH GOD. But not only that, you have said eternally. Which context are you using for this word, ""eternally"". Is eternal in this sentence mean forever, or a lifetime? Because I'm pretty sure you're using this word ""eternal"" as in forever. But above all you never support sources for this claim: You keep saying Im contradicting my argument.... I am not... I am saying it is eternal because you are destroyed... No coming back from it... Eternally not existing... Not existing in itself is a punishment... Destruction means just what it implies you still can't back up your argument of destruction and suffering forever are the same thing."" Because this claim raises so many questions and with no sources, this claim is totally worthless. Also, I do agree that destruction and suffering aren't the same thing. However, from the bible, they show the same concept that is held in hell: PAIN. So this is my conclusion: 1) The bible shouldn't always be taken in its literal term. 2) Eternal does mean forever. 3) Hell is forever These are my questions for you: 1) After round 2, you NEVER supported sources from the bible. Why? 2) Please explain your reasoning of why the bible should be taken literally. From these reasonings and explanations, my arguments and claims are still solid and strong. Due to this, hell is indeed forever. I would also like to say, thank you Pro, for having this debate. I have learned so much and this was a great opportunity for me. Thank you very much for having this debate. I wish you luck as the voting period will begin. Best wishes, Jason P.S. Wikipedia is not a good source."	PRO	156
S33e77a7f-A39f69e94	yes there is a heaven and a hell	God meant for all men to have fellowship with Him. He made man and woman in His image and gave them a mind and spirit to communicate and even to know Him. He also gave them freedom of choice to get to know Him or not. (after all what kind of a friend would you havet if they were your friend because you forced them?) same thought with God He wants us to want to know Him. After Adam(and Eve) did not listen to God he was expelled from the presence of God.. Satan also was expelled from the presence of God.And God allows him to be in the world until he will be cast into the lake of fire in hell. (hell was made for him and his demons)God set about restoring the relationship between man and Himself. And since there was no one to bridge the gap between man and God (no one perfect) God sent His son, Jesus to stand instead of us before a just and Holy God. Jesus took on all our sins(missing the perfect mark-definition of sin) and gave His life for us. And then rose from the dead disarming all the satan’s power. Satan is heading for hell with his demons, but God is reaching for man and woman to fellowship and know Him. Now the ball is in man’s court – if he chooses God then he goes to heaven and has fellowship with God- if he chooses to go away from God he goes to hell with satan and the separation from God is many times worse than any death.

The main one however is Job 14:12 which states ""so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.""[1] This shows how when you die and are to be sent to Hell you wait in Hades, which also translates to the grave, but can also be known as purgatory by the Catholics. I find it highly unreasonable to take Revelations simply as a vision, and to use it as a guideline as to the events that shall unfold. Revelations is not written simply as a vision but is meant to be taken as an account of the events that shall unfold. When a person dies that is to be sent to hell they wait in Hades until the day that god returns for his people, at this time during the seven years in which multiple plagues and events will unfold those people that were in Hades will then be moved into hell for the duration of those seven years, after which when the angel from heaven locks Satan into the abyss, those in Hell will proceed to the lake of fire. This is explained exactly in revelations as you can see in my source above. And since it is my job in this debate to prove that you can indeed leave hell it seems quite apparent that you can leave. For the main point that hell only exist for seven years in a sense. Yes it does indeed exist before gods return but those people that have died on earth have not yet proceeded to arrive there, as they are in Hades. Then they proceed to reside there for seven years while the anti-christ rules over the earth. Thereafter they will be thrown into the lake of fire even before Satan. Thus, they leave hell.

Romans 6:23 DEATH not eternal torment psalm 37:10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. will be NO MORE...

BE STUBBLE, NOT A ROOT NOR BRANCH WILL BE LEFT TO THEM.... suggests destruction... You shall trample the wicked, For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet On the day that I do this, Says the LORD of hosts. Malachi 4:1-3. it says they shall be ashes... as in nothing left of them.. Behold, they shall be as stubble, The fire shall burn them; They shall not deliver themselves From the power of the flame; It shall not be a coal to be warmed by, Nor a fire to sit before! Isaiah 47:14. It says they shall be stubble... like nothing... The LORD preserves all who love Hims, But all the wicked He will destroy.

Obadiah 1:15-16. it says it will be like they never existed... so they are destroyed you said: ""Matthew 25: 46 says ""These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."" From this citation, we could see that people who believe in Jesus and in God would go to heaven, while the people who don't suffer in hell, eternally. But not only that, this verse is told by Jesus, Himself. He really does a good job explaining how punishment and suffering in hell is everlasting as being eternal with God."" well. The punishment of the wicked is eternal. God will destroy them, they wont suffer forever! they will cease to exist FOREVER, that is a punishment... not existing is punishment... they wont suffer forever. The same book of Matthew said ""Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell."" it says he will DESTROY both the body AND soul in hell. DESTROY.. - ""And these will pay the penalty of ETERNAL DESTRUCTION, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"" (2 Thessalonian 1:9)."" you brought that up... it says eternal DESTRUCTION as in the will be destroyed and cease to exist, as in the will eternally not exist. i await your argument :D"	CON	161
Sd0a95b68-Adf049c46	According to Christianity, babies will burn in hell.	"Thank you! I'm very new here and I want to learn from some real pros! xD My Arguement My argument is fairly simple. It's based off several biblical texts. Let's look at some guidelines for how to be accepted into heaven, according to the bible. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. -John 3:18 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. -John 14:16 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. -Romans 10:9 From these verses I'll use a syllagism. Premiss 1: All christians go to heaven. Premiss 2: Anyone who is not a christian goes to hell. Premiss 3: Premiss 1 and 2 relate to all human beings. Premiss 4: Babies are human beings. Premiss 5: Babies are incapable of declaring with their mouth, ""Jesus is Lord"". Premiss 6: Babies are not christians. Premiss: 7: Babies will burn in hell. I will presuppose that my opponent will object primarily to premiss 3. My reason for saying all human beings are subject to the tests described in the verses above are words like: whoever and no one. The verses do not describe beings who are above a certain age or who have reasonable intellectual function. It describes all humans unless con can prove otherwise."	PRO	162
S7e9ab92-Ab428d5d5	Is Hell Forever? (In Christianity)	"First thing is, I don't think you understand the text in the bible clearly. You said, ""And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Matthew 10:28"" The word ""destroy"" in this context doesn't mean to literally DESTROY somebody. It just means that He is able to make people who don't believe in him feel SUFFERING and PAIN. And destruction also doesn't literally mean destruction and breaking apart somebody. As the word ""destroy"", the word ""destruction"" means to make someone feel pain and sorrow, too. Please think deeply, and stop rushing. You are misunderstanding words. Please stop it. Also, you said ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23"" This verse only talks about how every person would die, and that if you accept the gift of God, then you would spend eternity with God. This verse has nothing to do with hell and its eternity You also said ""Psalm 37:10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found."" You misunderstood another verse again. The verse it talking about how later in the future, sin (the wicked) would be washed from this Earth and never be found again. ( The CEV version of this verse is ""Sinners will soon disappear, never to be found,"") Also, you said ""But the wicked shall perish; And the enemies of the LORD, Like the splendor of the meadows, shall vanish. Into smoke they shall vanish away. Psalm 37: 9-11, 20."" Do you know what Psalm 37 is even about? I don't really think so. In this chapter, David talks about in the present day, about how the evil are prospering, while the goods were suffering. That bible verse you quote was just talking about how in the future, evil should be gone, be banished, from the Earth. But not only that, it talks about how the good would prosper and the evil would soon suffer oin the future Earth. So please think. You also said ""But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; The future of the wicked shall be cut off. Psalm 37: 9-11, 20, 38."" Again, this bible verse is trying to say how the evil would be gone from the Earth in the future. (And don't get me wrong, I understand from the Bible that the future would be clean from evil. However, I do know from the Bible that people who are still in hell, would continue to be in hell.) Also, you said ""As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. Psalm 68:2."" This verse basically means God would kill these people who don't believe in him and put them in hell for eternity. You also said ""May sinners be consumed from the earth, And the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD! Psalm 104:35."", it's like the scenario earlier. According to the Bible, Jesus would come down to heaven and make Earth a perfect place. This verse is just talking about how the earth would have no more sins, because Jesus would make everything right again. There would no more sinners in the world, but hell still exist with people suffering in eternity. And as for your rest of you supporting arguments, they aren't supportive. You've misunderstood all of the verse, and none of these verses truly show the meaning of how hell isn't eternity. (All your verses really just show scenarios of what would happen to evil on this earth when Jesus come down from heaven. None of your verse really explain how hell isn't eternity, but only explain how evil will be gone from the Earth and that the people who don't believe in God would die and go to hell.) Like I said earlier, I do know that there would be no more sins in this world because Jesus is to make everything right. However, hell continues to exist and people continue to suffer in eternity. Now let me go to your contradictions of my claims. You said ""well. The punishment of the wicked is eternal. God will destroy them, they wont suffer forever! they will cease to exist FOREVER, that is a punishment... not existing is punishment... they wont suffer forever."" This statement what you have said is completely absurd. Why? Well, first you said, ""the punishment if the wicked is eternal"". Do you know what the punishment is in the Bible? Well, it's SUFFERING according to the Bible! Saying this, and admitting that the punishment of the wicked is eternal basically makes you lose because that totally contradicts your claim which is that hell is not forever. Suffering is basically punishment, according to the Bible! But not only that, because you have said ""The punishment of the wicked is eternal"", this also contradicts the rest of the sentence in the quotation which is "" they won't suffer forever! they will cease to exist FOREVER, that is a punishment... not existing is punishment... they won't suffer forever."" And if you don't believe that punishment from God is suffering, check out this website: http://www.bibleinfo.com.... Knowing this, all my supporting claims for my argument is still firm to the ground. Oh, and here's another bible verse I found about the eternity of hell 2 Thessalonians 1:9: They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might I wish you luck for the next round, and I can't wait to hear you soon.

S553a1156-Ac013335b	HUMANITY IMMORAL/DESTINED to Hell at BIRTH	"Apparently Con cannot READ! Having provided 0 evidence to prove the actual existence OF MORALITY as stated in the text, Con has already FAILED to comply at ALL LEVELS. Having No proof for Morality at all, merely as requested ""not to do"" comes to the fro with complete opinion. Having begun with scathing retorts while blantantly disregarding all rules outright? I hardly think you Con have any place from which to speak of Debate etiquette. Then as if not complying with the initial rules to not accept on the grounds of sole opinion, he proceeds to do the exact same thing with the scriptures of the Holy text, in DIRECT VIOLATION of the texts he quotes himself? That all may know his error I site the three scripture violations Con defies at onset! Proverbs 30:6 Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar. Deuteronomy 4:2 Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you. 2 Peter 1:20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. That any living soul dares to violate with impunity scriptures outright how then can such a one also dare to presume correct applications of said scriptures he quotes while clearly in defiance of the very Text he purports to quote? Thus Con is a deluded believer at most, a pending doomed Soul at worse considering the guaranteed curse that is to be applied for daring such a feat, against a Living God? .... Revelation 22: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. it can only be hoped that Con is a SAVED soul, as such a one has no condemnation pending, merely a forfieture of REWARD and Sonship as stated in 1 Corinthians 3:14 & 15 1 Corinthians 3:14 If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. 1 Corinthians 3:15 If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved--even though only as one escaping through the flames. That remaining to be seen, we proceed; Let us scrutinize Cons violations with care and concern ... as Con expresses TOTAL OPINION with the intent to decieve? Con states-Con can simply take the stance that it's left very ambiguous and this makes Pro fail their Burden of Proof on that latter Resolution. Clearly flawed intellect in that Con readily states non existence- Note the term AMBIGUOUS am·big·u·ous adjective: ambiguous ( open to more than one interpretation; having a double meaning. unclear or inexact because a choice between alternatives has not been made. There IS nothing to be ambiguous on ... it IS or ISN't, not a maybe ... otherwise is it not merely an OPINION? I submit my fellow readers- IS it even possible to PROCLAIM a Person TRUTHFUL ... if he IS KNOWN to LIE on occassion? Clearly one need no Degree in the sciences to recognize a person who Lies on occassion is a NOT TRUTHFUL at ALL. What of Morality itself? Are you GOOD, when you cheat, steal, lie ONLY ON OCCASSION? Usually good? IS NOT GOOD! Therefore as in the exmple above the Person IS IMMORAL in CHARACTER, how can this be denied? Well yes he IS moral, only having adulterous affairs every blue moon? INDEED! No, No, He IS TRUTHFUL .... mostly. uh-huh! Have YOU ALSO gone to the extent of ignorance that Con finds himself? Need I refresh your memory of what the english language says is true? TRUTH- (of a person or statement) telling or expressing the truth; honest. does it state .... occassionally? Moral-concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character. the extent to which an action is right or wrong. (does this state on occassion?) Thus Con was IMMORAL in accepting this debate under FALSE pretenses ... HE LIES! Complaining of the nature and Structure of the debate, then in BLATANT VIOLATION of the debate rules himself. Had He merely placed them IN the comments section he would have been at the very least correct, if not dishonest in the USE of opinions only! Knowing full well, he POSSESSED NO EVIDENCE to the contrary of the topic! OPINIONS are not evidence, to include personally interpreted scriptures carried out of context, and completely devoid of truth! Revelation 14:10 10 he too will drink the wine of God’s anger, poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented in fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever. Day and night there will be no rest for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”… Behold the Word ... unlike Con I will ""NOT"" tell you what to believe ... i shall do as REQUIRED by scripture ... to present the Gospel as told to do in Mark 16:15 15And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.… see if you can underline the part where it says to tell you WHAT THE SCRIPTURE MEANS? Not there is it! Con failed to do this HE TOLD YOU what to believe (and it's WRONG) Cons blashemy- Here are a couple of verses that tells us that God judges us for actions in our actual body,and not for the 'original sin' as some would have us think: Cons blashemy- These 2 verses simply help to imply that God likes to protect the little, the vulnerable children: God never IMPLIES ... he states or he does NOT state! it is expressly forbidden for Believers to IMPLY in the scriptures, that is ADDING or TAKING AWAY from the scriptures, by the adding of HUMAN PERCEPTION! Just out of curiosity? Have you ever wondered ... if THERE'S ONLY ONE GOD? WHY is there 43,000 Christian Denominations in the World ALL claiming to be right? Ever wondered this? Cause I can tell you the exact reason and TRUTH if you want to know it ... but it's really off the subject. I'll include it in my next response if somebody really wants to know the REAL ANSWER! But for now onward we go! Con states-I ask Pro to explain why you cannot repent and change your ways and why a single act, thought or feeling that can be associated with morality negates all the good and morally positive actions, thoughts and feelings humanity possesses. SINGLE ACT? yeah we all have ONLY a single act. OPINION and not even a realistic opinion con. Nobody only is immoral ONCE in life ....DUH! Just gonna fantasy your way through this huh? Con states-I'd also like to point out that if Pro takes that angle that morality is entirely subjective and doesn't really exist, it is them who cannot uphold the resolution as it necessitates morality to be real. READ the TOPIC FOLKS- HUMANITY IMMORAL/DESTINED to Hell at BIRTH Con states-Are We Destined to Hell at Birth? The Bible strongly suggests that the burden to prove oneself as moral increases throughout life and thus the reverse of this is that we are born capable of entering heaven and our sins from birth onwards are what can destine us to Hell. Again con attempts to TELL YOU what to believe BEFORE he uses scripture. I on the other hand am OBEDIENT, therefore I will just SHOW YOU what God says about the subject! 1 Corinthians 15:21-23 21For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. 23But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His coming, those who belong to Him.… Before I place the next scripture look at the ending of the statement? I remind you of Cons lies. Con stated- It's easy to think that the default is evil since Adam and Eve sinned but Jesus died specifically to counteract that sin making all from that point on neutral from birth. Now LOOK at the ending statement? and identify Cons lie for yourself! Here Read it yourself-those who belong to Him.… IF Con was RIGHT? ALL SHOULD belong TO HIM, this statement would NOT have been necessary ... if Jesus DEATH NEGATED Adams judgement of death upon Humanity ... WHY is THIS STATING FOR THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM? You don't KNOW Jesus do you? Then you DO NOT BELONG to Him ... you SEE? Means HELL IS WAITING for you to DIE, each day, every day ... no exceptions, except myself as a Believer who BELONGS to Christ, My Brethrens who also belong to Christ, and maybe Con, if he is merely a denominationalist ... then he's completely wrong BUT SAVED, cause Salavation IS FREE! Oh yeah the other scripture on the REASON your going to Hell ... Romans 5:12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned-- SEE, God ISN'T sending you to Hell ... your GOING to Hell because your Adams kids! And as the scripture points out-Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, So quit saying a LOVING God would NOT send a person to Hell! Now you know God isn't sending you there ... you were GOING THERE at Birth BECAUSE OF ADAM, not God. God IS the one who has made a WAY for you to be RESTORED TO HIM! BUT? YOU have to go TO HIM to get it! Capish! Most just go the Athiests route ... IF I DON'T BELIEVE ... it won't be TRUE? UUUUUH ...... YEAH, that IS one way to go?"	PRO	164
S63d14e3c-A64faabcb	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	"Acts24:15-""""And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."" If there is hell fire, why will God resurrect the unjust ? John11:25-""Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"" Hosea13:14-""I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes."" Revelation20:13-""And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their work."" These scriptures underscore the indisputable fact that when humans die regardless of their sinful state -wicked or righteous- they both go to the grave. When its time for the resurrection,both the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected and judged.So where is the place of torment ? 1Corinthians15:12,22-""Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.But now Christ is risen from the dead, the first fruits of them that sleep:For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive"" Christ was in hell(grave) for three days.Everyone goes to hell. Hell is a common grave. It is not a place of torment.Righteous men like Abraham,David and Job went to hell. Psalms 103:9-14 -""The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger forever.He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust."" In line with this scripture, how come a God ""who will not keep his anger forever"",""plenteous in mercy"" and "" who has removed our transgressions from us"" punish unconscious dead bodies forever in a fiery torment? I reiterate dead people are unconscious and cannot feel any pain.They cannot be tormented. Appreciating Bible symbolism helps sincere bible readers to understand what Jesus meant when he spoke figuratively.Jesus used hyperbole liberally in his speech.Sadly, portions of scripture are quoted to argue against a point when in reality the entire context of the passage is ignored.Although there are 66 books in the Bible, it is in harmony from Genesis to Revelation. The bible doesn""t contradict itself. Every bible passage is part of a broader context. No wonder theologians caution against building elaborate doctrines on obscure passages, or doing so by only referencing passages that appear to agree with your dogmatic doctrine, while ignoring other significant passages that oppose it. The false doctrine of eternal torment has turned many churchgoers into atheists. Some christians are paralyzed by fear.Their hypocritical worship of God is grounded on a morbid fear of a loving God who has been sadistically misrepresented as a cruel monster who burns unconscious dead people in a fiery place forever. In conclusion, hellfire is not a biblical teaching.It has pagan origin. Hell like Hades(Greek) ,Sheol (Hebrew)and Gehenna (Greek) are words referring to a common grave. @Truthseeker01- I am glad you accepted the challenge. I still stand my ground-Hell is not a fiery place of torment."	PRO	165

If the things you assert are as sure as hell, then you and all you are referring to are doomed to hell, correct? Or do you not believe Hell is a place of fire where rebels agaisnt God are punished? The debate here is supposed to be about the reality of faith, not a diatribe of Con's bitterness about the condition of the world. By faith, Con types words to post for an argument. Con shows faith by typing, believing the words typed will be posted in this debate after the proper buttons are pushed. Faith is acting in belief.

S553a1156-Ab935b0e6	HUMANITY IMMORAL/DESTINED to Hell at BIRTH	"The Debate's Design is Quite Sneaky and Unfair To Con It is interesting how this debate's resolution is laid out. It's as if Pro has given themselves two ways to win whereas Con is burdened with having to fight both at once in order to win. I am not complaining because I know exactly how to debate against both, but I do think it's unfair and in some ways bad conduct to engage in a debate where you have 2 routes to debate, only one of which has to be won and you get the win while your opponent has to win at both (and you are the one who designed the debate that way, not just accepted another's flawed design). The Idea That Immorality is Digital, as Opposed to Analogue, Is Something That Has Yet to Be Proven Pro advocates that morality is something which humans either possess 24/7 or not at all. It's as if the moment you act, think or feel immoral things you then cannot repent for your sins or lead a moral life from that moment forth. Since it would be a trap for me to use the Bible against someone who has not yet stated the Bible to be absolute truth, I'm not going to quote the Bible verses (of which there are many) that directly support the idea that morality is analogue, having many measurements along the scales of immoral actions, thoughts and feelings all of which can be repented for and your level of morality or immorality increased or reduced later on in life regardless of earlier actions leading up to that point. I ask Pro to explain why you cannot repent and change your ways and why a single act, thought or feeling that can be associated with morality negates all the good and morally positive actions, thoughts and feelings humanity possesses. I'd also like to point out that if Pro takes that angle that morality is entirely subjective and doesn't really exist, it is them who cannot uphold the resolution as it necessitates morality to be real. Are We Destined to Hell at Birth? Since I assume this is not the Hell of Islam, considering Pro's username and references to Jesus as 'Christ', I am going to go into the Bible's Hell and references to links between our moral state as babies and children. The Bible strongly suggests that the burden to prove oneself as moral increases throughout life and thus the reverse of this is that we are born capable of entering heaven and our sins from birth onwards are what can destine us to Hell. These 2 verses simply help to imply that God likes to protect the little, the vulnerable children: Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."" (Matthew 19:14, NIV) ""Beware that you don’t look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father."" (Matthew 18:10, NLT) Here are a couple of verses that tells us that God judges us for actions in our actual body, whether good or bad and not for the 'original sin' as some would have us think: ""For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."" (2 Corinthians 5:10, NIV) ""And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it."" (Deuteronomy 1:39, NIV) It's easy to think that the default is evil since Adam and Eve sinned but Jesus died specifically to counteract that sin making all from that point on neutral from birth. So does a being neutral in morality automatically go to Hell or to Heaven? This is up for debate and it is Pro who claims to know that it is Hell, Con can simply take the stance that it's left very ambiguous and this makes Pro fail their Burden of Proof on that latter Resolution."

Sdc001e36-Aa2cc75b	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"Thank you, Daley. I will try to address as many points you made within the 10,000 character max. ""However, God does not need to draw every person in the world to him for being omniscient, he knows those who would obey him out of love for who he is, and these he draws. So knowing those whose hearts would reject him anyway justifies God in not going to the extremes my opponent suggests he should go to to prove himself, like appearing in the sky to the whole world and say ""I am God."" In fact, Pro only assumes without proof this would convince everyone."" Con has suggested that God does not give extremely compelling evidence to people (like appearing in front of them for a conversation) because God knows that they would reject him anyway. He suggests that everyone who goes to Hell is only there because God didn't seek them, which in turn is because these people would supposedly never love him under any circumstance. But you cannot deny that if God were to appear to everyone in the world and talk to them, the percentage of Christians would skyrocket to a huge majority of the world. Sure, there would still be that 1 or 2 percent of people who would deny such compelling evidence, but approximately 98 percent or more would not even question the existence of God if he would only appear to them. You don't see many people questioning whether or not their friends exist because people directly see them and have conversations for good amounts of time. You will find that it would be the most logical choice for God to appear and put an end to this pointless lottery of religions. If he only were to talk to us, the Christian population would skyrocket until there were only a few doubters left. But the only reason God doesn't give compelling and indisputable evidence is because he is either illogical, doesn't care about the souls he will save if he simply talks to them, or isn't real in the first place. I believe in the latter. ""And if people only obey God for the rewards, or to escape punishment, their worship will still be meaningless in his eyes. You don't want your children to pretend that they love you, do you?"" Let's explore this a little deeper and compare God's relationship with us to a Father's relationship with his child. So for this analogy, I am a Father who has a son. I leave my son in a house with a number of my other children who are all scrambling to find out which version of Daddy is the right one. When they grow up to leave the house for me to judge them, I judge them based upon which version of me they chose to worship. I don't really judge them based upon whether my offspring behaved morally or raped or killed anyone, but instead I judge them based upon whether they love the correct version of me. If they love the correct version of me, every sin is forgiven. When I find that they have chosen the right book and the right version, they get to come to a party for the rest of their lives. When I find that they chose the wrong book and the wrong version to worship and love, I put them in the oven and cook them for the rest of their lives. I don't kill them. I don't forgive them for an understandable mistake. And I don't ever let them die to leave their torment. In fact, I specifically created that oven so that my children will never die while they are burning alive. I don't let them out of this oven ever, because any attempt for the children to redeem themselves is just an attempt to avoid torture. Any sane human being would say that in this situation, the father is a sick sadistic human being who is in no way morally perfect. So why do we believe differently about God? I don't understand how simply not loving him could ever logically or morally warrant being tortured for the rest of time. The only person who deserves torture in this scenario is the father who tortured his children himself. It doesn't matter whether the father claims to be morally perfect or not; Torturing someone for not loving you is one of the most arbitrary, cruel, and repulsively immoral acts one could ever do to a person. There is no reason that a supposedly morally perfect being would ever decide to torture anyone for eternity much less for an insignificant thing like someone not loving the being. ""I even find it odd that an atheist should argue that hell is immoral, because if God didn't exist there would be no immorality or morality, for human opinions of right and wrong would only the accidental spin-offs of socio-biological evolution, and I have no reason to think that a morality developed by animals ought to be correct. Morality without God would not be objective, so that you could justly condemn anyone."" Does God prefer his moral values because they are objectively good, or are those moral values simply good because he prefers them? If he prefers his moral values because they are objectively good, then morality exists independent of God. This means that objective moral values exist whether or not God exists. If you instead believe that moral values are good simply because God prefers them, then you are subscribing to Divine Command Theory and falsely equating power with morality. Just because God has omnipotence does not mean in any sense that what he does is good. Might does not make right. To even suggest that power and authority dictate morality is to say that morality is flexible and only determined by whoever has power. If God preferred torturing babies rather than comforting them, then that would be good according to Divine Command Theory. DCT is completely wrong because morality is not determined by authority. If objective morality does exist, then it exists with its logical reasons independently of God. My basis for justice in a world without God is a mixture of logic and consideration for suffering. In order to have the right kind of morality, a person must be completely logical and most take into account the suffering of people. Viewing morality this way, one can logically come to the conclusion that torturing someone for the rest of time does not better the person, does not teach them a lesson, and goes way beyond what retribution they would ever deserve. The only logical reason for a man to torture someone for eternity would be to satisfy his own sadism. This renders God either sadistic or illogical. ""But he also argues that it isn't fair to torture someone in hell for a limited lifetime of sin, but that fails to understand the nature of hell. In the lake of fire, people are not only being tortured for sins in this life, but for sins they continue to commit after death, as they continue to hate God in their hearts for what he has done to them."" My opponent has just argued that it is immoral for you to hate God for torturing you. He also suggests that people are continually tortured in Hell because they hate God for torturing them, which then brings more torture upon them and in turn makes them hate God more. That is one of the most morally repugnant statements I have ever heard someone say in defense of Christianity. He asserts that not only does God torture people for not loving the correct version of him in life, but he continues to torture them because they hate him for torturing them! This shows the irrational and immoral thought process that leads people to believe Hell is justified. Because my opponent thinks that God is morally perfect, he must rationalize and justify the doctrine of Hell which is inherently immoral. This creates cognitive dissonance and leads him to think that God torturing someone for eternity is somehow justified and morally acceptable. In reality, torturing someone for an infinite amount of time for simply not loving you should be seen as a morally atrocious act. ""You, a mere human are in no position to say that God isn't fair when punishing people in hell. For his thoughts are higher than your thoughts, and his ways, higher than your ways."" Con finishes here with an argument from authority. He basically says that I am wrong because God is perfect and omniscient, therefore everything he does is justified. This authoritarian view of morality asserts that whenever someone""s personal logic contradicts the authority, their logic is wrong instead of the authority in question. Authoritarian morality has been used by countless people throughout time to justify their God's seemingly immoral and irrational decisions. For example: I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster as my God. The Flying Spaghetti Monster is very fond of killing and torturing babies. But this is not immoral, and we should not question the Flying Spaghetti Monster because he is morally perfect and omniscient. Since he is morally perfect and omniscient, he is in a better position to decide whether or not killing and torturing babies wrong. Any mere human who questions this is wrong because the Flying Spaghetti Monster's ways are mysterious and higher than our ways. The reasoning in that example has justified a dehumanizing and disgusting act by simply asserting without evidence that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is omniscient and morally perfect. Con has asserted no evidence for the idea that his God is omniscient or perfect, but still asserts that no one can question his God because of this. This is merely an attempt to end the debate by appeals to authority, so this argument and any arguments appealing to authority should be considered invalid in any debate. Hopefully, I have shown in my responses everything that is wrong with Hell. Torturing someone for all of eternity makes the person act even worse, makes them suffer infinitely for finite crimes, and most importantly only serves to satisfy God. God could easily annihilate the people's tortured existence, or even forgive them and give them a chance at redemption. But instead, he purposely makes it so that they will live the rest of their immortal existence in agony and fear. I am running out of characters, so I'm sorry that I couldn't address everything."

Sedfad01e-A488598e1	The Problem of Evil and Hell	"Thank you for a swift response. I'm highly impressed with your arguments and am very glad to be debating you on the problem of evil and the problem of hell. -->Rebuttal to Theodicy<-- My partners theodicy is basically the doctrine of original sin. However, the major problem is that it is contradicted in the Bible. Indeed, it is unjust to be punished for the sins of Adam and Eve. Says who? Well, if one must appeal to authority, the Bible! Proposition 1: God is love. (Agape) [1] Proposition 2: Agape keeps no record of wrong. (1 Corinthians 13:5, ""It (love) is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. NIV) Axiom 1: If proposition 1 is true, then God cannot keep any record of wrong. Axiom 2: Consequently, God has no ground to stand on to punish those who rebel against him; especially if it is a wrong that was committed by a different person thousands of years ago. Proposition 3: ""The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself."" (Ezekiel 18:20) Proposition 4: (Deuteronomy 24:16) - ""Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin."" Axiom 3: Consequently, is unjust for God to put the original sin of Adam and Eve upon us. Conclusion: The theodicy fails because God cannot keep any record of wrong and the doctrine of original sin is contradicted in the Bible. -->Case<-- I. Problem of Hell I wish to take a moment to expand on the Problem of Hel that I couldn't finish in the previous round. Proposition 1: There exists a God who is omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Axiom 1: Consequently, this God is able to: (1) Save people from hell; (2) Create a punishment that is not the equivalent of hell; (3) Not create people who is going to hell; and (4) Already knows and purposefully decided who is and who is not going to hell (per the doctrine of predestination). Contention 1: The porportion argument Imagine someone who died during the holocaust; for example, Anne Frank. Anne Frank is in hell (at least according to Christian doctrine) because she rejected Christ as her saviour. Likewise, Adolf Hitler is in hell for the same reason. Anne Frank died roughly one month before her killer, Adolf Hitler. Consequently, she has been punished for the same sins as Adolf Hitler for a longer period of time. Contention 2: Finite sins, infinite punishment? What crime deserves an eternity of punishment? It is impossible for one to commit an infinite amount of sins because we are finite. Consequently, we are given a far greater punishment than one is warranted. Putting it all together: Why hell is wrong My partner is sure to respond, ""Who says the above is wrong?"" Well, first I wish to argue against the Divine Command Theory (DCT). I) The dillema 1. Ether (a) The good is willed by God because it is Good; or (b) The good is good because it is willed be God. 2. If 1a is true, then good is independent of God's will. 3. If the above is true, then God is not the creator of good and evil. 4. If 1b is true, then good is contingent and subjective to God's will. 4. If the above is true, there is no objective standards of morality with the DCT. 5. The DCT is false. So, we go back to the original question: What creates morality (this is very important to the subject of hell and the PoE). I contend that morality has a naturalistic orgin which can be explained from the framework of Evolutionary Psychology - a discipine formally known as Sociaobiology. In his book, The Rejection of Pascal's Wager, Paul Tobin makes the following notes: [2] Human Universals Most Likely Evolutionary Mechanism Affection Expressed and Felt Kin Selection & Reciprocal Altruism Altruism and cooperation Attachment Kin Selection & Reciprocal Altruism Familial bonding and friendship Classification of Kin Kin Selection Basis for knowing degree of relatedness Empathy Kin Selection & Reciprocal Altruism Moral sense Distinguishing Good and Bad Reciprocal Altruism For judgment, distinguishing cooperators from cheaters Fairness Reciprocal Altruism For equitable reciprocity Food sharing Kin Selection & Reciprocal Altruism For altruism and cooperation Generosity Admired Reciprocal Altruism Finding out who can be trusted in transactions Judging Others Reciprocal Altruism To ensure that cheats are known. Prohibition of Murder Reciprocal Altruism Prevention of the ultimate cheating Pride Reciprocal Altruism To enforce the individual's action in his group Redress of Wrongs Reciprocal Altruism To make cheating unattractive Shame Reciprocal Altruism To prevent individual from resorting to cheating From the above chart, it is clear that our moral values was brought about by process of evolution. There is a mathematical formulat to describe this phenomina: C<BxR C=Cost of helping B=Benefit to the recipient R=Degree of genetic relationship between altruist and recipient. This equation tells us that as long as the cost to the altruist is less than the benefit to recipient times the degree of related between the true, the act of altruism makes sense. [3] Conclusion: Morality is nothing more than our evolutionary instincts working together. These same ideas were found in other animals as well. Asking ""why should one be moral"" is the equivalent of asking ""why should one feel hungry."" Paul Tobin once again hits the nail on the head: ""Moraity is a part of human nature and...an effective adaptation. Why should we forego morality any more than we should put out our eyes? [4] Conclusion Based upon the values that humans share via evolution and instincts, we can determine what is right and what is wrong. II. Problem of Unecessary Suffering (evil). I.

S393ece2c-Af160fe2d	The Problem of Hell Redux	"I thank my opponent for their response and shall continue. Before I begin my defense and refutation, I want to bring us back to the actual debate at hand. In round 1, my opponent stated their position to be hell is incompatible with Christianity (1). Christianity is entirely based upon the Old and New Testaments in the Bible. Christians believe the bible is the infallible word of God. Therefore, any scriptural references provided are infallible, according to my opponent's guidelines. Defense 1: Free-will Ethics: principles that govern a PERSON'S or group's behavior. We cannot apply a human ethical system to something which is not human. This is not saying man can know nothing about God because, since this is arguing from a Christian perspective, the Bible conveys truths about God and these truths are what we know about Him. God is not human. You cannot apply human ethics to God nor can you apply human rationality to something non-human. Man chooses their fate quite simply, if they have faith in God and love God, they go to heaven. If they do not have faith in God and do not love God, they go to Hell. God could force man to ""love"" Him. Would that truly be love? God wants man to consciously choose to love Him. If you choose not to God is not going to force anyone to be with Him. They made their decision. God loves all man, even those who do not love Him back. He will not force anyone who does not want to, to be with Him for all eternity. My opponent argues God cannot entrust man to make decisions about our own fate. But, I have provided several passages which must be considered INAFLLIBLE for the scope of this debate proving my point. God HAS entrusted man to create their own fate. My opponent continues to apply a human morale scale to something which, most assuredly, is not human. Christianity believes God is not human. Therefore, people cannot apply human morals to God. People choose their own fate, whether or not this is moral by man's standards has absolutely no relevance when it comes to something which is not man. To God it is moral or he would not do it. God is completely righteous (or justified) in all that He does (2, 3, 4, 5,6). God is completely just when it comes to Hell. He does not sentence people there. Man sentences themselves. God does not just ""sit back"" as my opponent suggests, if God had just sat back and done nothing. Then there would be no Bible. There would be no Jesus Christ to save man. There would be no prophets. There is a Bible, Christians believe Jesus Christ did come to save man, and Christians do believe there are prophets. Furthermore, Man chooses to go to Hell by choosing to deny and not love God. If a rational person does not accept God, they are accepting Hell. Man does have all the facts, God has shown He is true love, Heaven is true bliss, and Hell is true suffering through the Bible. If a person chosen to not love God then they can blame nobody but, themselves. Man has all the tools for their decision. If they decide to not love God, they have decided to go to Hell. D2. We cannot apply human ethics to God because God is not human. We cannot make any assumptions about God other than those seen in the Bible. Which God revealed to man. The truths I stated in my opening argument were the ones revealed to man through the Bible. Pro attempting to apply human ethics to God which assuredly cannot be done. God is not human. D3) Memory God does not erase memories of bliss, only pain. In heaven, Man does not know what pain is. They cannot perceive pain in any way. They have forgotten what it is. My supposition is the Biblical position, and thus the Christian position, on this matter. You forget ANYTHNIG which pains you going as far as not knowing what pain is and you only know joy. This is supported multiple times in the Bible, my opponents suppositions are not. Sources: 1. Round 1 of this debate 2. Psalm 33:4 3. Nehemiah 9:7-8 4. Psalm 45:6 5. Psalm 89:14 6.

S393ece2c-A5679737d	The Problem of Hell Redux	"Introduction I have already done one debate on this subject but I hope to tackle this issue again. [1] To reiterate, my position is that the existence of hell - conceived of as eternal, conscious torment (e.g. the ""traditional"" doctrine of hell) - is, in all likelihood, incompatible with the existence of a God who is conceived of as perfectly good (e.g. just, merciful, loving, etc), powerful, and wise. I think this problem presents a uniquely diffcult issue for that kind of monotheism in general and Christanity in particular; the latter position is the one I will be arguing from. One's theological or religious persuasion - whether theist or non-theist - does not matter in accepting this debate. The only type of person I hope to debate is someone who is competent and can argue powerfully for the position that the existence of hell and God, within the context of Christainity, are, in all likelihood, compatible. I accept the burden of proof inasmuch as all the opponent has to do to defeat me is show that my arguments fail to prove their conclusion. If they show my arguments do not prove their conclusion the argument points should go to my opponent. Thusly, my opponent has to show how and why my arguments fail.

Se4a83ec6-Af5be08a8	The Problem of Hell Redux (2)	"Con's elaboration of the ""biblical case"" for a traditional conception of hell (by citing Matt. 25:41) relies on a dubious use of the word ""eternal"". In Greek the word translated as eternal is aionios. ""Aion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri ouravou, i. 9, 15) said, “The period which includes the whole time of one’s life is called the aeon of each one.” Hence, it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one’s life (aion) is said to leave him or to consume away (Il v.685; Od v.160). It is not, however, limited to human life. It signifies any period in the course of the millennium, the mythological period before the beginnings of history. The word has not “a stationary and mechanical value” (De Quincey). It does not mean a period of a fixed length for all cases. There are as many aeons as entities, the respective durations of which are fixed by the normal conditions of the several entities. There is one aeon of a human life, another of the life of a nation, another of a crow’s life, another of an oak’s life. The length of the aeon depends on the subject to which it is attached.…The adjective aionious in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation….Aionios means “enduring through” or “pertaining to a period of time.” Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods….Out of the 150 instances in LXX, [Greek Old Testament] four-fifths imply limited duration. For a few instances, see Gen. xlviii. 4; Num. x. 8; xv. 15; Prov. xxii. 28; Jonah ii.6; Hab. iii. 6; Isa lxi. 17.4"" [1] God Cannot Stand Sin Con says I present a false dilemma and says that his third option solves it. Hell is complete separation from God. Not only is this very awkward to say in light of traditional Christian claims about God - isn't God supposed to be omnipresent? - this is very awkward to say in light of the bible. Presuming Con's hermeneutic we have this text: ""A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: ""If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,10 they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury,which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb."" (Rev 14:9-10) One could make a good case for it involving a lot of metaphor and symbolism - it is Jewish apocalyptic literature after all - but one thing is clear: God is an active presence and facilitator here in the ""torment"". I don't see any ""separation"" here. Con says that God shows that He doesn't tolerate sin by sending them to hell (""complete separation from God"") but what Con's claim have him committed to is by the act of sending them to hell God guaranteeing that the sinners will sin in perpetuity because God is the only one who could break that cycle of sin. If person A sets up a situation wherein they punish person B for continuing to do something bad C(because it's intolerable to them) even though A has rigged the game to where B literally has no other option than to C it makes no sense to say that A finds C intolerable. They can't really find C that intolerable if they don't let B have an option to do something other than C. And therein lies the problem. Con has it that God tolerates the intolerable. Or that God stands the thing that can't be standed. God Is Justice i) Con's response here is largely irrelevant to this debate and largely has to do with other issues in Christian theology. ii) Con never SAID that all sin was deserving of the same punishment but that's what his arguments imply. Con quotes Jonathan Edwards who also argues elsewhere that every sin is worth ""infinite demerit"". This is what the whole argument presupposes. But if that is the case; If EVERY sin is deserving of eternal or infinite punishment (""infinite demerit"") then there's seems to be no coherent way to dole out ""degrees"" of punishment. It doesn't get any worse than infinite demerit, which all sins supposedly equally deserve. If that is the case there is no principled way to distinguish lesser from greater crimes (following the logic of the argument). Free Will i) Con misses the point of the analogy when directly responding to it but in another part seems to ""get it"" which is curious. Here we have a normal boy - meaning he has normal pain receptors and a normal aversion to pain and every thing else - who has every reason not to stick his hand in the fire and no reason to put his hand in the fire (he literally has no motive) who, nonetheless, put his his hand in the fire. Can even be coherently said that this boy ""freely chose"" to stick his hand in the fire? No, because that level of irrationality is incompatible with freely chosen acts as Con implicitly sees when he says, ""The problem with the analogies of irrationality is that an irrational person is not responsible for his actions. He doesn't know what he is doing."" Exactly! That's the entire point I was driving at. Unrepentant sinners couldn't possibly know what exactly they are doing because they have no idea what they are choosing in the long run. It's hard to see how any human can truly grasp that. It'd be like leaving it up to a two-year old to decide to whether or not doctors should operate on a life threatening brain tumor they are developing. They clearly can't grasp the magnitude of the decision nor the complexities. This segues directly into the dilemma I posed for Con which he failed to address adequately. A human being would be like that boy in which if they knew the actual nature of hell they'd have the strongest inclinations possible not to choose it and no inclinations to choose it. If they chose it regardless of this it'd be in such an irrational state that itself it would be be a ""free choice"" (if its is one at all) they couldn't held morally responsible for. That's one horn. The other horn: Con himself says he knows people that have ""deluded"" themselves into thinking choosing hell is in their best interests. The key word is ""delusion"". And again with Dawkins when says something like, ""The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction..."" (everybody knows the rest) it's clear we aren't even talking about the same God anymore. He's no more freely rejecting the true God than he is rejecting a morally odious caricature of the true God (rightly, I might add). ii) Again Con fails to adequately address the point. Nowhere did I argue that free will isn't valuable. It is. I'm asking why is it that it is supposedly so sacrosanct when we come the choice of choosing eternal destinies? The choice the unrepentant sinner would be making would be to harm themselves in the worst way possible over the longest period of time possible. Why, per my analogy given earlier, wouldn't a good God step in and override their decision if they were about to make (literally) the biggest mistake they ever could make, ever? The Bliss of the Saved i) I'm not seeing how my previous objection still doesn't apply. The exact issue is whether such a doctrine of hell is compatible with other claims Christians make. To just say that he is eternally happy doesn't do much. ii) Geisler's claims fail for multiple reasons but the biggest one is this: ) His claim that ...""if we have tried to feed them but they have refused the food..."" presumes a free choice in rejecting God and/or choosing hell which I have strenuously argued against and Con has failed to negate. Con's objection to this argument rests in large part on his objection to my other argument about free will. If he can't defeat that one (and I've shown why he can't) then he can't defeat this one.

Sa53f9c67-Aa5ca2328	Hell would be a better fate than Heaven	"So my opponent has been making the same mistake in his arguments over and over again. He provides a reason why heaven bad, but doesn't show how hell is worse. His points are to make heaven sound worse than most make it out to be, but he doesn't show how hell makes up for what heaven can't. If the debate topic was "" Heaven is not all it's cracked up to be"" then your points would hold more ground, but comparing a sub-optimal heaven to a worse hell does not make hell the superior choice. So, in his closing statement, my opponent threw in a last point to finish off his arguments. However, like most other points he has made, I can easily throw it back at him. Pro point: Heaven would be worse because you would have to live with knowing others are burning in hell for reasons that are not justified. Con counter point: There are two things wrong here. However one is debatable depending on how you would define heaven. That point being that if a person such as a loved one went to hell and you went to heaven, you would still be able to be with them. If heaven is in fact a personal paradise, Then it would make sense that your paradise would include that person. You wouldn't know that your loved one went to hell because you'd be spending time with him/her in heaven. Even if said person is only a ""clone"" of the one that actually is burning. This argument is up to interpretation as heaven could not actually let you be with some one in hell, but since no tests have been done, this is inconclusive. A more sturdy argument is one that my opponent just made. How can you be happy in heaven knowing others are burning in hell? Allow me to answer this question with another. How can you deal with hell knowing you and other people are burning in hell? My opponent's statement doesn't make hell better, it just makes both worse. In one scenario you're depressed because your loved ones are suffering, in the other you're depressed because your loved ones are suffering, but now you are too. I think I made a strong case here. Pro should have focused more on what makes hell better, not what makes heaven bad. Though, I doubt there were many actual arguments for that criteria. For the side he was on, he did a good job.

Sedfad01e-Af3ce1793	The Problem of Evil and Hell	"I empathize with Pro's struggle to work within the 8000 character limit. It was the very reason I asked for a four round debate, since I was certain we'd approach that limit in every single round. I hope four rounds will invite more DDO readers. The Problem of Evil A. The Argument Map It appears my opponent provides this map as a background to the history of this argument. I do hope he does not intend that this map constitute his argument in this debate, as in so doing, he risks cheating the character limit. If he insists I have to refute this map to win this debate, then I will take that as permission to write a 50,000 character response, capture it as an image, and paste it into my round. That being said, I see no problem in referring to it throughout this debate to help illustrate his arguments. I do not believe my objections are accurately depicted in the map anyway. B. The Argument in a Nutshell Pro's second image breaks my heart. It sadly depicts how some Christians actually live, treating Christ like a cosmic personal assistant. Thought the Church in America has become very inward in many ways, there are also many Christian ministries actively involved in the troubled areas of the world. My church supports missionaries living deep in Mexico despite the increased cartel warfare. We fund a surgeon living in Africa providing lifesaving surgeries to the poor and destitute. Locally, we support The Hope Center, a place where young single mothers can get the help they need to get back on their feet whilst ensuring their children are cared for along the way. We're just one church supporting a handful of ministries. It's not much, but we strive to do our part. I hope the readers can agree that such emotional imagery serves only to distract us from the purpose of this debate. Christians might be petty, ignorant, apathetic, or even downright mean, but that seems to be possible of any people regardless of belief. We should not allow the feelings generated by such images to poison the well before we've even had a chance to objectively examine the evidence. C. The Argument Formulated 1. If God exists, then he is necessarily omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (by definition). It is true that God has all these qualities, presuming we aren't adhering to interpretations of these terms that render them intrinsically impossible. However, it's worth point out that God is also ""most just"" by the definition I provided in my first round. Perhaps benevolence implicitly includes justice, and that's fine, so long as we recognize that being just is indeed part of God's definition. 2. If proposition 1 is true, then unjustufied [sic] evil will not occur. I will agree with this premise. Given God's characteristics, we would not expect unjustified evil to occur. 3. However, unjustified evil does occur. I contend that this premise has not been properly demonstrated to be true. Pro defines evil as ""unecessary [sic] suffering."" I defined it in my first round as ""morally bad or wrong; wicked."" Like I said, I expected the definition to be disputed, but I will now explain why Pro's definition cannot prove his case. suf·fer·ing [1] n. The condition of one who suffers; the bearing of pain or distress; an instance of pain or distress. (The American Heritage® Dictionary) The pain, misery, or loss experienced by a person who suffers; the state or an instance of enduring pain, etc. (Collins English Dictionary) Pro's definition of evil is ambiguous. How does one objectively determine when suffering is unnecessary? The Problem of Evil is arguing for the reality of God's non-existence, so we need a way to identify real unnecessary suffering. But the term ""suffering"" involves entirely subjective experiences such as pain, misery, and distress. My daughter is certain she is experiencing unnecessary suffering when I deny her dessert after not eating her vegetables, but it is hardly objective truth. Consider Pro's four examples of evil. I think just about everyone agrees they are appalling. They all involve intense suffering. But what makes them unnecessary? Pro's opinion? Pro must give us some way of objectively identifying his examples as unnecessary. Author C. S. Lewis writes: My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of ""just"" and ""unjust""? . . . What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? . . . Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too—for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. . . . Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. In other words, Pro's lack of objective criterion for unnecessary evil means he can only assert, at best, the following premise: In my opinion, unjustified evil does occur. This, of course, does not reach the desired conclusion. Pro needs objective evil to make his case, but this is problematic for the atheist, as Alvin Plantinga notes: Could there really by any such thing as horrifying wickedness [if there were no God and we just evolved]? I don't see how. There can be such a thing only if there is a way that rational creatures are supposed to live, obligated to live. . . . A [secular] way of looking at the world has no place for genuine moral obligation of any sort . . . and thus no way to say there is such a thing as genuine and appalling wickedness. Accordingly, if you think there really is such a thing as horrifying wickedness (. . . and not just an illusion of some sort), then you have a powerful . . . argument [for the reality of God]. Not only does Pro have an uphill battle when it comes to showing us that unnecessary evil is a reality, but he risks making a case for God's existence in the process. 4. Therefore, it is probable that proposition 1 is false. Pro has failed to show that Premise 3 is true, and so the conclusion cannot be reached. The Problem of Hell Although my opponent was not able to discuss this argument in detail, I will go ahead and state now that it suffers the same issues as the Problem of Evil. Namely, the second premise states that Hell is an unjust punishment. The natural question to that proposition is, ""Says who?"" Microsuck? America? The Universe? In order for this argument to reach an objective conclusion, Pro needs to show us that Hell is objectively unjust. Theodicy The question will surely be asked of me, ""How does Christianity deem all suffering as necessary?"" Or, ""How can Hell be justified?"" I will give a brief theodicy, but note that I have already fulfilled my burden of showing the Problems of Evil and Hell to be unsound. When Adam and Eve sinned, they chose their own answer to the questions ""What is right?"" and ""Who am I?"" They revolted against God, essentially saying ""we don't need you."" If God let them rebel without consequence, he would not be just. So, he gave them one: He cursed the earth. Thus, all suffering is necessary as it is the consequence of saying, ""Leave us alone, we can make our own way."" As a result, all humanity inherited both Adam's guilt and corruption. Adam's choice to do things without God meant he would raise his children without God. Consequently, his offspring would then be born in sin, and so on throughout all generations. ""But wait, such consequences are not just!"" cries the atheist, to which I respond, yet again, ""Says Who?"" Sources http://www.thefreedictionary.com... http://www.thefreedictionary.com... C. S.

S158e26da-Ac16f6ff	what we commonly believe to be hell is not place of torment	Sheol, Gehenna, Hell, all the same thing? I will rebuttal very little of my opponents arguments because as I will show, they actually support many of my arguments. The only thing I will be disagreeing with is his conclusion which is that Sheol and Hell are one of the same thing. The bible uses three terms to describe the afterlife(besides heaven) which are Sheol, Gehenna, and Hell. Lets go on and define them. Sheol- noun (in hebrew theology) 1. the abode of the dead or of departed spirits.(1) Gehenna- Ge·hen·na (g-hn) n. 1. A place or state of torment or suffering. 2. The abode of condemned souls; hell.(2) Hell- hell (hl) n. 1. a. often Hell The abode of condemned souls and devils in some religions; the place of eternal punishment for the wicked after death, presided over by Satan. b. A state of separation from God; exclusion from God's presence. 2. The abode of the dead, identified with the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades; the underworld.(3) As you can see, Hell is both Sheol and Gehenna. It is both the abode of the dead and a place of eternal punishment. So which version of Hell is used in the bible? Both. In the Hebrew Scriptures, Hell always meant Sheol since there was no afterlife in Jewish culture. It is only in the New Testament that Hell gains the new meaning of eternal punishment, or more specifically, Gehenna. All that die now go straight to Sheol as my opponent said, but when the day of second judgment comes, all the wicked will be cast into Gehenna. Gehenna is the lake of fire as used in the bible but is translated as hell in the NRSV. Do the scriptures back up my bold claim? Lets see… “and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.”-Acts 24:15 What does this mean? That there is clearly going to be a resurrection of ALL the dead in Sheol. But why would there be a resurrection? Lets look at Revelation 20:11-15 “And I saw the dead…..and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things….. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”- Revelations 20:11-15 This scripture shows how the resurrected dead will be judged and those not found in “the book of life” would be cast into the lake of fire which is Gehenna or Hell. Gehenna is the second death. Hell, a place of torture? My opponent claims that hell is not a place of torture, but what does the bible say? Lets see… “And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. “ Mark 9:43-48. “And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.”- Revelation 20:10 Please do show how the above does not show hell to be a place of torture. Revelation even goes on to say that they would be tormented day and night. Why did Jesus and Job go to hell? 1)It is commonly accepted that Jesus died for our sins. So in a since, you could say Jesus took our place in hell. 2) An alternate explanation is that Hell talked about after Jesus death was Sheol. 3) Job is written in the Old Testament which always referred hell as Sheol. Conclusion While my opponent is right in his arguments about Sheol, he has really only told half the story. Sheol is a temporary place until the day of the second judgement comes when they will be cast into Gehenna. Hell as commonly believed, is indeed a place of eternal punishment.

Sdc001e36-A58468266	Hell is immoral and unjustified.	"Pro thinks that if God appeared to all mankind that 98% of them would become Christians. They would become theists, but that doesn""t show they will become Christians. Believing that God exist doesn""t make you a Christian, and believing that the Bible is true doesn""t give you a relationship with him. Jesus healed the sick, raised the dead, and the nation still rejected him. And likewise today Christian organizations feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless and still their message is not lived out by most people receiving their care. A magnificent appearance of God in the sky won""t stop people from preferring a sinful life. Even angels in the presence of God turned against him, what then about us? To illustrate my point, look at how many professed Christians you know who don""t practice what they preach. Even people who believe the Bible still choose to rebel against God, and they are not a few, they are many. So even if God proves he exists to the whole world, that doesn""t show the world will chose willingly to obey him out of love. Even if they obeyed him, it will most likely be out of fear of punishment. This isn""t the kind of worship God wants.. Like those who prefer sex outside of marriage. So no, God""s appearance won""t make the world into genuine Christians, not from the heart. It won""t make them love his way above what their sinful flesh desires. Many men will prefer to look at a naked woman than God""s glorious appearing. In Pro""s illustration of Daddy and his kids, he leaves out the part where after the ones who are saved because they accept the right version of Daddy are informed that now that they have a clean slate, they cannot practice rape, murder and so on again, or they too will burn. So Christians don""t get to heaven only on the basis of believing in the right God, but on how they live up to his standards afterwards. They must right the wrongs they have done as much as they are able, and if they killed someone, they must willingly turn themselves into the authorities to serve the time for their crimes. Christians must own up to what they did. And as for what Pro calls ""an understandable mistake,"" I wonder, do you think that rejecting your claim that hell is unjust is an ""understandable mistake"" on my part? I doubt you do, because you made the information available to me. And God has made the information about himself available to the whole world not just in the Bible, but by sending missionaries, using TV broadcasts, the internet, tracts, and even visions and dreams, and conscience. God can speak directly to anyone, but he doesn""t force people to love him. Most people have no excuse. It""s not like they have not heard. And Muslims, for example, have heard the criticisms of their religion and choose to turn a blind eye. No, its not a mistake for most of us, it""s a choice; just like when most religious people choose to reject evolution, it isn""t because they don""t know what evidence you have for it; its because they don""t like it. People who don""t want to have to live like a Christian won""t accept it even if it""s true. This comes down to love of truth versus love of darkness. Now Pro claims torturing someone for not loving you is immoral. How do you decide what is moral and what is not? This is an emotional argument, not a logical one. Because you don""t like it, then it""s wrong. You make your own feelings the measure of justice and truth. But if God attaches greater importance to loving him than he does to your personal happiness, what is it that makes him wrong for doing so? I am sure you know that moral values do not exist outside of consciousness. If all humans and animals vanish off the earth, and a rock falls and kills a mouse, is it evil? Where is morality? But because we can think, we can experience a realm of moral values, and the question arises: where do these moral values we apprehend come from? Well, it is only because an eternal being (God) has always existed, that such moral values exist, and God prefers these values because they are part of his very nature. It is because God is loving that love is objectively good, it is because God is just that justice is objectively good. And these moral values were not invented by God; so God didn""t arbitrarily decide to make any action morally right or wrong. Rather, lying, for example, was always morally wrong, and God didn""t decide to make it wrong, he merely revealed it was wrong. This standard cannot exist independent of God as Pro suggests, because it is only wrong because God""s character is truth, the opposite of lies. So God""s character itself is the standard for all moral behavior. So again I see Pro falling on his own sword. If hell is immoral, than objective moral values exist. But if they exist, their source must transcend mere human opinion, for human opinion is relative. Just as humans disagreed on whether slavery was right, so my opponent and I disagree on if hell is right. If there is a supernatural source of moral values, it gives that being the final say on what is right and wrong, and if this being, God, says that hell is part of his justice, who then are we to disagree? To disagree is to create another source of morality, and I dare Pro to tell us what it is. For I don""t see any morality being an accidental byproduct of evolution, as being anything more than subjective opinions. Pro argues that logic and consideration for suffering is the basis for morality. Well, its logical for a minority to suffer for the benefit of the majority, so using logic would very well justify any mistreatment of minority groups to benefit majorities. Its logical to pull the plug on the sick who are taking up valuable resources that can be better utilized by the healthy. Logic was used to justify eugenics, slavery, and all kinds of suffering. Its logical to force five young girls into pornography because the millions gained from he hundreds of thousand of perverts who will buy the videos, will go to provide free medical aid to thousands of sick patients. Sacrifice of the few to benefit the many is logical. Does logic make it fair? Logic can tell you if suffering was necessary, but not if it is just. What seems logical to one person, doesn""t seem logical to others, so in cases like this, how can logic be a decided of truth, let alone justice? Millions of people think it is illogical to believe that life spontaneously appeared out of non-living material, some like yourself believe in abiogenesis. How do you decide whose logic is the right one? Do you count hands? Then we are back to deciding truth and morality by majority vote. So again, I challenge Pro to try it again, and tell us how he even gets morality without God. He cannot! He knows he cannot! Yet wants to accuse God of being immoral when sending people to hell as if his opinion was an objective determiner of truth. Pro, could it be that we humans are so emotionally incensed at human suffering that we are unable to objectively condemn hellfire? We seem to have no problem with the suffering we do to animals when he kill our livestock, or experiment with animals in the lab. We justify it by saying it serves a purpose, but if God has an even greater purpose for sending people to hell, what makes you think you would be privy to those reasons? How do you know, that a being with infinitely more wisdom and knowledge than you, could not have reasons unknown to you, why he created hell in the first place? How can a speck of dust in this vast universe argue with God as if we comprehend his outworking of the bigger picture. Honestly, as an ant cannot see the big picture from our point of view, I think we can only graze the surface of God""s reasons, for he is far more than us than we are over the ants. Pro said: ""The only logical reason for a man to torture someone for eternity would be to satisfy his own sadism."" I wonder if rats in the lab are saying a similar thing to themselves when poked with instruments. The difference between God and us is bigger than the difference between us and rats; so how does he know we would even comprehend all of God""s reasons or be privy to them? Who are we to argue with God? Pro argues with my authoritarian view of morality, but unlike human dictators who could be wrong because they don""t know everything and are not the very source of moral values, God himself couldn""t be wrong because he does know everything and is the source of moral values. So if God, the very source of morality, was ever wrong, then how can Pro or anybody else ever be right? On logic? Whose logic? How is Pro""s logic any better than God""s? The same atheists who have made these arguments on how immoral hell is were equally involved, side by side with religious fanatics, buying and selling slaves during 400 years of African slavery! They themselves change in their human opinions, and what is considered right today by them, will not be considered right years from now as they continue to change as they always have. Pro argues that I asserted without evidence that God is omniscient and morally perfect, but that is part of the very definition of God; any being who isn""t omniscient and morally perfect can""t be God. What""s more, if he demands that I prove God has these qualities, would that not be a subject for a different debate? Pro, are we debating the morality of hell on the assumption that God exists, or are we debating the morality of hell AND the question of whether or not God exists? If you wanted a debate on the existence of God, you should have said so. When sin separates someone from God, God suffers the pain of losing that one forever. They too, will experience pain forever. Sin has eternal consequences either way."	CON	184
Sa350b670-Aa97aceef	never leaving hell after judgement	"Thank you for arguing with the Christian perspective as that is what I intended this debate for. To bring attention to the arguments being given between Christians on this issue. However, when you say ‘Biblical side' if you mean a side purely from the bible, then no. I am a Methodist and try to follow the Methodist style of taking from 4 things for our conclusions. Reason, Tradition, Scripture, and Experience. I have no idea what scripture my opponent references when he speaks of Purgatory, even in the sense he describes, and request specification. I do know of where he is getting New Jerusalem and the pit of burning sulfur commonly referred to as the Lake of Fire. Both of which are located in Revelation. If any of you have ever read Revelation all the way through it will not take long to realize that its one big vision. And they are many aspects to this vision that make it clear it's not a literal representation of the future, such as women with rainbow hair. Next off, if you're going to bring up places like these as other locations you can be mentioned in the bible, then you will have also bring attention to Abrahams Bussem and the many names translated as Hell that are not used in the same context except for Sheol and Hades. Besides Sheol and Hades these include Geheena (which is this place http://www.flickr.com... ) Tarterous, the pit, and the abyss, and the outer darkness. Any time you read Jesus saying the word Hell you will find it was translated from the term Gehenna, a real place the people of his time new of as a garbage dump that smelled awfull due to the brimstone that was in that valley. Sheol or Hades are terms for all encompassing places for the Good and the Evil that very little is truly known about. Tarterous is used only once and the passage only indicated that demons would go there. Abyss and grave are general references to death all together it would seem from their use. Abrahams Bussem and Outer darkness are only used in Jesus parables, which is much the same as representative analogy. Strait forward teaching on where you go when you die simply isn't in scripture. We really largely on Tradition to establish any thought about this matter. Though I did say I don't solely rely on Scripture it is still important and the only one presented by my opponent is the passage from revelation. You mention Satan being in there for 1000 years show's there is time. You cannot explicitly say this is conclusive of any particular passage of time as that is even more hotly debated by biblical scholars. http://en.wikipedia.org... This link shows the 4 prevailing theories, not all of which include literal interpretations of time. Amillinialism goes fine with no time in hell. And so long as both can be interpreted out of scripture that leaves us to choose based on what makes the most sense in its consistency with the rest of Christianity. You make mention of the hell being thrown into the lake of fire, where the eternal torment awaits. I'm fine with referring to the hell in the resolution as a reference to this Lake of Fire as the discussion deals with after judgment. An Annihilationist would argue the Lake is final oblivion but as the passage you linked to reads this is further evidence against that as (metaphoric or not) Satan is there forever onward. He does not cease to be once thrown in. But do take not the only eternal reference is to Satan, when it makes mention in verse 15 of everyone else being judged who is sent there it makes no mention of their eternal duration there. It simply say's they are sent there. Now if I could draw your attention to the term torment used in the passage, scholars have noted that the Greek word kolasin, rendered punishment, should be rendered chastisement, as reformation is implied in its meaning. http://www.tentmaker.org... Discipline is not something you do for the sake of discipline, it is for a constructive end, but given eternal stay nothing constructive can occur. Also the use of the Greek term for eternity in the new testament is explored by the last source I gave as not meaning infinite unless applied to God, and infinite being. The author states: ""'Duration determined by the subject to which it is applied.' Thus it only expresses the idea of endlessness when connected with what is endless, as God. The word great is an illustrative word. Great applied to a tree, or mountain, or man, denotes different degrees, all finite, but when referring to God, it has the sense of infinite. Infinity does not reside in the word great but it has that meaning when applied to God. It does not impart it to God, it derives it from him. So of aiï¿½nion; applied to Jonah's residence in the fish, it means seventy hours; to the priesthood of Aaron, it signifies several centuries; to the mountains, thousands of years; to the punishments of a merciful God, as long as is necessary to vindicate his law and reform his children; to God himself, eternity. What great is to size, aiï¿½nios is to duration. Human beings live from a few hours to a century; nations from a century to thousands of years; and worlds, for aught we know, from a few to many millions of years, and God is eternal. So that when we see the word applied to a human life it denotes somewhere from a few days to a hundred years; when it is applied to a nation, it denotes anywhere from a century to ten thousand years, more or less, and when to God it means endless. In other words it practically denotes indefinite duration"" So the points I leave you with are 1) Visions should not be taken literally 2) Most of our ideas of the after life are founded in Tradition, as Scripture does not let us know the exact nature of any of it, only ruff ideas from analogies. 3) The greek terms aiï¿½nion and kolasin are not even translated correctly. 4) Applying Reasoning after understanding kolasin as discipline and not torment its only logical to conclude the lake of fires flames has a constructive purpose for you personally if you're in there, as any parent knows discipline is for training your kid to behave better."

S63d14e3c-A25c77858	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	"The Catholic Church actually discouraged their followers from reading the Bible on their own "" a policy that intensified through the Middle Ages and later, with the addition of a prohibition forbidding translation of the Bible into native languages. In 1199, Pope Innocent III condemned the translation of the bible book of Psalms into French.In 1211, By order of Pope Innocent III, Bishop Bertram of Metz organized a crusade against all people reading the Bible in the vernacular, and any such Bibles found were duly burned. So, I am not interested in what the Roman Catholic Council has to say concerning hell. They should rather be explaining why they prevented people from having free access to a personal copy of the bible. Jesus words at Mark 9:42-49 ""And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."" These words should not be taken literally. If it were to be taken literally then Jesus is alluding to self-mutilation.""if thy hand offend thee, cut it off"" ""if thy foot offend thee cut it off"" ""if thy eye offend thee cut it off"" If we were to follow this ""cut it off"" rule we will all be maimed maybe even dead as a result of severe mutilation of our bodies. Further, Mark9:49 says ""For every one shall be salted with fire"". So if this fire is literal then everyone has been condemned to a fiery place of torment. When reading the bible we have to read the whole context not just a verse. In this chapter of Mark 9, Jesus was using hyperbole. He was saying that a person should be willing to give up something as precious as a hand, a foot, or an eye rather than allow it to cause him to stumble into unfaithfulness. Hell is not a place of punishment. its a grave. Ecclesiastes 3:19,20-""for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."" Psalms146:4 ""His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."" Ecclesiastes 9:5,6 ""for the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten so is their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun"" The dead is unconscious. They don't feel pain, envy or love. How can such an unconscious dead body be eternally punished when they can't even feel pain.Where is the logic? Romans6:23 ""For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" The reason why humans die is because we are sinful. Exercising faith in Jesus Christ and dedicating our life to God gives us the hope of eternal life. Using hellfire as a scare mechanism to prevent people from sinning is wrong. To err is human. We are all sinful. We sin everyday. No one is perfect. That is the reason why Jesus came to earth to die for our sins. 1John1:8,9-""If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" Exekiel33:11-""Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"" A loving God will never punish people in a fiery place of torment. We inherited sin from Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve the original sinners were sentenced to death not a fiery hell.Genesis3:3-""But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."" Why should their offspring be sentenced to fiery place of torment when they did not commit the original sin.Jesus didn't die for Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are condemned to death. They have been completely annihilated. Jesus died for the offspring of Adam and Eve."	PRO	186

The people who wrote the definitions in the back of Cons bible are not the same people who wrote the bible. If you visit any of my sources, you will see written by the definition is (Christian Religious Writings / Bible) meaning the definitions are backed up by the bible. If Con remains unconvinced that my definitions are reliable, then I will go on and show scriptures that support their definition. Since our first two definitions are virtually the same, I shall only dispute Gehenna and Hell. Gehenna Gehenna is given three characteristics 1)It is an unquenchable and eternal fire. Mark 9:43-44 2)It is a place of torment: Mark 9:45, James 3:6, Revelation 20:10 3)The wicked souls would be cast into it. Mark 9:45, Revelation 20:15 As you can see, while Gehenna may have been a burial site outside Jerusalem, it must also be a place of eternal punishment. It makes no sense why the above three characteristics of Gehenna/Hell would apply to a physical grave site. Side note: If you look up these scriptures, you will find Hell in place of Gehenna. This is because Gehenna is a Greek word used in the original untranslated version of the Bible. When people started to translate the bible into various languages, Gehenna was replaced with Hell. Gehenna=The Hell of torment=Lake of fire Hell Since Hell is just a word that replaces Gehenna, then it safe to assume that Hell is 1)A place of torture with a unquenchable and eternal fire as described above. 2)An abode of the dead where the dead are conscious of nothing. Again, Hell is a word that replaces the Hebrew word, Sheol. This is backed up by all of my opponents original arguments describing a pit filled with the dead that are not conscious. If you want scriptures, then I encourage you to look at his argument in round 1. It is clear now that Hell has two meanings in the bible. Christian translators simply replaced both the Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word Gehenna with Hell instead of coming up with two separate words. Side note- My opponent thinks I am using another source instead of the bible when I talk about NRSV. To clear up confusion, NRSV= New Revised Standard Version Bible. Hell thrown into Hell? Going back to my earlier defense of my definitions, you can see that Hell has two meanings- Sheol and Gehenna. After all the dead have been judged, Sheol(the first hell) will be thrown into Gehenna(the second hell). As it is, if Con doesn't accept my explanation, then he creates a paradox in Revelation 20:11-15. Since he was unable to provide an alternate explanation, then my explanation that has been shown to be valid still stands. Jesus, no hope of being resurrected? Con claims since the scriptures say there is no hope of resurrection, then Jesus would be in hell eternally and therefore my logic is flawed. 1) I do hope Con isn't claiming God doesn't have the capabilities to resurrect anybody he wants. 2) The scripture is referring to those who have sinned. Jesus went there to redeem mankind of their sinful state so they might have a heavenly hope. Since Jesus was sent down to hell to fulfill a duty for God, then it makes perfect sense that he would be resurrected. Con ignored my alternate explanation, that being that Jesus went to Sheol instead of Gehenna making that argument still a possible explanation. Take your pick, Jesus went to Gehenna to redeem man of their sin or he went to Sheol, either one works with the present argument. Are the dead really conscious of nothing? This is absurd because I have given many scriptures showing that they would be tormented day and night in an eternal fire meaning they must be conscious somehow. I have shown numerous times how the dead being conscious of nothing only applies to the Sheol version of hell, not Gehenna. Again, the dead are conscious of nothing only temporarily until the day of second judgment, when they will be either sent to heaven or hell(Gehenna). If my opponent still remains unconvinced, then he should look up Matthew 13:42 “They will throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”- Matthew 13:42 Let me reverse the question on Con, How does the dead weep and gnash their teeth along with being tormented but be conscious of nothing at all? The only explanation that makes sense is that hell has two meanings. One of temporary death with no consciousness and one with eternal punishment with consciousness. Recap Con claims that my definitions are unreliable and not from the bible. But all my definitions came straight from translations of the bible and are supported by actual scriptures, something Con was unable to do. Con never made a good defense as to why Hell and the Lake of fire are not the same thing. He never made the distinction between the two types of hell and just insisted that I am wrong. Con creates many paradoxes in the bible by refusing to accept my explanation for Hell. When the bible says on one hand the dead are consciousness of nothing and then on the other hand says they will suffer for all eternity, it creates a confusion as to what to believe. I gave my explanation to this paradox, but Con denied it without offering an alternate explanation. Most damaging to Con's case though is his outright refusal to acknowledge my scriptures that show Hell to be a place of torment. Never once did he explain or even talk about these scriptures which were my proof that hell is a place of eternal punishment. Conclusion Hell is a place of eternal punishment. Maybe if the title had been, “Hell is an abode of the dead”, then Con might have had a strong case. As it is, his title was “What most Christians think of hell is not a place of torment”. I have shown this sentence to be false on numerous occasions and therefore have completed my side of the argument.	CON	188
Sd63073be-Aaba71fa0	The Many Worlds Interpretation can resolve the problem of Hell	"Thanks for the topic treyprice. There is empirical possibility and logical possibility. There are other worlds which are LOGICALLY possible, but the only world that actually exists is this one. Since the logically possible world where I accept Christ DOES NOT exist in this world, then I am damned to hell empirically, in real life, according to Christian Doctrine, meaning that God is not omnibelevonent, since he wants me tortured forever (my opponent concedes to this point in Round 1 - that if a person is damned to hell, God cannot be omnibenevolent; don't let him change this advocacy later). In addition, God must be necessarily omnibenevolent, meaning that he is omnibenevolent in ALL POSSIBLE worlds. Otherwise, we could conclude that God is omnipotent, for example, just because it is POSSIBLE for God to be omnipotent in a possible world, even if he is NOT omnipotent in this one. But omnipotence, omniscience, or omnibenevolence all imply necessity - existence in all possible worlds. Even if my opponent is right, God would still not be omnibenevolent in THIS world, which disproves God's existence in this world (since he is defined as omnibenevolent). And because the definition of God is as necessarily existing (Plantingua's ontological argument), meaning existing in all possible worlds, then if God does not exist in this world, he does not exist in any world. So my opponent cannot extrapolate then to other worlds, since God would not exist in those either. To show why this is a horrible approach, it justifies torture. If I said ""tell me who stole the cookie or I'll cut your ears off,"" that creates two possible worlds, one where you tell me who stole my cookie and one where you don't tell me. In this world, you don't tell me and I cut off your ears. But this is not a mean thing to do because there is a possible world where I didn't do this. That doesn't make me any less bad of a person."

Sb471a2b7-A313a19d	It is ethical for God to send people to Hell.	"-A. REBUTTALS- ""You offered nothing that says one most faithfully believe in God."" Con: You're wrong. I clearly state at the beginning of A1, "" In order to go to Heaven from a Christian perspective, one must FAITHFULLY believe in God..."" I guess you missed this, but it is there. ""Furthermore, you have no logical or factual foundation for asserting that a *good deed/bad deed ratio has no affect on one's salvation.*"" Con: Yes I do. One of my sources states *that* explicitly. ""The logic here is that if one were to choose to live a life of sin, it is most likely that one would die a sinner without repent."" Con: I don't see how this is connected. No matter what one has done with their life, I don't think anyone would seriously choose eternal damnation. Besides, this debate is not about what actions WILL send one to Hell, it's about the ethics of God sending people there. I don't think there is any sin or action that qualifies someone for eternal damnation which is why I think it is unethical for God to send people there. ""Why live your entire life in a way in which you do not believe?"" Con: Well, that's exactly what I'm saying. If a Christian who is a bad person makes it into Heaven over an atheist who is a good person, I have a problem with this. I should be able to live my life in any which way I desire - eternal damnation is a completely unreasonable punishment. It's not like the person suffering will learn anything. ""That biblical quote does not prove your argument as there is no indication that life refers specifically to Heaven."" Con: The quote states something along the lines of, "" the strait gate leadth TO life."" If they're not talking about afterlife, what are they talking about? You can try to make a case for something irrelevant but eternal life is being implied. ""Heaven is most often referred to as ""Eternal Life"" in the Holy Bible."" Con: Try quoting a source and I'll consider that point. As for now, it holds no merit. ""Also, I find it hard to believe that you are copying a direct quote, as a strait is a body of water, while continuity without curves or angles is spelled straight."" Con: First of all, I provided the link to the particular source that contains the quote you're referencing. Second of all, English wasn't as developed during the time of the Bible so I don't see how the spelling of straight even matters. ""Christians in China."" Con: China is still predominantly Buddhist and other religions make it up as well [1]. ""It is said that Allah and the Christian God are one in the same."" Con: That doesn't matter. Salvation lies through Jesus and Muslims are doomed if they choose to worship anyone over God. ""This is irrelevant, as although that behavior could be construed as sin, it does not disqualify a soul from entering Heaven en lieu of Hell."" Con: Why not? ""33% of the world is Christian."" Con: Being Christian =/= going to Heaven. Even if I were to accept that all 33% of them are going to Heaven, 77% of the world is still going to Hell. Not acceptable. ""Humanity is full of sin, but that does not meant that God hates humanity."" Con: Probably not, but that's not why I was implying. Still, why would God allow the incident with Adam and Eve? If he hates sin so much, why did he basically let mankind fall to sin? Did he want a reason to send men to Hell? ""It is true that God hates sin, but that is not a qualifier for going to Hell. Rejecting God is."" Con: But at the same time, this isn't about going to Hell. It's about God sending people there. I was going over the criteria to demonstrate how truly unreasonable it is. Furthermore, rejecting God is a sin. Believing in God WILL not save you alone (refer to my first and second link in the first round). ""Although we are going to sin one way or another (since it requires perfection to live an entire life without sin, and we are imperfect), this does not mean that we have a predisposition to sin."" Con: If we're going to sin in one way or another since we are imperfect, then that means we DO have a predisposition for sin. It doesn't mean we prefer or intend to though; you misunderstood. We can't HELP but to sin, we are mere humans. You concede this when you say we are going to sin at some point in some way. Sinning is innate. ""...there is actually an explanation for this: God simply loved us too much to let us go. Repeated again and again throughout the Bible."" Con: I'd consider that an EXCUSE, not an explanation. There was no sufficient reason to allow mankind to fall into something God hated (sin). ""How does one ""correctly conform to Christ""?"" Con: By not FAITHFULLY believing. You provided a definition of this. ""Wtf? Even humanity agrees that condemning serial killers and child molesters is just here on earth. In fact, for many serial killers, we help put them in Hell."" Con: Red herring. What can one learn from eternal damnation? They have nothing to take away from it because it lasts forever. Therefore, it is an unethical and unreasonable punishment. ""If Jewish people don't go to Heaven, [then] Jesus went to Hell."" Con: Oh please. Jesus was the literal son of God and the Bible is testament to Jesus's holiness. ""Although they reject the notion that Christ is God, that is a bit of a gray area. Christ is an avatar, an analogy of God, but He did speak to God while He was here on earth as a man, and He is regarded as God's son rather than God Himself."" Con: Jews do not serve Christ nor do they look at him as a window to salvation. See the source I referenced in that argument. -B. ARGUMENTS- ""That is an illogical simile. It is more akin to your children rejecting you after you dedicate your life to them. You'd want to kill those little bastards, too."" Con: You label my simile illogical and then attempt to refute it with an illogical analogy. There are valid reasons to reject God and even your parents (consider abuse). However, you couldn't ever deny your parent's existence, now could you? After all, they clearly exist. Anyway, how exactly do we harm God by not worshiping him? Anything about Satan or the ugliness of sin won't work because Satan is basically God's subcontractor and sin was something God could've easily prevented. I don't see how you're going to dig a way out of this hole. ""Not allowing someone to live in your home because they do not respect you should thus be considered likewise barbaric."" Con: Non-sequitur. This doesn't making God sending people to Hell anymore ethical, something that you must establish as Pro. ""For God to intervene is for Him to remove free will, so I prefer He does nothing about it."" Con: Do you believe the Bible predicted events? Please answer me in your next rebuttal. ""As far as letting someone suffer -- if the love of your life got a disease from someone with whom she cheated on you, are you going to spend your last dime on helping her live?"" Con: This comparison seems effective but doesn't follow correctly. I suppose disease = sin but we are going to sin even if we believe in God. Also, if disease = Hell... Hell is from God, so again, it doesn't work. Explain. -CONCLUSION- Pro has done nothing to fulfill his burden. He has not shown in even one way why it is ethical for God to send people to Hell. Meanwhile, my points stand."	CON	190
S63727781-A62040ff3	satan fights for god, there is no heaven without hell	"I would disagree. Heaven is described as being a wonderful place, and the Earth is merely a regular one. There can be a heaven without hell, so long as it's better than the Earth. Satan doesn't fight for God. Satan was cast out of heaven because he actually rebelled against God. If the bible is all true (Which I doubt) then that would mean Satan is actually a deceiver, and one that is meant to pull people away from God's teachings. I lack any way of seeing how pulling people from the path of God helps God. Quite frankly, it seems that would do just the opposite. Now, I ask you to find a way to make Satan's active rebellion against God into something that is actually helping God. As for the ""No heaven without hell"" statement, that isn't true. In catholic religion, 3 afterlife locations are described. Heaven, eternal bliss, Limbo, eternal nothingness, and Hell, eternal punishment. Without hell, there is still Limbo. Even without Hell or Limbo, an all powerful deity like God could definitely force you into non-existence or even just not let you into Heaven."	CON	191
S570e9120-Ab7033ed2	Your Existence is Justified By Burning in Hell Forever, if Not By the Blood of Jesus Christ	"Ok, since your questions are loaded with a lot of assumptive rhetoric, I will question your assumptions. Hitler and Ghandi are both gone from us, we cannot ask them how their existence if justied. You are asking me questions that it is impossible for me to answer when you ask where they are or how they could be somewhere other than where they are? How am I supposed to know? for all I know, they both are in heaven. For all i know, they both are in Hell. Maybe one is in Heaven and the other in Hell, or the other iHeaven and the one in Hell. I don't know. One thing I do know is that Ghandi coud not possible gain heaven by any amount of good works. If his good works outwaighed his bad works, why did he have to die like everybody else? It is not possible for your good works to outwaigh your bad works. Your bad works carry more weight, and they have set you apart from God and are pulling you down to Hell where your existence as a sinner is justified. Sin is what we die for, sin is what takes a person to Hell. If sin is not removed from our record, the fire of Hell justifies our continued existence as sinners. As far as I know, Ghandi and Hitler are both in Hell now with no way out because they were both sinners and both died trusting in their own works. But I could be wrong. Maybe they are both in heaven. That is not the subject of this debate. I do know there is only ons Saviour, and there is only one satisfactory payment for Ghandi's sins (and he had sins on his record the same as everybody else, not even Ghandi was perfect). The only Saviour is Jesus Christ. Ghandi's personal beliefs and good things he did are not his Saviour. The only thing that can fully satisfy God as payment for sin is the sinless blood of Jesus Christ which He shed in Ghandi's place. If Ghandi chose to trust in his own beliefs and his own actions however good they may have appeared, Ghandi was trusting in things that could never remove sin from His record and Ghandi's existence is justifed by the fire of Hell burning against him for his sin. There is no need for me to provide references to show that religions are based on what a person does to gain paradise, eternal life, Heaven, Nirvana or the non-existence which is the hope of the atheist. You yourself have already pointed out the presumption that you can be justified by practicing a religion of good works. You illustrate this by your assumption that Ghandi's good works ourweighed his bad works so he earned a ""don't burn in Hell"" certificate. It is not possible to earn a ""don't burn in Hell"" certificate, much less a ""God now owes you entrance into heaven for all the good things you have done"" certificate. The only way your existence can be justfied outside of the fire of Hell is that your sins be completely paid for so you can be pardoned. The only payment God can accept as complete payment is the blood of the One who never deserved to die, but died on behalf of sinners who would believe on Him and receive Him as their Saviour. He is alive, He is God, He is a real person. He is not a religion. He is the Saviour through whom we come to know God personally. Knowing God is reality. Religion is trying to reach God or gain His approval, or things like that which give supposedly credit to your behaviour. It is more than presumptious to assume God will owe you or Ghandi any thing other than the fire of Hell. God cannot be benevolent to sin as sin is malevolent to God. Sin is against God, God is against sin. We are sinners who deserve to die and burn in Hell no matter how much we are like Ghandi or any other esteemed example of trying to be good while being imperfect. God cannot honor religion. God can only honor Himself. He will not honor you with your sin if you think you deserve His honor. Your sin has to be removed from you or you must bear it in the fire of Hell. If your exixtence outside of Hell is not justifed by the blood God gave on the cross when He took your death on Himself before rising from the grave free of sin's penalty, then your existence is justified by the fire of Hell chained to sin's penalty. You ask ""why did God create us""? He created us because He is good. He gave us life because He is good. He created us and all things for His own pleasure and His own purpose, to glorify Himself. If you die in your sins, God is glorifed in justifying your eternal existence by leaving you where sin belongs, in the fire of Hell. If you A) admit you deserve to die and burn in Hell for your sin, B) Believe God to your sins on Himself and paid in full with His holy blood before He rose from the grave to be the justifier of all who believe on Him , and C) Call on God in the name of Jesus Christ who took your death so that you can have His eternal life to save you from Hell, your existence will be justified by the blood of Jesus Christ which paid for you sins and you will have eternal life adn heaven will be your home."

Sa53f9c67-Add4cf878	Hell would be a better fate than Heaven	To start off I would like to make a few things clear. I am an atheist and my interpretation of heaven is coming from any biblical references to it. Since heaven has not been in any current (nor has hell). All evidence will therefore be pulled from the Christian heaven and hell contained in the Holy Bible. My two arguments Hell is designed to induce physical pain by burning. Therefore, since this hell is made to tell the brain that the individual is under much stress. Heaven is designed to be a personal paradise where everything and everyone there is to the individual's favor. To begin, hell is depicted as a horrendous environment. It's sole purpose is to provide a punishment to those who sin. As such, it was intended to take advantage of our brain's natural fear of anything dangerous to our body. Since hell contains fire, demons, and lava in some interpretations, this would go to show that these painful things must be avoided and a person must follow the path of a Christian. The point here is that hell was made to make us miserable. It does this my putting our brain in a state of intense pain by burning. As we know, pain is a system developed to protect our bodies. So a reaction by the brain is to try to escape the source of pain to escape the danger. However if the danger is everywhere, then we'd have nowhere to go. So our brain would constantly be trying to figure out ways to escape this danger in vain. That would mean that in hell, we would hardly be able to think, much less go insane. So it would just a an experience of physical pain that halts all operations in the brain that would be able to make it pleasurable at all. So, it's all bad all the time. Now we move on to what heaven is. It's a place of perfection that is meant as a reward to those who remained faithful and holy. This also takes advantage of the brain's reward system, Dopamine. By getting doing desirable things, your brain makes you feel good by releasing dopamine into your system. Since heaven is intended to be a reward, it would make sense to assume that our we would constantly be experiencing pleasurable moments that would allow our brains to continuously release dopamine. How this is accomplished is determined by the individual's own likes and passions. Since heaven is made to make us feel good and rewarded, and hell is intended to make us feel pain and punished, it would be logical to infer that heaven is the better of the two scenarios. I await your rebuttal.	CON	196

It's extremely important for the viewers to read all or you will be lost and severely mind fucked..... ..................................................................... The word hell in many translations is also refereed originally to as the grave.....or world of the dead. Sheol- means pit....grave or dwelling place f the dead.(in other words hell) 1. First of all to be tormented would mean that you could feel pain or some sort of mental anguish. Eccl. 9:5, 10 -The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all...all that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in sheol, the place for witch you are going. ps. 146:4 - his spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground;in that day his thoughts do perish. ........if we are conscious of nothing then we obviously don't feel pain or anything else for that matter, and since there's obviously no knowledge, that means we wouldn't be capable of knowing pain. Also thoughts perish witch also supports my claim. Job 14;13(job was alive at the time and was considered a very good man by god) Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me? .........this shows that good people go to hell as well it also shows that there is no eternal torture because it doesnt make sense for god to punish a man considered good by god..........also the fact that jesus was in hell.....why would god allow jesus to be tortured or punished hen he was perfect and free of sin? Now we get to the confusing part......separating the lake of fire from hell(the graveyard) Rev. 14:9-11 If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. .....this torture cannot be referring to those that go to hell.....witch are conscious of nothing at all........this lake of fire......and hell are separate. Revelation 21 :8 says clearly that ""the lake witch burneth with fire and brimstone,"" means the second death.......................so clearly the second death and hell,sheol,or haides are entirely different things. i have more information but im going to keep it simple unless my opponent brings up my points.........so obviously what we commonly believe to be hell is not a place of torment"	PRO	199

The Killings of God My opponent must approach this with a realistic amount of choice verses here. I would say that three examples of killings by God with Pros choosing would suffice this argument. B. God endorsed slavery God really never endorsed slavery but simply put rules and regulations on it for Israel.

God is not just, nor does He have a heart My opponent offers us here a quote from the Bible with no book, verse and source. I have never read this verse so I am interested in reading it. Living morally or not is not the ultimate factor to Jesus Christ. The ultimate goal is finding Jesus and asking Him to forgive you. D. What's the point of hell? The point of hell is giving those who do not want to serve God their place without God.

My opponent is entirely correct that on a larger than quantum level there is less and less (if any) randomness because of the law of large numbers. I am at the moment unsure whether or not quantum randomness exists as there are multiple interpretations of quantum mechanics. But, as my opponent hasn't argued for quantum randomness as a source of free will I will be happy to forget all about randomness within the confounds of this debate. So let us continue as if Causal Determinism is real and we shall not speak of randomness again. Law My opponent states that people are responsible for their actions and that we have free will to do what we want, when we want if we chose to do so. My opponent provides no argument for this fundamental assertion but does(!) provide an often heard objection to free will: ""Law"". I actually agree with my opponent on this point. The fact that a law exists is not magical deterrent to act in a certain way. People can and often do break the law and indeed they are thrown in prison for it. In so far I also agree with the fact that a divine law would not rob people of free will. Let us continue with the agreement in mind that law doesn't disprove the existence of free will. Choosing how to respond to situations My opponent states that ""a person might not be able to control events, as people are born into certain circumstances, it IS our choice on how to deal with the situation"" but gives no argument why the choice ""how to deal with a situation"" is different from any other material chain of events that is bound to causality. It is true that a person can chose how to deal with a situation, but what choice that person makes is determined by factors beyond their control (some would say these factors are ""part"" of the very situation). My opponent asks whether our hypothetical murderer took the murder his father committed as ""normal"". The answer to this question is that it depends on factors beyond Brian's control whether or not he took it as normal. The same can be said of any other question my opponent asked. ""Did he learn from his father being imprisoned?"", ""Could he have not chosen better friends?"" etc. The answers to all these questions is ""Brian did what he did because of factors beyond his control."" So in conclusion: people can choose how to react to a situation but that choice depends on prior causes and factors beyond their control. It is not random at all. It is Determined by Causality. Casual Determinism. On souls My opponent states ""Out of our consciousness and awareness to our surroundings, we have the will to react in certain ways."". I agree that we have a certain will to react in certain ways and that some of that will comes from our consciousness and awareness. But we have not chosen what ""will"" we end up with. My opponent answers my question ""Why do some souls murder and others don't?"" with ""people have different morals based on their upbringings, personality, genes, situation etc."" which are all factors that are beyond the control of the soul. So does my opponent agree with the fact that some souls seems to choose murder and others don't because of factors beyond their control? No, because my opponent follows up with ""... and so they choose with their free will to act differently based on their current situation."". If two souls would be in the exact same situation (both have the same upbringings, personality, genes, situation etc.), why would some souls murder and others don't? What causes the one soul to do the one thing and what causes the other soul to do the other thing? My opponent seems to try and answer that with the following statement ""It is not the strength of the soul, but rather the reaction to uncontrollable events in our lives (which are controlled events in other people’s lives, based on their choices and reactions to previous situations) that determines the outcome of an event."" and with the statement ""So, technically, these “factors” of Brian, are really all in his control based on his reaction to his earlier and current experiences."" and the statement ""So, in conclusion, in terms of Brian, he IS accountable for his deeds because of the way he chose to respond to previous events."" In other words he states that it is this souls reaction to other(!) events that determines the outcome of this(!) event. I agree with this, but the reaction to other events is also(!) caused by factors beyond the control of the soul and reactions to other prior events. So it comes down to the first choice of the soul which wasn't(!) influenced by prior choices of this soul (because it is the first) and therefore is only(!) influenced by choices beyond the control of the soul. My opponent states that ""Souls in humans are not necessarily different"", I would like to ask what exactly my opponent means by this. Because if souls are not different from each other that what causes them to choose differently in the exact same situation? Prison vs Hell My opponent frequently compares hell with prison throughout the opening statement and seems to suggest that if I accept the concepts of prisons I should logically also accept the concept of hell. ""So, just as a person... against God’s law."" ""then according to your... this is quite absurd."" ""The law is established... you receive eternal life."" ""By his choices, he... breaking the law here."" I am all for throwing people in jail. But I do not(!) believe people are responsible for their own actions. There are many differences between hell and prison. For example: Prison stops people from doing illegal things that bother people outside of prison. But people only go to hell when they are already dead and therefore can no longer Sin on Earth. Prison sentences are finite. The punishment (hopefully) teaches people not to break the law again and (hopefully) deters them from doing it again when they get out of prison. This mechanism doesn't work with the concept of hell. The treat of sanctions like prison sometimes deters people from acting in a manner we don't want them to act. The treat of hell only stops people that believe in hell and doesn't deter people that don't believe in hell (because of factors beyond their control). In conclusion: It is just to sacrifice the well-being of people that have no control over their actions to protect other people but it is not just to punish people that only act in certain ways because of factors out of their control after death when they are no longer a treat to anybody. But even if hell had some practical means of bettering the world it still didn't mean that people entered it by virtue of having control over their actions. Summary I agree the world is probably not random and we should not discusses randomness as it has no influence on the subject at hand. I agree the law doesn't disprove free will. I have shown souls respond to situations based on factors beyond their control and prior responses. There must have been a ""first response"" to a ""first situation"" that was based entirely on factors beyond the soul's control. Which means all responses of the soul are ultimately based on factors beyond the soul's control. Hell is different from prisons as prisons are practical means to influence the choices still being made. But even if hell and prison where the same it still didn't mean that people entered it trough fault of their own, as people enter prison trough no fault of their own. Which argues for the statement."

S553a1156-A235d9dde	HUMANITY IMMORAL/DESTINED to Hell at BIRTH	It is a undeniable fact that Humanity is an immoral creature. It is This which sets humanity apart from all other creatures, in that Mankind is incapable of Living a moral life at anytime in its lifetime. It is alledged that humanity is moral, this is in error and easily proven false! As defined Morality is the act of being Good/Right. This character trait does not exists on Earth nor ever has to anyone born of Man and Woman. To be truthful, one MUST have never lied!, To be Good one must have never sinned! You simply cannot be moral periodically, you either are or are not! Though not the point of this debate ... it IS this reason Christ was required to pay for the sin debt of Gods creation! It is this reason that prevents Humanity from going to Hell at death. Though the greater part of Humanity itself is and WILL go to Hell, as unrepentant sinners! Just a Fact ... without need for debate! IF you cannot show by more than opinions that Humanity IS MORAL ... don't take the debate because this is a FACT OF LIFE and IS by EVIDENCE undeniable! If you cannot SHOW evidence beyond personal opinions Then all are NOW aware of the TRUTH that Man IS IMMORAL, and that God devulges truths to Christians that normal humans (those destined to Hell) cannot see nor understand unless pointed out by Believers of faith! Rules- Evidence only, not opinions. may begin with evidence as evidence is provided proving immorality of Man! Evidence- To be Truthful requires permanence in truthfulness- impossible for humanity! Evidence- to Be moral requires permanence in moral conduct. Impossible for Man! everyone on Earth has lied, cheated, and broken Human AND Gods moral laws already in their Lifes, this makes all humanity immoral. Humanity continues to violate the moral laws of Man and God throughout Life, remaining immoral. This should end all discussions of Morality as a debate as it is now understood that there IS NO MORALITY upon the Earth.	PRO	202

Why don't we gather all obese people and put them on a remoteness island, where they have to hunt animals, gather food and fight each other to survive? That will force them to get healthy and when all of them are fit, they will be allowed to come back to our society. ""Brilliant idea"", you might say. Now, I am not an expert in this area but if you want to decrease the number of obese people in the US, there are many better ways to accomplish that. One way to deflate the high obesity rates could be setting up institutions where anyone could come and receive free diet- and workout counselling. That is just one of many ideas to make things work. Let's be real, you can't pick out all obese people, and make them do something. This is not some health-holocaust."	CON	204

S91b6b383-Ac859307c	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"Thank you for accepting this debate and taking a unique twist I haven't seen before. Your entire response sounds a little ""rebuttally"" but I will give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were making an argument. It is difficult to see another person's argument and not make a response to it directly throughout your argument. Rebuttal ""Another issue with John 3:16 is that while it guarantees eternal life for those who believe in God, if those who did not believe in God 'perished' and did not have 'eternal life', then how would they be punished for eternity in the first place? Isn't hell supposed to be eternal agony? If you simply have your soul and body perish in hell then that might just be the cure for boredom many sinners had wished to find in life."" These questions do not have anything to do with the topic. The enjoyment somebody experiences in hell doesn't belong in this conversation. This is a logical fallacy known as ""Avoiding the Issue."" I will not answer these questions, but this isn't evidence for your case unless you can provide some reasoning for this logic: P1: Hell isn't eternal agony for sinners who want to be cured of boredom. P2: Aborted babies are sinners who are experiencing boredom. C1: Aborted babies do not go to hell. And of course if you actually do somehow make a coherent argument for this, I would like a P1 and P2 Biblical justification otherwise they are unsubstantiated claims. ""Psalm is someone stating that they thought they were sinful at birth."" Wrong. David said for a fact that he was sinful at birth, sinful from the time his mother conceived him. ""The fact that it states 'mother conceived me' and not 'parents conceived me' and doesn't even point to the father figure implies that this individual thought conception was something other than the formation of a zygote and was not referring to the sexual production of them but rather their 'conception' into this world (which was funnily enough the 'birth' they'd referred to in the previous sentence). Back when the Bible was written people didn't know all that much about how children were conceived, many thought that sex was just something fun to do with your partner and that the marriage itself encouraged a randomized birth rota to commence in the wife. There was literally no understanding of the direct link between sex and birth. Thus, the sexual conception of the child could not possibly have been what this was referring to. He probably was just reiterating what he meant."" People did have a good understanding of what lead to the conception of babies, even in the Bible. Genesis 38:8-9 says ""Then Judah said to Onan, 'Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.' But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother."" A person here masturbated before having sex with somebody who wasn't even his wife because he knew if he didn't he would probably conceive a child. ""If everyone was sinful from the time they were conceived getting into heaven would be impossible and an unfair uphill struggle that would encourage no-one to believe in the religion an everyone to be disgusted at how unfair God is."" Hence why we are having this debate. ""Thus, the correct interpretation of it must be that only from the time you enter the world and actually can remotely act and think are you judged."" Let me outline your logic: P1: God wouldn't do something unfair. P2: Becoming sinful at birth which ultimately leads aborted babies to hell is unfair. C1: God wouldn't send aborted babies to hell. Please give Biblical justification for P1 and P2. Numbers 14:18 says, ""The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation."" This alone shows that god doesn't find punishing children unfair. As it stands right now, your claim is just an assertion. ""Another issue entirely is that there is no such thing as an aborted baby, making this resolution impossible for Pro to uphold. Aborted fetuses going to hell would be another debate entirely. As for the notion that God sends the 'aborted babies' to hell, this is also impossible as the body clearly remains on Earth no matter what."" This is a straw man. You are arguing that the bodies of the babies can be physically seen staying on the earth. I am not arguing that the body itself would go to hell although I could, since the Bible says that those people go to hell. This is also completely off topic, again. God clearly states in the Bible that he sends at least some people to hell (like Galatians 5:19-21). God would probably be talking about their soul or human essence. It is not needed to argue about this though, since the Bible says they go to hell, and rule #4 says that the Bible is 100% truth. Even if the Bible stated that hydrofluoric acid was healthy to drink, we may not argue against that no matter how much science would disprove said statement. If god said Billy Bob was for sure in hell and we just buried him and if we believed that the Bible was 100% true, we would have to assume that either god was talking about some kind of ""soul"" or everything we see is an illusion. What I want you to do is find some passages that give a clear indication that aborted babies don't go to hell. ""If the resolution meant that he sends their souls to hell, it should have specified this as the soul is not the aborted baby as a soul cannot be aborted in the first place since abortion is a purely organic process."" In the rules, I state that the person would go to either heaven or hell, which are mutually exclusive. I also stated that heaven and hell are an afterlife in the rules (indirectly) so they head to heaven/hell directly after they die. We cannot argue against this as stated by the rules. I conclude that the resolution remains unopposed."	PRO	206

S158e26da-Aad9445a7	what we commonly believe to be hell is not place of torment	"I will now rebuttal my opponents case and the go into to the stronger case of this debate being the pro. First we should not be using the Internet to get our definitions, over time translations of the original words have been misconstrued. So we need to use a more reliable source for definitions being the bible.....specifically mines is......the new world translation of the holy scriptures. witch I will be using to define the following terms.....by the way all these can be looked up in the back 0f the bible Sheol-Hebrew word for hell, the graveyard, the pit Hades-Greek word for hell, the grave hell-the pit, the graveyard of the dead Gehenna- is an actual place on earth, the valley of hinnon witch is just outside of the walls of Jerusalem. it was the site of idolaratous worship, child sacrifice etc..... In the first century it was used as an incinerator for ""the filth of Jerusalem"" Bodies of dead animals ere thrown there. No humans were thrown there at least not alive. so obviously Gehenna is not a place of torment and is not even ""commonly believed hell.""....gehenna is something separate.( also the lake of fire has eternal torture witch I will further explain latter, but if a live human was tossed into gehenna they would die within 30 minutes at longest.....so obviously its not eternal torture since you would eventually die in the flames) At Matthew 10:28, Jesus warned his followers to""be in fear of him that can destroy the body and soul in Gehenna."" What does it mean? Notice that there is no mention here of torment in the fires of gehenna. by referring to the ""soul""(witch the soul and persons life is the same thing) separately, Jesus emphasised that god can destroy a persons life prospects. thus there's no hope for ressurection.So Jesus used gehenna as an analogy to symbolize a permanent cut off So please lets stick to my biblical definitions............now onto my opponents case(hopefully I have enough characters to finish....lol) he states; ""All that die now go straight to Sheol as my opponent said, but when the day of second judgment comes, all the wicked will be cast into Gehenna. Gehenna is the lake of fire as used in the bible but is translated as hell in the NRSV."" I don't know what the nrsv is but like I said the bible is the only reliable source of evidence here.....about the day of judgement..... as I have clearly defeated and will further defeat my opponents claim of gehenna and the lake of fire being the same thing. Here's a quote by my opponent “And I saw the dead…..and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things….. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”- Revelations 20:11-15 (I looked these up...and) at rev 20;13-and the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead etc.....( clearly this shows that only those in Hades are dead,) rev 14-15 ""and death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire.....furthermore whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.( it says death and Hades(hell) was hurled into the lake of fire....why would hell be thrown into itself????? the context of the sentence and the facts and logic within this sentence further proves that what we commonly believe to be hell is not a place of torture......but is in fact separate from hell......as it states in the bible it is second death.) another piece of my opponents case.... ""Why did Jesus and Job go to hell? 1)It is commonly accepted that Jesus died for our sins. So in a since, you could say Jesus took our place in hell."" absolutely not this logic is extremely flawed.....since my opponent wants to claim that hell is a eternal fiery place of torment witch is absolutely wrong........why is Jesus resurrected if hell is a eternal place of punishment.if hell is the same as gehenna(and its not) witch as I stated earlier if you go there, there is no hope of resurrection. then how would his soul be retrievable to be resurrected? Now if the viewers and my opponents link everything I've said together I have rebutted my opponents case threw logic, scriptures, and facts. my case stands ineffectively rebutted therefore I should win this debate. For my opponent to win he needs to effectively awnser my questions and contradict the logic of my position. Going back to the stronger case of the debate being pro ""what we commonly believe to be hell is not a place of torment"" 1. First of all to be tormented would mean that you could feel pain or some sort of mental anguish. Eccl. 9:5, 10 -The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all...all that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in sheol, the place for witch you are going. ps. 146:4 - his spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground;in that day his thoughts do perish. ........if we are conscious of nothing then we obviously don't feel pain or anything else for that matter, and since there's obviously no knowledge, that means we wouldn't be capable of knowing pain. Also thoughts perish witch also supports my claim. besides my opponent failing to defeat this he also fails to tackle 2. Job 14;13(job was alive at the time and was considered a very good man by god) Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me? .........this shows that good people go to hell as well it also shows that there is no eternal torture because it doesn't make sense for god to punish a man considered good by god..........also the fact that Jesus was in hell.....why would god allow Jesus to be tortured or punished when he was perfect???"

S3f0e9ff1-A3a95a3b4	God is not real	Here are some reasons why god is not real. There are 12 major religions. There are many factions of each, but there are 12 majors. Each religon has a following that is absolutely certain their religion is the correct true religion. Christers reject 11 major religions as false and absurd. I just reject one more religion than christers. I reject all 12 as false and absurd. Christes are christians because that is what they were taught from childhood. Christers did not become a christian by researching all 12 religions and choosing the christian religion. All christians have been brain washed. The truth is, there are NO supernatural gods of any kind in any religion. There are no devils, no demons no satans. The christian religion has to have a devil to blame when things go wrong. Christians cannot allow any blame to fall on their god. They have to have a devil to blame. Without a devil and a hell, their entire religion collapses. I am going to prove based on rational evidence, that there is no god, there is no devil, there is no hell, there is no heaven. 1. Prayers are never answered when verifiable things are prayed for. Examples: Christians have been praying for at least 50 years for their god to stop abortions, but their god has never stopped even one single abortion. 2. No amputee has ever had a limb picked up off the ground and healed back on. 3. No one with a bleeding open wound has ever been healed. 4. Three billion living and long dead christians have been praying for their god to appear on earth in person for 6,000 years. The bible god has never been seen except in the fictional bible. The bible god is still a no show.....If the bible god existed, he obviously doesn't care anything at all about his silly followers. What could a supernatural god be doing for 6,000 years? A real supernatural all powerful god could do anything with a though alone, yet the bible god can't take even one minute to appear on earth IN PERSON.?!!!!!! 5. Absolute proof your god can not really heal anyone. Gather together christians in the largest church possible. News media notified. Prayer event can be televised live worldwide. Get a christian volunteer to walk on stage as every christian watching commences praying. There is no chance that a real god could miss several 100 million or so praying christians. As prayer continues the christian volunteer has a finger or hand chopped off. The severed limb must be allowed to fall to the floor with camera close ups from all angles to prevent fraud. Meanwhile all christians are still praying enmass, begging their god to pick it up and heal it back on. Praying can continue until the volunteer either bleeds to death or is treated by a DR. The volunteer will NOT be healed. GUARANTEED. Testimonials about this or that christian who had cancer, or someone's heart condition, or any church members cirrhosis of the liver etc etc etc, who were healed through prayer are just worthless testimonials. None of that was visible. If It can't be seen it can't be proven. Testifying is meaningless. Proof must be visible to one and all.. Blind faith is meaningless and useless. There are two kinds of faith, demonstrated faith such as faith that your car will start because it always has, and blind faith such as belief in witches or goblins. 6. Christians claim they have a loving god, yet according to their own bible, their god slaughtered all the first born babies in Egypy one night, then slaughtered all the fist born animals too for good measure. 7. Also according to the bible the bible god slaughtered the entire population of the planet including all children, all babies, even all plants and animals. This is a god to worship? 8. Christians blame free will for bad things that happen, but free will is is a false premise. Heres why: Chirstians claim thier god is all powerful and all knowing. If thats true the bible god knows in advance what all 6. 7 billion people on the planet will do....... before they do it. No one has the option to change that which their god knows IN ADVANCE.... (Remember god is ALL KNOWING) that they will do. If god is NOT all knowing then he has to sit back and wonder what each person will do next. In that case, god cannot be all knowing. So either the bible god knows in advance what each of us will do, or he cannot be all knowing. 9. Christians claim they have a superenatural god but the only way to prove that is to ahve their god appear in person. 10. It is imcumbent on christians to actually prove this claim. I can claim that god Vishnew created everything. My claim has the same credibility as yours......... Exactly zero ......unless one of us can actually produce our god in person. Neither one of us can do that because all gods are make believe. All are imaginary. Christers only hae a make believe god.	PRO	210
S91b6b3a2-A9321f7fd	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"Thank you for coming to tonight's debate. The burden of proof We have a peculiar situation in the way this debate is set up. On the one hand, Rule #3 states that the burden of proof is on Pro. On the other hand, round 2 is for opening statements, and I'm not suppose to offer a rebuttal of Pro's opening until round 3. That leaves me with nothing to do in this round. If I don't have the burden of proof, there's no opening statement for me to make. I'm going to go ahead and make an argument negating the resolution anyway. If it happens that my argument fails, it shouldn't matter since I don't have the burden of proof. But if it happens that my argument succeeds, then that should count against Pro's position since it negates his position. Either way, I can't lose by making an argument in this round, so why not? My central argument for the negation of the resolution Here is my argument: 1. If aborted babies are without sin, then the Christian God does not send aborted babies to hell. 2. Aborted babies are without sin. 3. Therefore, the Christian God does not send aborted babies to hell. Defense of the first premise I suspect Pro will agree with my first premise, but just in case he doesn't, let me give a few reasons for why we should think it's true. 1.1 In Matthew 5:30, it says, ""And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell."" The implication is that one can avoid hell by avoiding sin, so one should get rid of whatever it is that's causing them to sin. 1.2 The purpose of hell is to punish people for their sins. In 2 Peter 2:4, 9-10, it says, ""For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment. . .then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority."" So just as God sends the angels to hell for their sins, so also does God send people to hell for their sins. Since the purpose of hell is to punish people for their sins, it follows that if somebody doesn't sin, they won't go to hell. 1.3 In Proverbs 17:15, it says, ""Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent--the Lord detests them both."" If God detests condemning the innocent, and if the unborn are innocent, then God will not condemn them. Defense of the second premise I'm pretty sure Pro will object to my second premise on the basis that David claimed to be sinful from his mother's womb (Psalm 51:5). To that, I have a few responses: 2.1 David's claim can be taken as hyperbole. He means to emphasize the depth of his depravity. In American culture, when somebody is really proficient at something, like playing the banjo for example, we sometimes say things like, ""He was born with a banjo in his hands."" But we don't mean that literally. We just mean they're really good at it. The same thing is true of David. When he says he is sinful from his mother's womb, he just means he's an awful sinner. 2.2 Psalm 51:5 says that David was sinful from the time his mother conceived him. It's impossible for that to be literally true because sin requires the faculty of volition, and volition requires mental states such as intention, desire, and the ability to act. A cluster of cells is completely incapable of having any cognition whatsoever, and it is also incapable of making any choices or taking any action. So it is impossible for David to have literally been sinful from the moment of his conception. 2.3 The whole of Ezekiel 18 argues against children sharing in the guilt of the sins of their parents. So not only do the unborn have no sin of their own, but neither do they bear the sins of their parents. 2.4 In Isaiah 7, there's a prophecy about the birth of Immanuel. In verses 15-16 it says that Immanuel ""will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste."" This passage shows that people are not born with the ability to act morally (i.e. to choose between right and wrong). Rather, it's something they acquire some time after birth. It follows that the unborn lack this capacity and are therefore incapable of sin. 2.5 Nobody can be morally accountable for what they don't know. Jesus said, ""If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains"" (John 9:41). He also said, ""If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin"" (John 15:22). James writes, ""If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them"" (James 4:17). Notice the condition James places on sinning. Before one can sin, they must first know the good they ought to do. But the unborn know nothing at all. From the moment of conception, they don't even have brains. The brain developes some time later. So it's impossible for the unborn to know right from wrong, which means it's impossible for them to be guilty of sin. Conclusion That's it for my case against the resolution. In the next round, I will rebut Pro's case for the resolution. But please keep in mind that I didn't have to make this case, so if Pro manages to refute everything I said in this post, it should not count against me. However, if he wants to refute either of the premises, then he has to refute every argument I gave for that premise. I gave five arguments in favor of the second premise. If he were to refute four of them and fail to refute the fifth, the second premise will be unrefuted. So he must refute all of the arguments."	CON	211
S781de01a-Ae4ac8b90	"""People enter hell trough no fault of their own"" is true."	Opening I would just like to start off by saying that you too are intelligent and seem to know what you are talking about. I can tell you are way more intelligent than I in logic, but I still hope I can bring about an interesting debate on the topic. I apologize if my argument seems to have shifted, it's just the way I have worded everything has changed with new developments. Causation…? So, keeping in mind Causal Determinism and the fact that law doesn’t disprove the existence of free will, let’s start with responding to situations. I would have to say that, you are correct. There are factors out of our control in situations, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t in the hands of other individuals. Now, on a deeper note, where do thoughts come from? Why do we have them? Why do we feel the need for justice? If we think thoughts, where do they come from? Now, I realize there are two sides to the question I am about to ask, I acknowledge that fact. Is it possible our thoughts are supernaturally affected? In the sense that there are forces of “good and evil” that affect our thoughts. What is the cause of such thoughts? My opponent would say that “it is beyond our control”. So whose control is it in? What person or things or forces, supernatural or natural, is behind our thoughts? The thing that makes up our opinions, the thing that makes up everything we are and what we do. What is the source of our thoughts? If it is not natural, what is it? Neurons fire in our brain, but why does that result in what we think? If “something can’t come from nothing”, where do they come from? The Condition of Souls vs. Having two Souls First, when has there ever been two souls in the exact same situation? To have two souls in the exact same situation, you would have to have the exact same person, since the only person who had the exact same upbringings, personality, genes, situation, etc. is you. So, the result would be the exact same, since the people think exactly the same, and on wouldn’t do something the other would since they are the same person, same soul. I mean by that statement that the “soul” humans have is no different than anyone else really, we all see what we see through our eyes, feel with our skin, breath with our lungs, how we live is no different. The soul is no different in that regard, in which having a soul would be the same in anyone, but this does NOT mean the condition of the soul is different. For example, as the body is hurt by smoking, those conditions are impacted on the soul as well. I believe that people’s perspectives on a soul are different, as no one has seen one, but that means nothing, since we can’t see the wind or feel or see space (like, empty space, you only see what’s behind it), and my personal belief of our soul is a “double” of us living inside, that records everything we do, say, and think, for later examination. When we die, our body will decompose and return to dust, but our soul will face judgment for what is found on and in it. People have different opinions on such a matter, but that is my personal belief. And again, I do not see a physical situation where such a matter would happen. Provide me a situation, but be wary because two souls are the same in one regard, but you will never find two people with the same condition of the soul. Why? No two people with different conditions of the soul will respond to every previous event (not everyone goes through the same events) the exact same, as the condition of our soul is ours and ours alone, since no situation can reach a point of 100% resemblance to even test such a theory due to the progression of time (New technologies, outdated ones, etc.) Which, like fingerprints, will never theoretically produce an exact copy, because if it did, theoretically they would react the exact same because if the souls had the EXACT same condition, they would react the same since they think exactly alike. Finally, the Prison vs. Hell controversy. I frequently compare Hell and Prison because I think of them as kind of similar places. For example, their purposes are to keep the transgressors away from those who abide by the law. This is where the condition of the soul comes in. John 14:23 (NIV),”Jesus replied,’If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him.” Why do I quote this? There are countless conditions of the soul, but they fall under two categories in the end, they love Jesus or they do not. I’m not trying to get theological, but when talking about Hell, I believe there is need of a bit of the Bible since that is where we get the Christian “depiction” (if you will) of Hell. While the purpose of Hell is nearly the same as prison, Hell exists as a punishment for transgression, not as a correctional facility. Why? Because the time on Earth was given to the people so they have a choice on how they are going to live. “Outside Factors” you may say come into play, but in the end, it comes down to whoever chooses to listen and repent of “sin” (meaning changing from actions the Christian God finds detestable [side note: God never said he hates anyone, but he does say he hates the ways of people. Again, he doesn’t hate the people, he hates their sin] and listening to the ways of Jesus, as in John 14:23). While prison is not 100% effective in dealing their punishment, as sometimes guards can be bribed for better treatment, people escape, and people serve their sentence yet do not change, meaning that the transgressors get back among and mingle amongst the law abiders. This is where the eternal punishment kind of makes a little sense, since people got the chance on Earth but chose not to listen (which choosing to listen is 100% a choice of ours, regardless of upbringing and such, the choice of listening is ours.), but since they did not listen, they are kept away in the darkness they chose to flee to, away from those who did listen. Hell has a 100% effectiveness rate since none can escape and none can have a termination of their sentence, meaning that for the rest of eternity, those deemed righteous by the blood of Jesus in God’s judgement (sinners who accepted and lived out Jesus’ words) will be kept forever separate in “paradise” as it is described from those who transgressed the law and did not listen, without sentence termination, forever separating those who fled to purity from those who fled to transgression. Meaning: In our prison system today, while some do change, many are released from their sentence and are allowed to mingle among the law abiding people, causing chaos and trouble. In conclusion, All it takes to avoid Hell is listening then living. Regardless of how we act, if we do not listen, there will be no learning from actions and mistakes. Listening is our choice, it is not something that comes and goes or an event that people do not have any control over the factors. In a way, you could say the only way to Hell is not listening, and listening is the only way to heaven (at least, in the Christian Religion. Listening also means believing what the Bible says, hence, why it is often called “God’s Word” among Christians. Not only because that is what we believe God to have spoken through people, but those are the words we must listen to.). Summary- I agree not every interaction is not necessarily in our control, but it is in someones. For example, what is the cause of our thoughts? (see about the brain in the section). The Condition of the Soul is what determines entrance into heaven or hell, as if (in my belief of the “state” of the soul), which the evidence of such condition would only be found in the actions of someone. The things leading to such actions would be a result of refusing to or listening to [the truth] (as Christians think/know/believe it to be). The action of listening is a controllable action, so regardless of other actions, it comes down to one of the few controlled things. (apologies again for any mishaps).	CON	212
Sb471a2b7-A2c8b7009	It is ethical for God to send people to Hell.	"-A. REBUTTALS- ""You didn't approach my rebuttal to that argument, thus, it cannot be considered a veritable argument to defend your claim."" Con: Your whole argument was based off the claim that I didn't say faithfully. If I wouldn't have said faithfully, it would have allowed your last minute salvation argument. Unfortunately, I did say faithfully which disables it. Repenting during your dying moments doesn't count as ""believing faithfully."" Furthermore, what about a man killed in a car crash who was an atheist who never got his chance to know God? Car accidents are abrupt and unpredictable so it's not like the victims ever had their last minute chance to repent. You say humans choose to go to Hell but this goes against all my notions. No one would choose eternal damnation and this should be abundantly clear. I doubt any atheist, Buddhist, Deist, Hindu, etc. would want to be sentenced to Hell. This last minute argument cannot be applied and fails. As for the good/bad deed ratio... ""The Bible teaches that even your righteous acts are like filthy rags to God. It does not matter how many good deeds that you do, YOU STILL CANNOT GO TO HEAVEN BASED ON YOUR DEEDS. The Bible teaches that your good deeds do not commend you to God in any way. You've ignored him choosing to live life the way YOU see fit,"" (See RD1, S1). This indicates that your deeds do not matter, it's your faith and devotion to Christ that do. ""Consider the story of Faust."" Con: Make into an argument and I might. ""Ethics have nothing to do with personal opinion, but what is generally regarded as right or wrong in a construct."" Con: I guess sending people to suffer for all eternity is okay then. I'm being sarcastic but I'm pretty sure consensus would say that eternal damnation is wrong. ""Since the construct that we're referring to is technically God's, you cannot posit an argument about ethics that contradicts God."" Con: You're basically saying that since God owns the world, we don't have a say in whether or not his acts are right or wrong. By your logic, that means the slave owners that owned slaves in the U.S. were completely justified in whatever they chose to do to slaves because they had the power. Besides, we know people suffering is (usually) wrong. However, it is my assertion that it is always wrong when it is eternal suffering because there is no good reason to eternally punish someone. They will not be able to learn anything or take anything away from it which makes it a completely unethical punishment. Any criteria which sends one TO Hell doesn't matter at this point because their is no offense that can ETHICALLY send souls to Hell in the first place. This is part of Pro's burden, keep that in mind, voters. Also, God has no adequate reason to send people to Hell. Is he afraid people are going to overthrow him? I mean, an omniscient being would see this coming and since he is omnipotent, he'd also be able to stop it. ""Furthermore, sending people to Hell is not a standard of conduct -- it is a personal decision by God within His own domain."" Con: This is just a variant of the slave example I gave. Pro says that ethics are right and wrong, not subject to personal opinion, but goes on to say that since it's God's personal decision, ethics don't really matter. Obviously, this debate IS going to center around ethics so quit trying to dodge it. Using Pro's own example, killing someone is (generally) wrong. However, Pro brings up the point of killing a trespasser. First of all, is he comparing humans to trespassers on Earth? Since God supposedly put us here, that doesn't make sense. Second of all, wouldn't warning them be a nicer way rather than killing them? If you shot first without any warning to the unsuspecting trespasser, you could be killing a perfectly good person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. This relates back to my car accident argument - conditions OUTSIDE of one's control shouldn't factor into salvation. Besides, in Pro's trespassing scenario, the man with the gun is obviously supposed to be God and I hardly consider shooting someone as soon as you see them step foot in your yard as ""merciful."" Personal decisions can still be judged by ethics. ""Especially, given He gives us the opportunity to avoid it."" Con: Then I guess you'd support the man with a gun in this following scenario. A man holds another man at gun point and tells him he is going to kill him at the count of three. He says to the unarmed man that if he moves out of the way, he will probably live as the bullet will miss. As the gunman says three, the man can't get out of the way in time and dies from getting shot. I'm not playing with Pro's arguments - I'm simply rewriting them in a more pragmatic way to show voters how they aren't valid. ""Nowhere in the Bible does it state that one must faithfully believe."" Con: Fair enough, but God, given his omniscient state, will know whether you truly believe and are devoted to him. He will also know if you really feel bad for what you've done. If people could just fake faith, repent and loving God, don't you think getting into Heaven would be way easier? Also, faith and believe come from two very similar Greek root words and English doesn't do the original meanings justice [1]. See my source to understand what I'm implying if you're confused. I understand this delves into semantic territory but even in their current usage, faith and believe are pretty similar and go hand in hand. If you believe in something, you have faith in it. ""The ethics of punishment is not predicated on its ability to reform the transgressor. Indeed, some are beyond reform, and others don't want it."" Con: I have two refutations for this which are connected. Part of the purpose of punishment is indeed reform [2]. Ethics come into play when weighing the severity of offense on an ethical scale and using this to match it with an appropriate punishment. With that said, I will repeat my key point that eternal damnation is unjust because it offers no chance of reform and the ""criminals"" pose no threat because God is omnipotent. Pro has tried to sidestep this argument while offering no ethical reasoning within his arguments for Hell. Although the Bible states oppositely, there are far worse things than not believing in God, worshiping another deity or not repenting. One can get life in prison for premeditated murder. A life sentence is just on Earth because according to my purpose of punishment source, part of the punishment is to keep the offender from committing more crime. An omnipotent being wouldn't have to worry about this so Hell is even more unethical. It is completely gratuitous suffering. ""That's irrelevant."" Con: Actually, Christianity is based off of the resurrection of Christ so my point stands. You can't go to Hell for not believing in Jesus when you ARE Jesus. ""Jews for Jesus."" Con: Completely irrelevant. My usage of Jew was as an example of someone who worships the same God without devotion to Christ. ""I said nothing about *harming* God -- but, He is a jealous God, which means that He feels emotion. Thus, he can conceivably feel *EMOTIONAL PAIN* if He loves us and we reject Him."" Con: My point proven. Sending someone to eternally suffer because you are jealous of their devotion to a false deity is blatantly wrong anyhow. ""Thus, free will is essentially the ability to sin."" Con: See gunman argument about sin. ""Analogy."" Con: You wouldn't punish a lover for having sex with a person who wasn't really there (essentially masturbation), meaning God has no reason to be mad at people who worship other gods. At the end of RD1, Pro states ethics are subjective but in RD2 states, ""Ethics have nothing to do with personal opinion."" Can't be both."	CON	213
Sa2c55eda-A7fea99f1	God is not real	Yes but what if we are wrong, what if we have been wrong this whole time. Maybe not everything has to have been created. And the universe is everything, so logically without the universe the universe couldn't have been created. The universe could have been here all along and maybe it didn't have to be created. We haven't found out everything and all we know is a very small amount. What if really far away in space everything is different, different than the world we know. It may show us some evidence of planets being created and new dimensions. Scientific based theories that have had years of research done and evidence of evolution is much more reliable than just thinking that a floating spirit with magical powers went bam! and the world was made. The world has shown us evidence that it Has been around for much longer then 10 thousand years. With the power of science and logic I don't understand how people can still believe in something like God. I mean the only little bit of proof is the bible. But there is no proof that the bible is real. See there is always a loophole for us atheists to disprove God. I am not saying that I know there is no God but I am saying that I am not going to turn away from evidence and logic because there is a chance that God is real. There is no point wasting my life and trying to please God in everything that I do if there is no certainty of his existence. And I would like to ask some personal reflect questions or maybe answer them in your next argument. Why does God kill innocent people for no reason? How does God know the future if we have free will? Why is Gods plan for some people death at birth? How come God sounds so loving and fair when he approves slavery, doesn't think woman are important and kills people that are naturally attracted to the same sex? How could you make this type of God your leader? And if I do not believe in God because my parents have never taught it to me(they have) do I have to spend all of eternity in Hell?	PRO	214
S44f94de9-Aab0d45d0	Medical Boards is the gates of hell	"Well ms. irelandflangan, I would like to say that was a good job and argument for con but, I did extensive research to find a defintion of what ""hell"" is. http://dictionary.die.net... A place where outcast persons or things are gathered; as: (a) A dungeon or prison; also, in certain running games, a place to which those who are caught are carried for detention. I would like to begin how with the first defintion. A dungeon or a prision, Well, so i would like to show you the simalarities bewteen our work space and the defintion of ""hell"". 1.) Our cubicals are appoxmently a quarter of the size of a jail cell, and our work space is very simalar to solitary confinement in a prison. We have no windows, you have your food brought too you and agian no contact with anything outside the four walls of our firey pit of molten lava office. So, as you can see are office is quite similar to a prison or a dungeon. I would also like to point out it is the office where outcasts go. My organzation put me here as a punishment for not completing a successful buisness trip, they stick another buisness man with an immune mutation because his buisness doesn't want him around anyone else, then we take the person in the front...well lets just say she is a product of years and years of living in a cave i like to call Minneasota...and honestly who wants work with someone who can't say 'BAG' right? Once again pointing out that this is where outcasts go. And how dare you insult me by calling me a closet democrat...First off i am not even close to a democrat, secondly look at the argument you posted...sounds mighty like, nasty communist scum I debating. You say we are overlooked for awards, accolodes and gradidtude. Sounds much like a job desription of the USSR. No promotion, no benfit to get work done no recongination.

S5ba5941b-Aacb99f0	Presupposing Islam is true, an eternal hell is justified.	"C1: Status and Morality It seems to me, in fact, that Pro's contention is radically counter-intuitive despite Pro's protestations otherwise. C1.1) I'm not sure by whom it would be considered ""much more immoral to harm or kill a highly respected member of society rather than the common man"" but I would consider someone who held such a moral principle to be, in the best of lights, a deep moral confusion. It might be more disastrous (for American society) if the President of the United States is murdered than if I were murdered, but it's unclear how it'd be more immoral (assuming we were murdered under similar contexts). In fact, if the moral principle that everyone has equal moral worth is true than Pro's contention is just false, full stop. The president is no more instrinsically morally valuable than I or the poor child in Africa. C1.2) Besides the fact Pro's contentions here stem from an archaic model of crime based on fuedal relationships- where the seriousness fo the crime is deterimined by both the act and the social status of both the perpetrator and the victim - that are no longer held to, this threatens to destroy a central intuition motivating retributivism which the theory of punishment assumed by Pro. [1] The intuition is this: the seriousness of the crime determines the seriousness of the punishment. It'd obviously be unjust if I decided that I was going to kill my nephew because he stole some candy as ""punishment"". So, if all sin against Allah merits an infinite punishment what is entailed by that statement is that stealing candy and murdering 26 people both merit an eternity in hell as both are a sin against Allah. This runs counter to the main intution motivating retributivism, i.e. it is radically counter-intuitive. C1.3) It's not even clear why one should accept the proposed claim ""since the more serious a crime is the more serious its punishment should be, all sin against Allah merits an infinite punishment."" in the first place! As Pro somewhat alludes to the nature of the offense also figures heavily into the moral calculations. Say I have 100 ""units"" of moral status and worth. Imagine Pro comes along and just punches me in the face for no discernible reason. Then imagine someone else comes up to me and roughly shoulders me to the side. Clearly Pro here is the one more seriously encroached on my moral status and worth. Both of these acts can't be worth a full 100 ""units' Of moral dishonor and demerit. C2: Consequences of Sin and C3: Free Will There are 3 major issues here - here I will largely just be modifying slightly what I've said in earlier debates on similar subjects from both respective round 3's. C 3.1 actually touches on C2 as well so it can be considered a response to both. C2.1/3.1) As Marilyn McCord Adams has aptly pointed out it'd be entirely irrational, unreasonable, and unethical for Allah to trust such psychologically limited, ignorant, and deception-prone creatures such as ourselves to make decisions regarding our eternal fate - especially since the consequences are so horrible in the case of hell! [2] In short, we have ""diminished capacities"". [3] What this means is that we literally don't have the coginitive faculties capable of truly recognizing how truly terrible eternal punishment; if that is the case (and it surely is) then our moral culpability for ""choosing"" to go to hell is severly diminished. To think that Allah created us with all these setbacks to the clear thinking we need in order to avoid hell and then expect the majority of us not to go hell borders on almost unbelievable. We are in a state in which we cannot discern of the relevant distinctiosn between an act and it's consequences. [4] It'd be like parents putting their two year old in a room with perfectly safe, breathable gas but the gas will ignite if a flame is started in the room. Now,imagine further, the parents have also put in the room gaudy (kid-attractive) colors as a ""test"" to see if their child will obey them. Even if the parent tells their child not to touch the matches and light them and the child knows to obey their parent the parents are still at fault for putting their child in a situation like that in the first place. We wouldnt seriously blame the two year old for ""freely choosing"" to disobey their parent. We wouldn't even adequately conceive a ""direct choice"" for hell, much less an ""indirect choice"" in favor of hell. C3.2) Even supposing that the foregoing point is wrong, the very notion of choosing to ""freely reject"" Allah is nonsense and lapses into incoherency. Talbott asks us to imagine a normal boy who, inexplicably and randomly, thrusts his hand into a fire while screaming in pain. Nonetheless, he does it even though he has strong motive not to do it and the absence of any motive to do it. Could we coherently say this boy had made a free choice to stick his hand into the fire or that he could be held morally responsible for his actions? It doesn't seem so. So, as we can see a minimal degree of rationality is required for an agent to make a free choice. But, then, we have to ask ourselves what kind of rational person would choose to be separated from God and suffer eternal torment? Remember, on Islam, Allah is the source of all goodness and happiness and fundamentally wants what's in our best interests and he wants what we would want for ourselves and others if we were thinking clearly. What rational person would ""freely choose"" to actively subvert what's in their best interests? This raises a dilemma. Perhaps, Pro can allude to something like C.S. Lewis when he writes about those in hell trapped on the inside - those caught in self-delusion (and/or ignorance/misunderstandings); perhaps that sort of person would ""freely choose"" to reject Allah. But then they wouldn't really be rejecting the real and true Allah, now would they? They'd be rejecting a Allah of their own construction and delusions - an infantile caricature of Allah. Perhaps they are like those misinformed souls today who believe that Islam is best represented by those of Bin Laden's ilk. One could hardly say they are ""freely choosing"" to reject Allah on that horn. But, on the other hand, if the person is removed of all delusions, ignorance, and misunderstandings about Allah they'd immediately recognize that it'd be positively absurd to ""freely choose"" to reject Allah. On either hand, the notion of ""freely choosing"" to reject God is simply incoherent. [5] C3.3) Why is free will supposedly so sacrosanct wherein it is elevated to something so absolutely inviolable by Allah? Why could Allah not simply just override a persons' choices at least some of the time...? Remember, hell is an irreparable harm and anyone who had an adequate conception of hell would not want to go there. So the only the way they could choose to go there is only through irrationally choosing to go there (and so it wouldn't be a free choice; more like a random event). If I were to irrationally (maybe due to a mental illness) choose to jump off a 20 story buidling without a parachute for no particular reason I would hope someone I know would stop me and my 'free will' be damned. I would not want them to sit back and say, ""Oh, well, you know, that's his choice and I'm going to respect that. Even though in a sane and rational state of mind he would never choose to do that and he has no reason to do it now, I'm going to just sit back and watch it play out."" Would, Allah who is said be good and merciful, just sit back and watch as his creatures freely choose to do irreparable harms to themselves? Why is the value of free will so elevated in the face of unrelenting torment? [6] Sources [1] http://www.jstor.org...; [2] http://www.debate.org...

Se409bef7-Af74c52ac	You deserve to burn in hell; the same as me.	"You and I have both sinned against our Creator. We are violators of His law. In His eyes, we both deserve to be cast away into fire of hell forever since we have rebelled against the One who created us. We both deserve to die, and we both deserve to burn in hell. Your punishment is not up to you or me. God decides. If our punishment was up to us, we would take time out or a fine and not have to suffer through the death penalty. Can you blame God if He made you to be like Himself in perfect harmony with Him and by your own choice you are more like a devil, arguing against your Creator's right to cast you away like garbage to be burned in fire of hell? He could annihilate you and make it as if you had never existed, but that would imply that what He created was a mistake. The mistake is ours, not His. We have done the wrongs against Him, He has not done wrong against us. He has the right to cast us away from Himself forever into the fire of hell, and we deserve it. Mr Hematite asked: ""You're honestly telling me that an omniscient and omnipotent entity has to fear ""rebellion""? No sir, I did not say this at all. Perhaps you honestly misuderstood what I said, but I never said God has to fear rebellion. If He feared rebellion, He would not have given you freedom of choice. He could have made you as only an animal which could live only by instinct, but He made you to be like Himself for His own pleasure, for His own enjoyment. He deserves honor from us who He created. We dishonor Him by our rebellion, and we deserve to burn in hell. He loves you so much, He took on a body Himself and died in your place. Only His own death is enough to satisfy your debt to Him for dishonoring Him. He had no sin of His own to die for, He died for your sins and rose from the grave to justify all who receive Him by faith as their Saviour, and He will be the Judge of all who disregard the price He paid to save them from the fire of Hell."

Sc9cae544-A39229690	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"NOTE: SperoAmicus and I were engaged in this debate earlier, but due to a delay in my argument posting and poor timing with Christmas, Spero was unable to respond in the allotted time and forfeited. But, since the discussion was very interesting we agree to copy and paste our arguments abck into this debate and continue where we left off. This will be my third go at arguing a problem of evil variant. In my past two debates (and in their comments sections) a theme seems to emerge – people disagree that more or less with the premise that there is evil in the world. There have been many different ways of doing this; you can (correctly) point out that I don't define evil, or say that evil is just an ""absence of God"" or whatever. While these arguments are useful and necessary to establish the problem, I grow tired of them, so I hope that this argument will sidestep that criticism and allow us to move on to something else. Here's the argument: if God exists, no one would go to Hell. I want to start out my mentioning that I will use Hell a lot here, but if you don't believe in Hell, the argument still applies if you substitute ""non-Heaven"", meaning just that God is incompatible with people going anywhere but Heaven. This avoids the questions about evil because by definition, heaven is good and Hell is bad. If you deny this premise, I cannot see a reason to be religious. Religions all seem to prescribe ways to get into Heaven, so if you don't agree that heaven is better than Hell, then there is no reason to try to get into Heaven. My argument formalized is this: 1. If God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. 2. If God is omnipotent, then God has the power to send everyone to Heaven. 3. If God is omniscient, then God knows how to send everyone to Heaven. 4. If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to send everyone to Heaven. 5. According to religions, everyone does not go to Heaven 6. If Hell exists and God exists, then either God doesn't have the power to send everyone to Heaven, or doesn't know how to send everyone to Heaven, or doesn't have the desire to send everyone to Heaven. 7. Therefore, either God, Heaven, or both do not exist. I think that's enough to get us started. I look forward to it!"	PRO	218
Sf4081bc4-A416b7464	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	First of all I would like to point out that I am referring to the Christian god. According to the Christian bible(perhaps not all Christian bibles but you understand which ones I am talking about) to get into heaven you pretty much need to believe in Jesus and ask for forgiveness for your sins. So what happens when you do not believe in the Christian god? You can't get into heaven right? So then I guess you go to hell.. Doesn't that seem like a bit much? He doesn't even seem to want to give us any real proof that he exists. He let human hands write the bibles and sure he supposedly performs miraculous healings even today but you would think with our eternal souls at stake and being all powerful he could at least show himself to us or make some crazy voice echo from the skies letting us know he is still there but no.. it's as if he is purposely trying to tempt a lot of decent people into thinking he is imaginary. Why did God even have to create hell in the first place? Then he sends us there just for not believing in his book. If he is all powerful then surely he knew that he would be creating a lot of people who he knew would not believe and would be sent to hell. Pretend for a second a kid decides to get an ant farm so he can enjoy watching them. That sounds ok right? Well what about when the kid decides to take some of the ants he doesn't like and burn them with a magnifying glass? Fry puny ants fry! If you could please give me some reasons as to how burning someone for eternity is the right thing to do to someone who doesn't believe in you I would like to hear them.	PRO	219
S63d14e3c-A9b0d93db	Hell is not a fiery place of torment	"The Catholic Church had no right to prevent people from having a personal copy of the bible because they do not have authorship of the bible. God is the author of the bible and he wants all humans to have easy access to it. The Catholic Church was afraid that once people have their own copy of the bible they will expose all the numerous false teachings such as hellfire propagated by the Catholic Church. You cannot interpret Matthew 9 by saying the ""cut if off ""part is not literal but the "" fire"" is literal. Mathew13:13-15""Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.' Matthew 13:34,35-""All these things Jesus spoke unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable he spoke not unto them:That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."" My point is Jesus used figures of speech liberally. His words should be understood in a context . Matthew 9 is another perfect example of hyperbole. Here are a few examples of hyperbole used by Jesus. Matthew19:24-""And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God"". Matthew6:3-""But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"" Matthew 7:3-5-""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."" Mark11:23-""For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith"". You are more concerned about wicked people paying a penalty for their bad deeds. When Jesus was on earth and the prostitute Mary Magdalene was brought before him, Jesus did not condemn her.He said- ""If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.......When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.""John8:3-11 Moreover,John5:28,29-"" Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."" This is very clear that dead people in the grave will be resurrected. It doesn't say they will be resurrected out of a place of torment.It says ""all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and come forth."" Also,Jeremiah7:31-""For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it. And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart."" In the context of this scripture,God was angry with Judah for burning their children to a false god. If hellfire was real ,would it not be hypocritical for God to condemn Judah for burning their children in fire when God burns dead people in fire. Medical science defines death as the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. When someone is dead they are unresponsive ; incapable of being stirred emotionally or intellectually. Its impossible to torment a dead person in fire. Matthew 12:40-'For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.' Jesus was in hell (grave) for three days. Sin came into this world through Adam and Eve's disobedience. We inherited sin. You talk of justice, so how come the original sinners- Adam and Eve- were condemned to death not to a fiery place of torment?"	PRO	220

S6cca42d6-Ae9ef9655	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (take 2)	"this will be my third go at arguing a problem of evil variant. In my past two debates (and in their comments sections) a theme seems to emerge – people disagree that more or less with the premise that there is evil in the world. There have been many different ways of doing this; you can (correctly) point out that I don't define evil, or say that evil is just an ""absence of God"" or whatever. While these arguments are useful and necessary to establish the problem, I grow tired of them, so I hope that this argument will sidestep that criticism and allow us to move on to something else. Here's the argument: if God exists, no one would go to Hell. I want to start out my mentioning that I will use Hell a lot here, but if you don't believe in Hell, the argument still applies if you substitute ""non-Heaven"", meaning just that God is incompatible with people going anywhere but Heaven. This avoids the questions about evil because by definition, heaven is good and Hell is bad. If you deny this premise, I cannot see a reason to be religious. Religions all seem to prescribe ways to get into Heaven, so if you don't agree that heaven is better than Hell, then there is no reason to try to get into Heaven. My argument formalized is this: 1. If God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. 2. If God is omnipotent, then God has the power to send everyone to Heaven. 3. If God is omniscient, then God knows how to send everyone to Heaven. 4. If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to send everyone to Heaven. 5. According to religions, everyone does not go to Heaven 6. If Hell exists and God exists, then either God doesn't have the power to send everyone to Heaven, or doesn't know how to send everyone to Heaven, or doesn't have the desire to send everyone to Heaven. 7. Therefore, either God, Heaven, or both do not exist. To the voters: please adjudicate on the basis of arguments presented in the round.

S590e959e-A19f7f51b	Scaring young children with stories of hell is child abuse	"Lets at least do our best to use logic, reason, and ultimately, the probability that something is true, and it will be clear to everyone, scaring young children with stories of hell is child abuse. More unfortunaltely though, stories of hell is abuse to their childhood, the most important learning and discovering time of their lives. Stories of hell are poisons, one of many posions spewed by those who consider themselves religious. I set you up for failure. This was over before it started. Now any sane person will tell you that you can NOT put a number on how many children need to be damaged before the words or actions of an adult are abuse. 1 child equals mental abuse Example: Jane Doe is told at a very, very young age that sinners go to hell, and if you dont follow a certain doctrine, you will go to hell if you were to follow one of thousands of other doctrines. So as a young child when you hear these things, are taught these things, and are ultimetely poisoned with by religious leaders, leads to nightmares for various reasons. However since it only takes one child to be abused, whether physically or mentally, in order for abuse to have taken place, lets get to why you were set up for failure :) ""I was reminded of the incident later when I received a letter from an American woman in her forties who had been brought up Roman Catholic. At the age of seven, she told me, two unpleasant things had happened to her. She was sexually abused by her parish priest in his car. And, around the same time, a little schoolfriend of hers, who had tragically died, went to hell because she was a Protestant. Or so my correspondent had been led to believe by the then official doctrine of her parents"" church. Her view as a mature adult was that, of these two examples of Roman Catholic child abuse, the one physical and the other mental, the second was by far the worst. She wrote""..........Richard Dawkins http://richarddawkins.net...# Now after reviewing the empirical evidence that scaring young children with stories of hell is child abuse, we see also empirical evidence that anymore than two rounds would be redundant. Not only has one child been proven to suffer long term effects because of her belief in hell, she felt it worse than her physical abuse at the hands of a trusted adult. Now any sane person will tell you that of the millions and millions of adults following doctrine that makes them believe in a hell for mistakes labeled sins, there are hundreds if not the probability of thousands of children suffer unecessarily, until the delusion they are poisoned with, is corroded away by empirical scientific evidence. Once a human admits that science is Not the devil and Not involved in a conspiracy, we call them sane. Insane people who insist that science is either the devil or a huge conspiracy, are delusional, everyone can agree to that.

Sa066f3fc-A7d94d8d6	Is God real	Hi! I would like to accept this debate and hopefully entertain argument for a good time. First, let me confirm that you are asserting God is not real/does not exist, is that correct? I just want to make sure we are both on the same page. The years in the Bible are not the same as the years today. One year is a representation of a long time period [1], and does not literally mean 365 days. So the evidence for the Great Flood could have been washed away and eradicated from history millions of years ago. Similar events to the Great Flood mentioned in the Bible have been recorded [2] and are not impossible at all. This gives us proof that the Great Flood mentioned in the Bible is not only possible, but similar events have happened, leading to the idea that the Great Flood was not only possible, but highly likely. And remember, one day is not literally 24 hours in the Bible, so rain for forty days is most likely more like a long period of rain and monsoon type weather. An example of such a great amount of rain is here [3]. Almost 500mm of rain in a month and a half, meaning for the great amount of time that rain fell in the Biblical era, the waters must have rose incredibly. God is forgiving to those who ask for forgiveness. For the people who disobey and harm mankind as well as curse God's name, there is no reason to forgive them.

S62c92cb0-A5f1498	The Bible does not tell that at death, a person goes to Heaven or Hell	"2nd Peter 2:4 is not always interpreted the correct way, while it states, “For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment” I would like to suggest that Peter describes hell here, as a place of ""darkness"". And for the evil angels, Earth is their hell. Revelation 12:9-12 tells about when God threw evil angels to thie earth, and Rev. 20 says that they will remain there until the day of judgement. 2nd Peter 2:9, ""The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished."" There is not one single soul in hellfire today. The Bible says that God reserves, or holds back, the wicked until the day of judgment to be punished. ""So shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire."" Matthew 13:40-42. ""The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."" John 12:48. Sinners will be cast into hellfire at the great judgment day at the end of the world--not when they die. God would not punish a person in fire until his case was tried and decided in court at the end of the world. Nor would God burn a murderer who died 5,000 years ago 5,000 years longer than one who dies and deserves punishment for the same sin today. ""The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."" John 5:28, 29. ""The wicked is reserved to the day of destruction."" ""Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."" Job 21:30,32. The Bible is specific. Both the wicked and the righteous who have died are in their graves ""sleeping"" until the resurrection day. ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."" Revelation 21:8. The wicked die the second death in hellfire. If the wicked lived forever being tortured in hell, they would be immortal. But this is impossible, because the Bible says God ""only hath immortality."" 1 Timothy 6:16. When Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, an angel was posted to guard the tree of life so that sinners would not eat of the tree and ""live for ever."" Genesis 3:22-24. The teaching that sinners are immortal in hell originated with Satan and is completely untrue. God prevented this when sin entered this earth by guarding the tree of life. Bible Clear - Wicked Obliterated The Bible says the wicked suffer ""death"" (Romans 6:23), will suffer ""destruction"" (Job 21:30), ""shall perish"" (Psalms 37:20), will ""burn"" up (Malachi 4:1), ""shall be destroyed together"" (Psalms 37:38), will ""consume away"" (Psalms 37:20), ""shall be cut off"" (Psalms 37:9), ""shall be slain"" (Psalms 62:3). God will ""destroy"" them (Psalms 145:20), and ""fire shall devour them"" (Psalms 21:9). Note that all of these references make it clear that the wicked die and are destroyed. They do not live forever in misery. ""So shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man ... shall cast them into a furnace of fire."" Matthew 13:40-42. ""They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."" Revelation 20:9. ""The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner."" Proverbs 11:31. At the end of the world, God Himself will kindle hellfire. As the holy city comes down from God out of heaven (Revelation 21:2), the wicked attempt to capture it. At that time, God will rain down fire from heaven upon the earth, and it will devour the wicked. This fire is Bible hellfire. ""Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it."" Isaiah 47:14. ""And I saw a new heaven and a new earth."" ""And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."" Revelation 21:1, 4. Yes, indeed, the Bible specifically teaches that hellfire will go out and that there will not be left ""a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it."" The Bible also teaches that in God's new kingdom all ""former things"" will be passed away. Hell, being one of the former things, is included, so we have God's promise that it will be abolished. If God tortured His enemies in a fiery horror chamber throughout eternity, He would be more vicious and heartless than men have ever been in the worst of war atrocities. An eternal hell of torment would be hell for God also, who loves even the vilest sinner. ""Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."" Matthew 25:41. ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."" Revelation 20:15. ""For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be."" ""The enemies of the Lord ... shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."" Psalms 37:10, 20. God's purpose is that hell will destroy the devil and all sin and sinners and make the world safe for eternity. One sinner, if left on this planet, would be a deadly virus forever threatening the universe. It is God's plan to isolate sin and blot it out of existence for all time. Eternal Hell Would Perpetuate Sin An eternal hell of torment would perpetuate sin and make its eradication impossible. An eternal hell of torment is not part of God's great plan at all. Such a horrible theory is slander against the holy name of a loving God. The devil delights to see our loving Creator pictured as such a monstrous tyrant, and he alone can benefit from such teachings. Eternal Hell a Man-made Theory The ""eternal hell of torment"" theory originated not from the Bible, but from misguided people who were (perhaps inadvertently) led of the devil. And, incidentally, no one will be in heaven because he feared hell. People are saved because they love and obey Christ. ""He will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time."" Nahum 1:9. ""For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind."" Isaiah 65:17. ""Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain."" Revelation 21:3, 4. After hellfire goes out, God will create a new earth and restore it to His people with all the beauties and glories of Eden before sin entered. The horrors of sin and the past will be forgotten. Pain, death, tragedy, woe, tears, sickness, disappointment, sorrow, and all sin will be banished forever. Sin Will Not Rise Again God promises that sin will never rise again. His people will be filled with perfect peace, love, joy, and contentment. Their lives of complete happiness will be far more glorious and thrilling than mere words could ever describe. The real tragedy of hell is in missing heaven. A person who fails to enter this magnificent kingdom has made the saddest choice of a lifetime. Also, on the Con's statement about Luke 23:43, one is left to ask: Didn't the thief on the cross go to paradise with Christ when He died? No. In fact, on Sunday morning Jesus said to Mary, ""I am not yet ascended to my Father."" John 20:17. This shows that Christ did not go to heaven at death. Also note that the punctuation of the Bible is not inspired, but was added by men. The comma in Luke 23:43 should be placed after the words ""to day"" rather than before, so the passage should read, ""Verily I say unto thee to day, shalt thou be with me in paradise."" Or, ""I'm telling you today--when it seems that I can save no one, when I myself am being crucified as a criminal--I give you the assurance today that you will be with me in paradise."" Christ's kingdom is set up at His second coming (Matthew 25:31), and all the righteous of all ages will enter it at that time (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17) and not at death."	PRO	226

Burning in hell would be the second death and God does not want anybody to suffer there, but He did not want them to be offenders."" There's no reason why burning in hell is a necessary result of a minor transgression. ""We do not execute the death penalty forminor infractions. God executes the death penalty. Mr. Hematite is held under the death penalty, on death row even though that row is as broader than the face of the planet."" Same as above. ""The tiniest infraction is punished by God.

(Isaiah 64:6) ...which does not indicate that bad deeds outweigh good deeds, or that God simply ignores them. Con: I don't see how this is connected. No matter what one has done with their life, I don't think anyone would seriously choose eternal damnation. Besides, this debate is not about what actions WILL send one to Hell, it's about the ethics of God sending people there. I don't think there is any sin or action that qualifies someone for eternal damnation which is why I think it is unethical for God to send people there. Consider the story of Faust. Ethics have nothing to do with personal opinion, but what is generally regarded as ""right or wrong"" in a construct. The dictionary defines ""ethical"" as: pertaining to or dealing with morals or the principles of morality; pertaining to right and wrong in conduct. Since the construct that we're referring to is technically God's, you cannot posit an argument about ethics that contradicts God. Furthermore, sending people to Hell is not a standard of conduct -- it is a personal decision by God within His own domain -- which, for all intents and purposes, especially given that we live in a society that accepts the concept of ownership and personal rights within one's own domain (for example, you can shoot trespassers), then nothing about God sending people to Hell is unethical. Especially, given He gives us the opportunity to avoid it. Con: By not FAITHFULLY believing. You provided a definition of this. I did provide a definition for ""faithfully believing,"" and also posited that nowhere in the Bible does it state that one must ""faithfully believe."" Con: Red herring. What can one learn from eternal damnation? They have nothing to take away from it because it lasts forever. Therefore, it is an unethical and unreasonable punishment. The ethics of punishment is not predicated on its ability to reform the transgressor. Indeed, some are beyond reform, and others don't want it. Con: Oh please. Jesus was the literal son of God and the Bible is testament to Jesus's holiness. That's irrelevant. Con: Jews do not serve Christ nor do they look at him as a window to salvation. See the source I referenced in that argument. While that does not approach my argument in any way, observe: http://jewsforjesus.org... Con: You label my simile illogical and then attempt to refute it with an illogical analogy. There are valid reasons to reject God and even your parents (consider abuse). However, you couldn't ever deny your parent's existence, now could you? After all, they clearly exist. Anyway, how exactly do we harm God by not worshiping him? Anything about Satan or the ugliness of sin won't work because Satan is basically God's subcontractor and sin was something God could've easily prevented. I don't see how you're going to dig a way out of this hole. Of course you could deny your parent's existence. People do it all the time. I said nothing about harming God -- but, He is a jealous God, which means that He feels emotion. Thus, he can conceivably feel emotional pain if He loves us and we reject Him. I'm not in a hole (wtf?). Sin is only something that contradicts God. Everything exists separately of God. Thus, free will is essentially the ability to sin. He literally gave us that ability to choose Him or otherwise. It just so happens that, after a while, it comes at a price. You can't party with God at his bungalow. Con: Do you believe the Bible predicted events? Please answer me in your next rebuttal. Not necessarily. According to the Bible, everything contained within it has already happened. Con: This comparison seems effective but doesn't follow correctly. I suppose disease = sin but we are going to sin even if we believe in God. Also, if disease = Hell... Hell is from God, so again, it doesn't work. Explain. No, in that analogy, cheating = sin. SO, that's that."	PRO	229

S37be7631-A2407e481	If both the Judeo-Christian God and Satan are real, it would be wiser to worship God.	"The Pro is trying to destroy this debate by making it seem as if Satan were dead or eternally nonexistent. If Satan has become eternally nonexistent, Satan is not real. The Judeo-Christian devil is blatantly this one: http://en.wikipedia.org... I shall quote my source so you understand what it would mean if this entity were real (and not eternally non-existent which is the equivalent of not being real) ""In Christianity the title Satan (Hebrew: הַשָּׂטָן ha-Satan), ""the opposer"", a title of various entities, both human and divine, who challenge the faith of humans in the Jewish Bible, became the name of the personification of evil. Christian tradition and theology changed ""Satan"" from an accuser appointed by God to test men's faith to God's godlike fallen opponent: ""the Devil"", ""Shaitan"" in Arabic (the term used by Arab Christians and Muslims). Traditionally, Christians have understood the Devil to be the author of lies and promoter of evil'. However, the Devil can go no further than the word of Christ the Logos allows, resulting in the problem of evil'. Liberal Christianity often views the devil metaphorically. This is true of some Conservative Christian groups too, such as the Christadelphians and the Church of the Blessed Hope. Much of the popular lore of the Devil is not biblical; instead, it is a post-medieval Christian reading of the scriptures influenced by medieval and pre-medieval Christian popular mythology."" Blatantly, if it can merely be seen as a metaphorical personification of evil, it's impossible to render Satan non-existent so I think this rather filthy form of debating should be abruptly stopped. My opponent must present a case obeying the guidelines that I set out (which he chose to alter). I specifically said that anyone who accepts this is accepting that ""Satan will punish those who served him in this life less severely the more evil they have been and that he does so by giving them privileges and higher ranks in hell but that God gives all who enter heaven equal treatment."" My opponent cannot suddenly twist this as he sees fit and instead say that ""whatever treatment Satan had previously given to his most prized evildoers will disappear, and they will fall into true hell, not the prized afterlife that Satan used to give them."" Because, if Satan were real, true hell would be the one in which Satan him/herself ruled."	CON	235
Sc9cae544-Afa3bb484	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"Your response is generally sound, with the exception of several ambiguities which stem from the vagueness of your original statement. Also, you draw at least once from an argument that I did not make, that Hell is the absence of God. That understanding of course comes from St. Augustine, but the details of our understanding of that have evolved over time. Lacking a ""Knowledge of God"" is not strictly the same thing as an ""absence of God."" It isn't simply a matter of God choosing to fill an extra space or give a little extra grace, but of forcing oneself onto another person. Taking it point by point... To my claim that ""Love"" is ""Romantic,"" and therefore reciprical, you assert: >1a) This is a completely ad hoc response. ... The only thing you provide is a biblical quote which is poetic not literal and called into question by the very nature of this debate (i.e. we're trying to decide if God exists and if he doesn't then the Bible is called into question). First, your definition of God as ""omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect"" came from somewhere. Odin, Zues and a schlew of other gods were NEVER defined by terms which are anything like these. The only conclusion which can be inferred from your opening argument, from your reference to ""Hell"" and from the definition of God which you've provided, is that you're referring to the Christian God, which is defined through the Bible. Therefore, the Bible becomes a relevant source in the definition of love. If this is wrong, and it is some other God we're discussing, please correct me. Secondly, we are not ""trying to decide if God exists,"" but specifically, whether there is a contradiction between God and Hell which proves that one or the other does not exist. This is a -technical- question which hinges upon every relevant definition, including ""God,"" ""morally perfect,"" and ""Hell."" Fine distinctions in the way these are understood matter significantly. But moving on, you assert.... >1b) That being said, it seems very likely to me that God's love does not work the way you describe. God's most common moniker is ""God the father"", indicating parental and not romantic love. In parental love, the love does not need to be requited; instead the parental figure often does things for the child against the child's will because it is in the best interest of the child. ... If God has paternal love, then your theodicy fails we are again faced with the paradox I have presented. This is easily the strongest part of your argument. A parental understanding of love is an equally valid Biblical perspective, and it is absolutely correct that parents attempt to intercede on their children's parts. But Parental Love and Romantic Love are really very similar on this abstract level. An unrequitted lover still offers kindness to the woman who rejects him, just like a father intercedes in the life of his son. The problem is that ultimately, as we understand both forms of love, love is naturally meant to be recipricated. And when it's not, there reaches a point where each intervention leads to antagonism and bitterness from the child or lover who must constantly refuse them. So that there is a point when offering someone more of yourself only leads that person to hate you further, and where ultimately, the Father and the Lover must simply pull back and leave the other person to decide for themselves. If ""morally perfect"" is in fact defined in this manner of love, as a Christian / Catholic understanding of Him is, then you do not have a contradiction. For Eternal Life is specifically, Biblically defined as ""Knowledge of God"" (John 17:3), meaning that Hell becomes an amplified form of the bitterness which comes from rejecting a lover. But according to you: >2) This argument is a false dichotomy. You are arguing that if God does not force us to love him, then people will go to Hell. I do not see why this must be so. Why can't God create a world in which everyone is free, yet everyone freely accepts God? ... So unless you can demonstrate that freedom and complete acceptance of God are, by necessity, in contradiction, the response cannot fly. ""Freedom to accept"" is not a freedom unless you also have the ""freedom to reject."" Otherwise it would mean you were programmed to accept. And to argue in favor of a world where only those who would choose to accept may exist is to argue for the pre-emptive annhilation of those who would choose otherwise. Whatever we may casually wish, it is presumably better to exist, even in Hell, than to not exist at all, but the latter cannot be tested. >3) Your argument assumes that God forcing someone to love him would be worse than Hell. This just seems false. In most definitions Hell is the worst possible state one can be in. A forced love cannot, by definition, be worse than this. I did not argue that forced love would be worse then Hell, but rather, that forced love is not love. In Christianity, God is defined by love in ways similar to what we understand on Earth, and to argue that God should force others to love Him is not arguing for a God who is defined by love. Consequently, you are calling for an oxy-moron. You are also calling for a violation of ""morally perfect"" as you understand it, for morality stands firmly against coercion. But finally... >4) This answer begs the further question of why God would create a world like this? God knew when he promised to himself not to force people to love him that it meant people would go to Hell. So, are still faced with the same question. But you are forgetting my first and original assertion. God is omnipotent, and may do whatever He wants, but sequentially chose to bind Himself to a definition of Love. Arguing that God was in any way obligated before making such a promise is a violation of your own definition of God as omnipotent. Without this promise, where there is no ""intercessor"" between God and Man, you have the God of Job, where He may torture you for whatever whim he fancies. Hence, in creating a promise which creates things the way they are, there is no ""morally perfect"" obligation on His part to avoid a reality which sends people to Hell. Such that... I formulize the argument in this manner: 1) God is omnipotent and omniscient. 2) In His omnipotence, He freely chose to bind Himself to omnibenevolence. 3) Omnibenevolence requires a fully-distinct entity to love: Mankind. 4) To be fully-distinct, Individuals must be given the choice to reject God. 5) That rejection of God is defined as Hell and experienced as an infinite magnification of the bitterness associated with the act of rejecting another. 6) We know this because it is foreshadowed in our own experiences with love. Hence, ""morally perfect"" and ""Hell"" are not contradictory."	CON	236
S781de01a-Ac6f56214	"""People enter hell trough no fault of their own"" is true."	"Thank you for your interesting and quick response. I accept your apologies for any mishaps. I am sure I made some mistakes in my reasoning here and there. It happens. Control My opponent states that I am correct in that there are factors out of our control in situations. But ultimately my point is that all(!) factors that determine our decisions are beyond our control. They aren't in the hands of other individuals either, as they are also deciding things based only(!) on factors that are beyond their control. Of course their past decisions have influenced some of the factors in turn (and you can ""call"" that a form of control), but those past decisions are also based only(!) on factors that are beyond their control. But I am unsure why my opponent even brought up the control of other individuals. Other individuals having control over our decisions has no influence on whether or not we have control. Where do thoughts come from? My opponent asks several questions starting with ""where do thoughts come from?"" and suggesting those thoughts come from supernatural sources. I have no answer to the ""hard problem of consciousness"" and although I don't believe in supernatural things I will of course in the fairness of this debate act as if those things exist. If those supernatural forces that give us our thoughts are bound by causality (as my opponent says when he is stating that duplicate souls would react the same) they will also not be in control of the factors that they base their decisions. If those forces even make ""decisions"". Comparing two Souls There have probably never been two souls in the exact same situation. The probability of that happening approaches infinitely small. But my opponent states that if two souls where(!) in exactly the same situation they would react the same. This is understandable and noble as my opponent subscribes to Causal Determinism. But this is my entire point. Imagine being Saint Peter (or whoever or whatever makes the judgement of a soul) and two souls come before you. Soul 1 is the ""double"" of body 1; a good Christian that loves Jesus. Soul 2 is the ""double"" of body 2; somebody that lived a hedonistic and evil life, filled with sin, causing other people to suffer, he is also an atheist, or maybe he even secretly believes in Jesus and isn't an atheist at all but actively hates and rejects the savings of Jesus, think of the worst person you can think of. Now you know and realise that these souls started out the same and they are shaped by decisions that where caused by factors outside of the control of these souls. Sure past decisions of soul 1 (the decisions to regularly attend church for example) influenced later decisions (giving to charity) but soul 1 had no control over the factors that steered the first few decisions of soul 1. Now soul 2 also had no control. Sure past decisions of soul 2 (the decision to skip school to torture small animals) influenced later decisions (starting a criminal gang) but soul 2 had no control over the factors that steered the first few decisions of soul 2. You state that if soul 1 had been tethered to the body 2 and soul 2 had been tethered to body 1 the roles would have been reversed. So it seems souls need to get ""lucky"" with what body they get attached to. They can't choose the body they get attached to because they are all the same before being affected by life, so they would all pick the same body. So something else chooses what body they get attached to. Now would you truly send soul 2 to hell to suffer eternally? Knowing that if soul 1 would have been in the shoes of soul 2 they would have reacted the exact same way? Knowing that your own(!) soul would have reacted the exact same way if you where tethered to body 2? If you did, you would be condemning soul to to hell trough no fault of their own. Prison vs. Hell. Even if prison was exactly the same as hell (which my opponent states it is not), it would still not invalidate the subject to be discussed as people end up in prison trough no fault of their own as I have shown, so they would logically also end up in hell trough no fault of their own. But in my opening statement I have boasted that I would show that hell is an unjust concept, as that is of course the ultimate goal of the subject of this debate. So I will need to work a bit harder on this prison vs. hell comparison as I do believe prison has it's merits where hell has not. Of course hell keeps transgressors away from those who abide by the divine law. So in that regard it shares the same function of prisons I mentioned. But is murder possible in heaven? Is theft? Is any other form of harming another? I would say no; otherwise it would not be paradise. So what is the harm in keeping transgressors and non-transgressors together? Why keep them away? They can't do any harm anyway. My opponent states that hell is not a correctional facility but simply exists as punishment. This very concept of ""punishment"" without a need for correction or teaching is unjust. The only good that comes from punishment is influencing people to do otherwise. Prisons that exist only to punish for the sake of punishing are not just. My opponent hasn't(!) stated one of the last ""uses"" of prison and hell, but might in the last round; in that it betters the lives of the victims (as they revel in knowing the people that hurt them are being hurt themselves). But I would say that feelings of revenge are irrelevant in heaven (and a sin to boot!). And a lot of murderers (and such) end up in heaven anyway as a lot of sinners choose to ""listen"" later in life. Just listen! My opponent states that all it takes to avoid hell is listen and accept Jesus saving your soul. In fact my opponent states that ""which choosing to listen is 100% a choice of ours, regardless of upbringing and such, the choice of listening is ours."" and ""Listening is our choice, it is not something that comes and goes or an event that people do not have any control over the factors."" Choosing to listen is 100% a choice of ""ours"", regardless of other factors? So if no other factors influence this choice, how come some souls choose to listen and others choose not to listen? My opponent said that ""strength of the soul"" had nothing to do with this, ""upbringing"" and other factors we have no control over (including our past choices that where influenced by factors we had no control over) has nothing to do with this particular choice to listen or not. So what is left? What determines this choice? What causes some souls to listen and other to shut their ears? My opponent has one round left to come up with a factor that the soul has control over. Summary The fact that others might be in control of our interactions or the creation of our thoughts (even if true) doesn't help this unjust system. In conclusion, according to my opponent ""All it takes to avoid Hell is listening then living"". But if this choice isn't influenced by the shape of the soul so far than all souls will make the same choice, and they will all end up in heaven or they will all end up in hell and I presume this is not the case. And if it is(!) influenced by the shape of the soul so far than that choice is not ""100% a choice of ours, regardless of upbringing and such"" because such factors shape our souls according to my opponent. In fact in that case the choice to listen or not will be determined 100% by those factors beyond our control. Endings I want to thank futurepast05 for this lovely debate. It is an important and tricky subject that deserves the attention my opponent has given it. Futurepast05 has avoided semantic discussions and has remained both courteous and frank while I ""attacked"" a subject that must be central to his core beliefs about the world.

Sc9cae544-Ae3712928	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"Let me begin by saying that I have no sympathy for the reader, and I only use debate.org as a means to flush out my own rational arguments. Consequently, I hope you don't mind if I begin by clarifying something from your comments on argument 4. Then I will go on to address your arguments specifically. ~~~ My breakup of omnipotent and omnibenevolent is done as a way of explaining the otherwise very confusing position. The Bible has wording that explains this position better than I can. ""In the beginning was the Word (active tense), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" The ""Word"" of course is the promise, Jesus Christ, and ""All things came into being through Him"" (John 1:1-3). ""Omnibenevolence"" is therefore the sole and infinite action of ""Omnipotence,"" which would otherwise be amoral, and the Catholic Church has long held that one's actions perfect a person. ~~~ 1) Romantic Love vs. Parental Love Let me begin by saying the distinction is a false dichotomy. As you point out: >The real problem is semantics ""love"" could mean romantic love, friendship, grandmotherly or ‘wise love', ‘loving-kindness'/ compassionate love or any number of other forms. While I don't think the Bible mentions ""grandmotherly"" love, all of these are applicable to God, run parallel with each other, and are given to us as a ""type"" to understand how we are to experience God. I only pointed to Romantic love as a clearer point of reference for the aspects of love I wanted to highlight. As to those aspects... #) The Reciprocity of Love I assert that love is meant to be reciprocated. >The person who gives or provides aid out of compassion for another and a real desire to improve their well-being with no desire to receive anything in return seems to be on the whole ""more perfect"" than the person who expects that love is reciprocated. The problem hinges upon the word ""meant,"" which refers not to the person loving, or even to the person being loved. Rather, love is by design, by the Designer, intended to be reciprocated. Love is a purposeful sacrifice of oneself for another person, in a way which openly exposes oneself to the other person, done because one is moved by the other person's inherent truth and goodness and beauty, but the exposing of oneself sequentially creates the Hope of being loved in return. Consequently, the intention by the Creator is that love is INTENDED to be returned, but cannot by the lover be EXPECTED to be returned. Hence, the other person must have the ability to reject the lover, and naturally experience the full actualization of doing so. This returns us to my opening remarks. A person cannot be separated from their actions. Ones actions reveal oneself to another. Giving flowers perfects the intention of giving, in the sense that the intention reaches fulfillment in the action. But a person is most defined by that which they love. So actions which reveal another person as the source of one's love consequently leave one exposed, resulting in the Hope that the love will be returned. Therefore, God bound Himself to Love, creating individuals whom He fully loves, revealing Himself through creation and the sacrifice of Christ Jesus, without the expectation of being Loved in return, but fully with the Hope that we will. This was the infinite action of Omnipotence. &) The Consequences of Rejecting a Lover It should be noted that the consequences of rejecting an Earthly lover are an aside to the discussion. I return to the definitions, that Eternal Life is ""Knowledge of God."" To this I qualify, not rational Knowledge, but Knowledge gained through intimacy - reciprocated love. Hell, then, is by definition a rejection of intimacy with God. Earthly Lovers are an aside to whether Hell is contradictory with Omnibenevolance. However, it is still the evidence. So I assert that rejecting a lover has a negative impact on one's very personhood, and that individuals may reject any form of lover with finality. >If the parent could always be there and always make the best possible decision for the child, then there would be no need to let them do things on their own. God can, theoretically, do exactly this. So, God should just force us to have knowledge of him because it is in our best interest. Or, if you don't like that proposal, he should perpetually reincarnate us until we finally gain knowledge of him on our own. Again, you're looking at things from the perspective of the lover, and not of the loved one. Imagine being loved by someone you're ashamed of... a father who loves you but hates everything you love in turn... a would-be partner who disgusts you... a friend who embaresses you... Rejecting any of these people damages you as a person, and it is an unkindness to continue putting them into the position of enacting that rejection. There is no proof of it but to experience it. ~~~ 2) ""Freedom to Accept"" and ""Freedom to Reject"" I assert that ""Freedom to Accept"" is not really a freedom unless one has the ""Freedom to Reject."" To this you agree, but add: >But, ""freedom to reject"" does not imply that rejection must actually take place. >This could be done by creating people who are rational and making it obvious that God is the most rational choice. >Again, this argument is important because if a world where freedom to reject did not imply actual rejection could exist, then a morally perfect God would not create any other world. But in this argument you are only adding another layer of fluff before reaching the same conclusion. If God created man, then He also created man's faculty of ""Reason."" You are arguing that a person should be bound by his rationality, and therefore bound to the God that created his rationality. Worthy of note is that this is consistent with reality. There is no causation between religion/atheism and intelligence. Rather, what we are experiencing today is better expressed in this way: Intelligence => Education Education => Wealth Wealth => Entertainment Entertainment => A Distraction from Religious Depth This is a consequence of our cultural circumstances. It is entertainment which distracts us from religion because it appeals to the same human faculties as religion, an appreciation of something which is created. But this distraction needn't be understood as resulting in Hell, but only as preventing an individual's personal religious growth. Hence, there is no connection between an acceptance of God and intelligence, as there shouldn't be, because God cannot make us choose Him just by making us smarter. As to your remarks on non-existance: >Also, I need to take you to task with the claim that non-existence is worse than Hell. Then I will go back to the question of whether God can simply use omniscience to tell what a person will choose, and then only create people who will choose a certain way. Doing so would create the expectation that everything which exists will love you in return, so that love would become obligation and not love. ~~~ Formalized: 1) God is omnipotent. 2) God bound Himself to Love. 3) Love is sacrifice and self-exposure, without any expectations, which creates the Hope of being loved in return. 4) Mankind was created with the Freedom to reject God. 5) A person who for any reason cannot reject God would only create expectation, violating the principle of Love. 6) The act of rejecting a lover damages a person. 7) The act of rejecting the infinite lover is defined as Hell and experienced as the infinite rejection, the infinite damage to ones personhood. 8) We know this from our Earthly experience as lovers. Hence: An Omnibenevolent God and Hell are not contradictory."	CON	239

First, a kind thank you to Mr. Hematite for accepting this challenge and allowing further explanation of why he deserves to burn in hell forever; the same as I. He deserves some applause for taking up the challenge which had to be posted a second time before anybody would accept it. It is not easy for a person to admit he deserves to burn in hell. It was not easy for me to reach this conclusion regarding myself. My theory is that most people are afraid to admit they deserve to burn in hell because they know that if it is true, they need to seek mercy from God and renounce themselves for breaking God's law. This would also require turning away from the pleasures that are found in rebellion. In these opening comments, Mr. Hematite may find more points he would like to argue against. I do appreciate his systematic and specific approach of bringing argument. I will first post his abbreviated quotes from me, and then repeat the actual quote. I will run out of available characters in this round, so I will answer Mr. Hematite's objections in the order they were posted. Death is separation from God caused... the law does not bring punishment (Hematite) ......the law is good for nothing if breaking the law does not bring punishment. (actual quote) The punishment for the tiniest infraction against God is death. The infraction itself is an offense to God, and the offender by his infraction has caused a separation between himself and God. This separation is death. The first death is in our bodies. Burning in hell would be the second death and God does not want anybody to suffer there, but He did not want them to be offenders. We do not execute the death penalty for minor infractions. God executes the death penalty. Mr. Hematite is held under the death penalty, on death row even though that row is as broader than the face of the planet. The tiniest infraction is punished by God.

Sa53f9c67-A6401ad47	Hell would be a better fate than Heaven	"Hey, sorry about how long this has been taking, I've had family stuff going on. My first point will be on the concept of Heaven, as described by the Bible. ""Heaven is designed to be a personal paradise where everything and everyone would be to the individual's favor.""

Succeeding at everything would become agonising after, say, an eternity. I'm not saying that Hell is just some grand place, it would certainly suck a lot. My second point is the concept of Hell, using your definition once again. ""It's sole purpose is to provide a punishment to those who sin. As such, it takes advantage of out brain's natural fears of anything dangerous to our body."" So, Hell is a purely physical pain. Since Con cannot yet give a rebuttal to my claim of Psychological pain > physical pain, I won't bring that up. Instead, I will point to a simple fact of life as we know it. If you get punched, it's going to hurt. Get punched again, and it will hurt more. However, eventually you reach a peak, and stop feeling as much pain from it. I feel the same will come about in Hell.

It would be considered much more immoral to harm or kill a highly respected member of society rather than the common man. The argument doesn't require societal structures at all. Surely, the immorality felt by killing an ant or a fly is much different than that of another human since the status of the human is higher than that of the ant or fly. Now when we consider Allah, a being of infinite greatness and supremacy the level of immorality rises to infinity. Many times when committing sins, Muslims are encouraged to not think of the weight of the sin but the greatness of the one we are transgressing “Do not look at the smallness of the sin, rather look at the greatness of the One Whom you have disobeyed.” [2] Since the more serious a crime is the more serious its punishment should be, all sin against Allah merits an infinite punishment. An important consideration with this idea of the level of immorality increasing with higher status is the intentionality of the sin. For example, hitting someone with your car by accident rather than on purpose is much less immoral or even amoral rather than the latter. In Islam, only intentional sin will be counted as was agreed upon in the framework in R1. An intentional sin would be someone who has heard the message of Islam, its guidelines, and freely transgresses them. People who have never heard the message of Islam will not be condemned to eternal damnation for their unintentional sins. C2: Consequences of Sin While my first contention argues that all sin (given people who have heard Islam) merits an infinite punishment based on status, this contention shows that some sins based on their consequences merit an eternal punishment. Many people who reject or who are critical of the teaching of the eternal nature of hell often say that the amount of sins are finite and thus doesn't warrant an eternity in hell. However, what they seem to focus on is the time aspect of the sin rather than their consequences. While an act of sin maybe temporal, the effects of some sins have eternal consequences. For example, consider heinous sins in Islam such as rape or murder. The consequences on the mind/soul of those affected by murder and rape are permanent for all those who have been involved. Since these crimes are arguably are primarily on the mind, their consequences are everlasting. Considering the agreed upon framework of this debate, the soul continues to exist after death and as such the effects continue to last until Allah relieves them. Irrespective of whether the damage is repaired, the punishment should be eternal. An analogy to illustrate, suppose one who was stabbed by another person was hospitalized and brought back to good health in a reasonable span of time. Simply because the pain and damage caused has been repaired, it doesn't mean that the one who wronged doesn't pay the punishment anymore. In fact, they still would pay the same penalty regardless of whether the victim was healed or not. Similarly, because the one whom sin with eternal consequences has been inflicted upon is relieved it doesn't mean the one who has committed the sin is also relieved. C3: Free Will This contention shows that Hell is ultimately a choice made by the individual and not be blamed upon Allah. On Islam this entire life is a test, it is a preparation for the next life to come. Those who are righteous and freely follow the guidelines of Islam (after hearing the message) whilst constantly repenting for their inevitable wrong doings will attain paradise and those who choose to not (after hearing the message) will reap the results of their evil deeds, eternal damnation. There is an important distinction that needs to be made when I say that one chooses to go to hell. Many times, a person would object that it is inconceivable that one would choose to go into a burning fire eternally. However they are forgetting that hellfire is a choice not in the direct sense but in an indirect one, it is a consequence of rejecting the teachings and moral guidelines of Islam. When one chooses to freely reject Islam, they are simultaneously choosing hell. This is what is meant, and it is in this way that hell fire is a choice made by the individual. - - - - - - - - - - - - In conclusion, an eternal hell is justified because of the infinite severity of intentional sin due to the infinite status of Allah. Some sins are indeed infinitely severe due to their everlasting consequences on the soul of an individual and finally, hell fire is essentially an indirect choice made by an individual when they freely choose to reject the message of Islam. All these reasons strongly support the doctrine of an eternal hell. The resolution is affirmed. - - - - - - - - - - - - Sources http://www.iep.utm.edu... [1] http://islamqa.info...	PRO	242
S5ba5941b-Ad8d4249b	Presupposing Islam is true, an eternal hell is justified.	"C1: Status and Morality I. Pro drops one point and urges us to focus on his other allegedly more sturdy point; I will do so. II. Pro seems to misunderstand the purpose of my analogy; it was a point to illustrate a reductio ad absurdum - that is, a reduction to an absurdity by showing the absurd consequences that would follow if we accepted Pro's main contention here. The analogy brings out the the motivating intuition in favor of the retributivist model of punishment - that punishment can be doled out in gradients on a ""scale of moral seriousness"", as it were. Stealing candy would be on the low end of the scale and murdering 26 people would be on the high end of the scale. In the former case, paying back the value of the item stolen (and perhaps other minor actions) can be a proper punishment but in the other case only something such as life in prison would suffice. But if that is the case - and it surely has to be on the retributivist understanding of punishment - Pro's contention collapses this motivating intuition because Pro's contention makes it so that ALL sin merits the same punishment. But this clearly goes against the retributivist understanding of punishment which is what his argument is based on. It just seems absurd that my stealing candy and my murdering 26 people could amount to the same punishment - an eternity in hell. And, indeed, if Allah is Just as he is maintained to be, it doesn't seem that a perfectly Just Judge would issue such punishment(s) - and this all brought out by Pro making his own argument. Pro has undercut himself. So, if that is truly what Pro contends then that is good reason to reject the argument and amounts to a refutation. III. This doesn't seem to address my analogy either. Despite what Pro is saying his contention that he actually takes into account the nature and seriousness of the crime it doesn't seem that it does. As my analogy clearly shows both actions are not worth equal punishment, even if they done upon the same person and that has to do with the principle of retributivism that I elucidated on in the above paragraph. But if that is the case it is unclear how the ""moral calculus"" changes so drastically when you bring Allah into the picture. If, per my analogy, you replace the 100 units of moral status of a human being with the infinite units of moral status of Allah that still doesn't show how a person one person who does minor sin A against Allah merits infinite punishment just as a person who does major sin B against Allah. In fact, if what Pro says is true there would be no distinction between ""minor"" and ""major"" sins - which, again, counts against the very model of punishment Pro bases his argument on. C2: Consequences of Sin I. Actually, my contention is very relevant here and Pro doesn't take it seriously enough because, if true, it directly undercuts support for his argument in support of C2. Pro caricatures my argument here; I never said that it ""isn't our fault if we commit major sins* such as rape or murder"" nor did I say or imply that we cannot avoid murdering or raping. What I did say is merely a truism; moral culpability diminishes the more the moral agent is impaired in the relevant ways (and I listed out some of the relevant ways in my opening round). This is obvious - it's the reason why we don't try children as adults in the court of law for various offenses. It's the reason why there are ""age of consent"" laws. But in this case (when conceiving hell) we are all in a child-like state of ignorance and having immature cognitive faculties. *Again, if Pro's points in C1 are correct there'd be no such distinction between major and minor sins here. C3: Free Will I. This is somewhat an extension of the previous point and somewhat of a new point but it is crucial. I think that Pro's contention here that ""we can have sufficient knowledge of how truly horrifying the nature of hell is"" is just out and out false. He quotes a relevant passage from the Qu'ran and, indeed, it does sound horrible; definitely not something I'd choose to subject myself to! I still contend that is a horribly insufficient characterization of hell. There is a difference here between experiential knowledge and knowledge-by-acquaintance. For instance, I have never had to watch a situation as described by Elie Wiesel but I can indeed recognize, somewhat, how soul shattering an experience that would be. [1] But that is only through empathy and paltry analogies to my own experiences and through reading his account of his experiences. I will never truly know what it is like to experience such an event, and as such it's hard for me to conceive of how truly horrifying, terrifying and despairing such an event would be. I've never been a participant (either victim or perpetrator) of such a horrendous evil. As Marilyn McCord Adams has pointed out ""where suffering is concerned, conceivability follows the capacity to experience, in such a way that we cannot adequately conceive of what we cannot experience."" [2] I have never had an experience of the nature of Wiesel's so I cannot adequately conceive of such a state of affairs. It be absurd (and insulting) to say that I could. Or, in a different situation, I could impress with all my might to a two year old how horrible it would be burned alive and that that is a ""bad"" state of affairs (per my earlier analogy) but they would not adequately conceive of such an event. This ties into my point because no one here on this earth has experienced an eternity of hell fire, and thus we cannot adequately conceive of such. We just know that it's ""bad"". Even if one has been burned before, it's hard to say how an eternity of burning would feel like. II. My points apply equally to both direct and indirect choices; in either case it doesn't seem moral to allow such a momentous choice to be left up to human beings. This would also raise the troubling point of why Allah would make such a momentous choice an ""indirect choice"" in the first place; surely if it was a direct choice and people could clearly see that such and such choice(s) would send them to hell then they wouldn't do it and more people would end up being saved. If Pro alludes to that's because it is a ""test"" that would surely impugn on the teachers character if they made such an easily failable test knowing that the students aren't up to the task. III. My question, which didn't get answered is, why the value of ""free will"" is place of the infinite disvalue of an eternity in hell. I agree that free will is valuable, but when placed next to hell? It seems a bit paltry. We clearly recognize instances wherein which another persons' choice should be overridden if they are doing something irreparably harmful to themselves in an irrational state of mind. Why can't that also be the case here? It also beggars belief to think that infinitely smart and powerful and good Allah couldn't find a way to set up a state of affairs in which people freely choose to enter in communion with him.

Sa53f9c67-Aaf83d7d5	Hell would be a better fate than Heaven	My opponent has made some pretty weak points in his rebuttal. They can all be rebuted in multiple ways. Pro point 1: In heaven, you would get bored of everything being good. It would be agonizing mentally to succeed at everything. Pro fallacy: Pro does make a good point here. You can get bored of things that make you happy. There are also millionaires who have nowhere to succeed and can often become depressed. Though who ever said heaven would let that happen? If you honestly prefer a more cozy life with your family and a small house from your childhood then wouldn't heaven provide that? The bible states that heaven would be what makes you most happy, not necessarily what makes everyone else happy. Making money and succeeding in everything will not be what most people want. For an example, think about life now. What things do you enjoy? Your family? Girlfriend? Sports? Those unconditional lovers and competitive activities would most certainly be a part of your personal heaven. If you get tired of any of these things in heaven, you could merely just move on to something more pleasurable right? If you do indeed get bored of everything being so awesome then wouldn't that not be a good thing? So you would be experiencing a bad day of boredom. So according to your own statement, those bad times would make the better days better. As for hell, there would be no good days. So you would have nothing to appreciate. Therefore your own statement can be used to counter your argument. Pro point 2: Psychological pain is worse than physical pain. Con counter point: While there are varying degrees of both of the types of pains, let's use the two types already mentioned in this debate. Boredom and burning. Have you ever been bored? Most likely. Have you ever stuck your face in a fire? Hopefully not. While being bored because you have nothing to accomplish can be agonising, you most certainly would not prefer to go bathe in a burning house to pass the time. Being bored just means you want to do something stimulating, and hell would be the last place you'd want to go to do something. Heaven has everything you would ever want. Hell has fire. So once again I can use my opponents statement against him. If what you say is true, boredom is worse than burning, then wouldn't both be even worse? While heaven can undoubtedly get boring, hell would be much more so. You have nothing to do but burn and burn. So hell doesn't solve the problem. You'd still be psychologically depressed knowing you can never feel happy or love again. So of the two evils, hell seems to be the worse of the two.	CON	245

Sedfad01e-A6d405df	The Problem of Evil and Hell	"I thank my partner for his opening reply and his clarification. This debate focuses on the Problem of Evil and the Problem of Hell. As I was beginning to prepare for this debate, my biggest trouble was what to leave out. There is so much that needs to be covered in only 8000 characters that it pains me to know that there are just some things I need to leave out. -->OPENING ARGUMENTS<-- The Problem of Evil A. The argument map B. The argument in a nutshell The argument states basically this: ""Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"" -Epicurus C. The Argument formulated If God exists, then he is necessarily omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (by definition). If proposition 1 is true, then unjustufied evil will not occur. However, unjustified evil does occur. Therefore, it is probable that proposition 1 is false. If proposition 1 is true, then unjustified evil will not occur. My partner agreed that we will discuss the God as revealed in the Holy Bible. By my partner's very own definition, he is most wise, most holy, and most gracious, and most loving. Therefore, it is unreasonable that a God who is all these things will allow something that is unjustified to come into the world. Consider the following: 4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.-1 Corinthians 13:4-7, NIV. The word translated as ""love"" is agape; [1] this is the same exact word that is used to define God in 1 John: God is Agape. Unjustified evil does occur This is where we beg the question: What is evil? I define evil as unecessary suffering; i.e., suffering that is unjustified. I contend that there are three forms of evil: Evil brought on humans by nature; Evil that we bring upon ourselves; and Evil that we bring upon oneself. [2] Let's take into consideration some of the evil that has been done: 1) In the summer of 2011, a Norway lunatic Anders Breivik slaughtered many people, including children. At one point, the children found good hiding place. Eventually, there was a man that claimed to be a police officer who told them it was safe to come out. Unfortunately, it was the gunman in disguise and they were murdered. [3] 2) During the 2005 Hurricane Katerina, over 1300 people have been confirmed dead. [4] Likewise, many children have suffered during this terrible disaster as a result of homelessness, loss of life, and loss of family/friends. [5] 3) Christianity has been, for the majority of its history, a malevolent religion slaughtering thousands of people. For example, during the protesant reformation, hundreds of Christians died because they were standing up against the Pope of Rome and demanding a reformation in the church. Consequently, they were burned as heritics. [6] 4) During the times of trouble, it often appears that poor people suffer more than the wealthy.For example, when an earthquake hits a poor nation such as Hati, more people die than in a nation such as the US. In the 2010 Hati earthquake, 3 million people were in need of an emergency after the quake. [7] Charles Bradlaugh responds: The existence of evil is a terrible stumbling block for the theist. Pain, misery, crime, poverty confront the advocate of eternal goodness, and challenge with unanswerable potency his declaration of Deity all-good, all-wise and all-powerful. Evil is either caused by God or it exist independently; but it cannot be caused by God, as in that case he would not be all-good; nor can it exists hostilely, as in that case he would not be all-powerful. If all-good he would desire to annihilate evil, and continued evil contradicts either God's desire, or God's ability, to prevent it. Evil must either have had a beginning or it must have been eternal, but according to the theist, it cannot be eternal, because God alone is eternal. Nor can it have had a beginning, for if it had it must either have originated in God, or outside God; but according to the theist, it cannot have originated in God, for he is all-good, and out of all goodness evil cannot originate; nor can evil have originated outside God, for, according to the theist, God is infinite, and it is impossible to go outside of or beyond infinity. [7] | Conclusion | The world is indeed full of suffering that is not necessarily caused by human behavior and infraction; in fact, the majority of the time, it is caused by mother nature herself. The Problem of Hell Definitions: 1) Predestination: Predetermine, decide beforehand; [8] in other words, God decides who is saved and who is not saved. 2) Free will: The ability to choose your salvation. Formulation 1. If God exists, then he is necessarily just. 2. Hell is an unjust punishment. 3. Therefore, the Christian God cannot send people to hell. 4. However, Christian theology teaches that he does. 5. Therefore, the Christian God is not just. 6. Hence, the Christian-type God is non-existent (due to contradictory properties). I would like to apologize, but I'm out of room for discussion of this argument. I wish my partner the best of luck and may the best argument win. Photo Credit 1.

God wants you to be saved, so why bring up Jesus? Jesus is no different than any other sinner in this world! Whats so special about Jesus, when there are countless other men who died for humanity. I fail to see the idea why god would send us to hell, just because we exist in the first place. We are imperfect? So let me get this straight. God made us imperfect, and for that sole reason, he would send us to hell. We exist just so we can go to hell. But, for some reason you say god is good, because he doesn't want you to go to hell, because he brought up Jesus? Why bring up the idea of hell in the first place, when all you need to do is believe in a sinner who is no different from us! ""If your living is justified by your existence, does that mean that your death in unjust?"" No, your existence being justified by hell is unjust. I would also like to know, where is your evidence that our existence is justified by hell. What is your true evidence of hell? If you say the Bible, then how do authenticate the Bible? How do you determine its reliability? I would like to hear my opponent's reply on that. ""our living cannot be justified at all and only the fire of Hell can justify your continuing existence as a breaker of God's law"" How is our existence justified by hell? I fail to see any viable reason for that. God created beings imperfectly so we can go to hell? ""God made a way for you to be saved from Hell. You can be justified by the blood of Jesus Christ and have eternal life, but you will not be justified by Him if you keep saying He was not good enough, he was a sinner."" No, god doesn't care about you. Judging by your statements, it looks like god is very selfish and immoral. He doesn't care how good about how good of a person you are. He just loves you enough because your sole existence is to burn in hell. All he wants you do is believe in Jesus (who is no different than anyone else), and he won't care about you killing, raping, insulting, or lying.

He will be arguing that PRO: You Don't Have to Burn in Hell, You Can Be Saved From It Now. and I will be arguing that: CON: You Do Have to Burn in Hell, You Can Be Saved From It Now. My opponent has stated so himself, that the main position in this debate is whether or not we deserve to burn in hell! And whether or not we can be saved from it. Since which hell hasn't been defined, I suppose my opponent has left it up to me, so we will be using the Holy Bible for our source matierials.

Indicates obligation; Must (logical conclusion) Definition of Must: be obliged to; should (expressing necessity). So, now that we've clearly defined the resolution of this debate. We have discovered that this debate is infact about whether or not we should burn in hell? Alright, So I will be arguing that we should infact all go to hell, but can be saved from it.

Revelation 20:13-15 13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the deadthat were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. Revelation 21:8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” The bible clearly teaches that(metaphorically) If a man doesn't work, he doesn't deserve to eat. every single human being should go to hell Lifemeansgodisgood should 100% go to hell as it is clearly defined in the bible that every human being should. Romans 3:10 There is no one righteous, not even one;' John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

Sf4081bc4-Abaf873fa	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	"Time to close things up. ""My opponent has decided to debate about a minor portion of the topic. The simple reality is that even if he is to prove sending to hell those who have zero chance of being saved is not decent, I believe I will still win because the vast majority of people within this topic do have a choice to accept or reject god. Since it effectively conceded that it is just to punish these individuals, then I believe I have already proved a decent god can send to hell those who do not believe. Again, we must focus on everyone, and not simply a small portion of people. Having said this, for the sake of debate I will engage my opponent on his arguments."" Here is why I should win this debate. My opponent thinks he can win the debate merely by ignoring my points but I believe my points are valid. The topic is ""A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him."" I chose to focus on the people who do not believe due to not being able to believe and my opponent thinks that because god gives most people a chance to be saved it is ok to simply ignore those who have no chance at all. I would also like to point out that although my opponent keeps referring to these people as a minority and therefore unimportant EVERY soul is important and nobody should suffer eternal damnation over something they have no control over. Also I am not talking about small groups of people here because if people truly are sent to hell for being unable to believe take a moment to think about just how large that number would be. ""As for the tribes argument, I would again like to point out this is a incredibly tiny portion of the population. And, with the spread of Christian missionaries across the world, there are few if any who no longer are aware of Christianity. If a tribe chooses to reject these missionaries, then it is right for them to face the consequences, which in this case is hell. Also, as stated earlier, if accepting Jesus and god is the only way to reach heaven, and if the tribe has not done this, then god is right to reject them."" My opponent thinks that number is smaller than it really is. Sure the Christian bible has made it to a lot of places but this was not always the case. MANY people for MANY years have lived their lives completely unable to access a bible. People have been around waaay before the bible was even created and when it was first created it took a long time to grow and spread to what it has become today. Think about how many people really had no chance to know God. ""On the argument about people from other religions, some major religions are closely tied to Christianity, and by embracing the same god, they may still be saved. Having said this, free will solves back for this argument. Even if one is raised to follow one religion, they still have the ability to embrace Jesus. If they do not embrace the correct path to salvation and instead embrace a false belief, then god has no reason to save them or offer salvation since they had every chance to embrace the correct path."" Some major religions are closely tied to Christianity yes but many of them are not. And I do not believe that free will just ""solves"" this problem. Lets pretend for a brief second that Christianity is all wrong and religion number 2 is correct and because all Christians did not fulfill the requirements of religion 2 they all went to hell. Next lets look here in America. A person is born and raised by Christian parents in a Christian community. Most likely that person will remain a Christian. There IS a decent chance because of this being the wonderful America that it is that the person may choose to adopt another religion but the chance that they will end up following the correct religion 2 is fairly small considering the vast amount of choices. So reverse this. Chances are greater if you are raised non Christian you will be non Christian. Just because the chance to be saved exists does not mean the chance to not be saved isn't higher which is why my point with other religions is valid. ""As for infants, while I can not say with absolute certainty, I am relatively certain that most sects of Christianity would send them to purgatory. I think reasonability factors into this, if Jesus washed away our sins, then infants and aborted fetuses who never had a chance to sin have no reason to be punished, meaning they would either go to purgatory or heaven. Only the most extreme sects of Christianity would argue otherwise, and we are not discussing those."" Would just like to point out that although you say they have no reason to be punished according to original sin they do. Original sin is believed by more people than you think and purgatory is also not that big of a Christian belief. Being raised as a Methodist and having friends in other various flavors of Christianity some of us were told to believe in original sin and not in purgatory because that is what our bible told us to believe. So my point here is merely that Methodist is by no means one of the most extreme sects and yet we were still made to ""argue otherwise"". ""My opponent contends that hell is an excessive punishment. But why? Those in question have rejected their creator, shown no gratitude, and lived a life detached from the road to salvation. Hell is a just punishment for those who did not seek salvation in life. God should not reward those who do not live a just life in service to him. Purgatory is also a potential destination for many in question, though I can not speak intelligently on who goes to hell and who goes to purgatory. To conclude I believe it is clear that not embracing salvation in life justifies punishment in death. I believe I am winning that nearly all people we are discussing in this debate are justly sent to hell because they have a choice. I also believe I have shown how those my opponent discusses are either not sent to hell or are sent to hell for just reasons."" My opponent is trying to say that those in question have rejected their creator. For the purpose of this debate I have focused on the people who have done nothing wrong. I am talking about people who have had either little or no chance to know that the Christian god even exists. And I would very much like for my opponent to try and justify eternal torment for people who have done nothing wrong but instead he just tries to ignore them and say that it's ok because most people have a chance to get into heaven. It's not ok. It's not ok to pick and choose who has a chance to get into heaven. A decent god would not give out such a cruel punishment to so many innocent people. I personally would like to believe that this is not the case. I would like to believe that all people have a chance to go to heaven but in the least I would like to believe that just because someone can't get into heaven then they wont be sent to hell. I would rather just god leave me alone and not put me in hell or heaven. Just let me die in peace. Wrapping this up this argument is about all of the innocent people God has given the worst possible punishment to. If any god really has sent countless good people to eternal torture merely for not knowing about him than he is not a decent god. That sounds too evil to be something that a loving god would do. You cant justify putting such a harsh punishment on so many people who had no chance to be saved. That is all. Thanks for the debate."	PRO	254

Sc9cae544-Adeae6819	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"I want to preface my arguments my admitting that I am not 100% clear on your defense. So, if I misinterpret anything, please let me know! You seem to argue that God's love is like is similar to romantic love and in romantic love, it is essential that the love be mutual. Thus, God does not force us to love him and if we don't love him, we go to Hell, which is essentially an absence of God. If that is your argument I have a few responses (numbered and lettered for ease of debate). 1a) This is a completely ad hoc response. You do not have any external evidence suggesting that ""Knowledge of God' is eternal life"" or that God's love actually does work this way. The only thing you provide is a biblical quote which is poetic not literal and called into question by the very nature of this debate (i.e. we're trying to decide if God exists and if he doesn't then the Bible is called into question). Instead, you have invented a response that happens to fit the evidence we see without providing additional evidence for this response. As long as we allow ad hoc responses, nothing can EVER be proven wrong. 1b) That being said, it seems very likely to me that God's love does not work the way you describe. God's most common moniker is ""God the father"", indicating parental and not romantic love. In parental love, the love does not need to be requited; instead the parental figure often does things for the child against the child's will because it is in the best interest of the child. A parent doesn't care what the child thinks about running into the street or if the child agrees with that decision, the parent just does what is best for the child. Seeing as God is the ""father"" and his potential status over us would be more than equivalent to the status of a parent of a child, it seems more likely that God has paternal love. If God has paternal love, then your theodicy fails we are again faced with the paradox I have presented. 2) This argument is a false dichotomy. You are arguing that if God does not force us to love him, then people will go to Hell. I do not see why this must be so. Why can't God create a world in which everyone is free, yet everyone freely accepts God? Sure, this may seem unlikely to a puny human mind, but a requirement of omnipotence is that the being can do anything which is not logically contradictory. So unless you can demonstrate that freedom and complete acceptance of God are, by necessity, in contradiction, the response cannot fly. 3) Your argument assumes that God forcing someone to love him would be worse than Hell. This just seems false. In most definitions Hell is the worst possible state one can be in. A forced love cannot, by definition, be worse than this. So, this is not in our best interest. Why doesn't God just wait and see who will love him freely and who won't and then only force those who don't love him freely? Then he can have the best of both worlds. 4) This answer begs the further question of why God would create a world like this? God knew when he promised to himself not to force people to love him that it meant people would go to Hell. So, are still faced with the same question. So, those are some of my thoughts. I look forward to your response!"	PRO	256
S570e9120-Aad0bcf7d	Your Existence is Justified By Burning in Hell Forever, if Not By the Blood of Jesus Christ	Ok, basically you are saying that Jesus is not God so it is not possible for His blood to justify you. If His blood does not justify your existence, the only other justifcation for the existence of sinners is the fire of Hell. God cannot have sin in His presence. You have broken God's law at some point, we all have. Since you insist Jesus was a sinner, then for you there is no way for your sins to be paid for outiside of the fire of Hell. If your living is justifed by your existence, does that mean that your death in unjust? Your living is not justified by your existence or you would have no death. Because you are not justified to live, all you will have is death and the only way your existence can be justified when your time is over in this world is for you to exist in Hell forever because you are a siinner turned againt God. All devils and people who have turned againt God will be turned away from God forever in the fire of Hell He remains glorified in creating you, but you will never appreciate His glory if you are burning in Hell. Hell is your homw if you are not justified to live forever. You are taking Bible passages out of context and twisting meanings. Those things are not worth answering. You are saying He was a sinner. All that is needed to say is that if your living is not justified by God Himself in that He gave His sinless blood in the Son of God as payment in full for your sin so that you can be justifed in His resurrection for eternal life;, your living cannot be justifed at all and only the fire of Hell can justify your continuing existence as a breaker of God's law. You have lost your freedom because you have broken God's law. You have lost your life because you have broken God's law. If you reject the blood of God in Jesus Christ as your justification for living by His resurrection from the dead, not only your life will be lost but your soul will be lost in Hell where all sinners will be confinied in the consuming fire of Hell so their sin can never again disrupt God's peace. If you end up stuck in Hell forever, the smoke of your torments there will rise forever as a testimony that God punishes sin. You must bear your responsiblity for breaking God's law if you reject what He did in substituting Himself to take your death, bureid, and rose from the dead free from sin to be the justifer of all who believe on Him. God made a way for you to be saved from Hell. You can be justifed by the blood of Jesus Christ and have eternal life, but you will not be justified by Him if you keep saying He was not good enough, he was a sinner. You have no way to be justifed other than the fire of Hell as long as you take that stance against God. Saying it's not fair won't keep you out of the fire of Hell.	PRO	257
S691333cb-Aaee20063	You Don't Have to Burn in Hell, You Can Be Saved From It Now.	"Thank you Con for what looks like a debate wihere you are putting up arguments worthy of my time to read. First, I want to clarify some things my opponent says I said when I have not said them in this debate. It's not fair for my opponent to be putting words in my mouth, even though I may agree with him in some of the things he says I said. If my opponent is going to say I said something, he should quote it without adding words to it. My opponent says, and I will quote him exactly, that I said the following things I never said in this debate: 1) ""My opponent has stated so himself, that the main position in this debate is whether or not we deserve to burn in hell! And whether or not we can be saved from it."" The main position of this debae is ""you do not have to burn in Hell."" I made it clear in the opening argument that my opponent was supposed to debate from the position of ""I have to burn in Hell"". This debate was not intended to be about ""you"", the readers. It seems my opponent is trying to win this debate by taking my postion and not arguing the Con postion as in my opening statement; quoted with no words added or taken away, which he was supposed to be agreeing to upon acceptance of the challenge. ""The Con position for this debate is ""I have to burn in Hell"" Upon acceptance of this challenge, Con agrees to debate from the position directly opposite of Pro, which is ""I have to burn in Hell"". 2) ""Alright, So I will be arguing that we should infact all go to hell, but can be saved from it. While my opponent will be arguing that We don't deserve hell and can be saved from it."" Again, my opponent is putting words in my mouth. When my opponent claims that I said something, he should be able to show the qoute. I never said we don't deserve hell, I cannot argue from that standpoint; we do deserve Hell. I fully agree with my opponent in this statement of his which I qoute without putting words in his mouth: "".....we should infact all go to hell, but can be saved from it."" My opponent in this statment is taking my postion for this debate and is not arguing as he implicitly agreed to do by accepting this challenge. My opponent is supposed to be arguing from the standpoint of ""I have to burn in Hell"". My opponent has dropped the argument before taking it up, put words in my mouth, and is now arguing from my postion implying that my position was different from what was clearly stated in the resolution and my opening argument. My opponent is trying to change the debate resolution into ""we should infact all go to hell, but can be saved from it"", and trying to change my postion into ""We don't deserve hell and can be saved from it."" My opponent should lose conduct points for this kind of misleading and fraudulent attempts to put words in my mouth and change the entire debate. My opponent should not have taken this challenge. I agree with all of the Bible quotes and applications used by my oppenent in his argument, but he is taking my postion and claiming it as his own."	PRO	258
S91b6b383-A24716c1c	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"John 3:16 says, ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" https://www.biblegateway.com... I would like you to observe the following Venn diagram that I have made regarding this: In the black section we see aborted fetuses, or 'babies' (another issue I will regard later on). These entities do not believe in God and John 3:16 only states that those who believe in Jesus, and by extension God, are permitted eternal life. Another issue with John 3:16 is that while it guarantees eternal life for those who believe in God, if those who did not believe in God 'perished' and did not have 'eternal life', then how would they be punished for eternity in the first place? Isn't hell supposed to be eternal agony? If you simply have your soul and body perish in hell then that might just be the cure for boredom many sinners had wished to find in life. Psalm is someone stating that they thought they were sinful at birth. A fetus has not yet been born. It then goes on to imply 'sinful from the time my mother conceived me'. The fact that it states 'mother conceived me' and not 'parents conceived me' and doesn't even point to the father figure implies that this individual thought conception was something other than the formation of a zygote and was not referring to the sexual production of them but rather their 'conception' into this world (which was funnily enough the 'birth' they'd referred to in the previous sentence). Back when the Bible was written people didn't know all that much about how children were conceived, many thought that sex was just something fun to do with your partner and that the marriage itself encouraged a randomized birth rota to commence in the wife. There was literally no understanding of the direct link between sex and birth. Thus, the sexual conception of the child could not possibly have been what this was referring to. He probably was just reiterating what he meant. If everyone was sinful from the time they were conceived getting into heaven would be impossible and an unfair uphill struggle that would encourage no-one to believe in the religion an everyone to be disgusted at how unfair God is. Thus, the correct interpretation of it must be that only from the time you enter the world and actually can remotely act and think are you judged. Another issue entirely is that there is no such thing as an aborted baby, making this resolution impossible for Pro to uphold. Aborted fetuses going to hell would be another debate entirely. As for the notion that God sends the 'aborted babies' to hell, this is also impossible as the body clearly remains on Earth no matter what. If the resolution meant that he sends their souls to hell, it should have specified this as the soul is not the aborted baby as a soul cannot be aborted in the first place since abortion is a purely organic process. I conclude that this resolution has not been fully upheld by Pro as yet and that it is, in fact, impossible to uphold."	CON	259
Se409bef7-A2a887361	You deserve to burn in hell; the same as me.	"There's no more argument to present. If Mr Hematite refuses to admit he deserves to burn in hell the same as me, that is his choice. But presenting me with the choice of either side is not debating, it's a question. You need to provide arguments that go beyond various restatements of your HEAVILY religious denominationally biased view. I did answer all of his objections and denials logically in the debate. No, you didn't even remotely respond to all of them, and the ones that you did respond to, you just reasserted your core religious views and made baseless and biased assertions. Almost my entire Round 1 argument was left unanswered, especially my core rebuttals to your initial assertions, such as the fact that infinite suffering cannot be ""deserved"" by someone who makes a small transgression (punishment fits the crime, this is a basic human justice concept), and the fact that he can just separate the ones who actually DO deny his law and the ones who don't deny his law but just slip up now and then. Hell AND heaven. How can I say ""you deserve to burn in hell, the same as me"" without preaching? It's a preaching statement at the start, and it's preaching still. Your sentence right after this is what I mean when I say you are just preaching. It is rather ironic you preach right after saying this. God loved us so much He paid for our sins with His own blood and if we trample His blood under our feet saying it was nothing that the Creator died in our place to be our Saviour, then be sure He will be the Judge who sends us away into whatever punishment He sees fit for us and we deserve it. ""be sure He will be the Judge who sends us away into whatever punishment He sees fit for us and we deserve it.""

You see, many versions of the Bible describe Heaven as perfect, and everyone and everything there is perfect. I, personally, think that the reason people have an ingrown will to survive is so that we can get better at what we do. You can't get better than perfect, so I would have no reason to be ""alive"", but couldn't kill myself. Imagine trying to do anything competitive that you enjoy doing, whether it be a sport, or gaming, or your job of of involves that kind of thing, but all the competition is useless, because everyone is perfect at it, at your exact skill level, and you can't strive to be better. That would drive me, personally, insane, or at least depressed. Hell, on the other hand, is physical pain. Nothing more, and nothing less. Yes, I'm aware that it's a whole bunch of pain, and it never ends, but neither would eternal depression / insanity. So, yeah, that is why I think it. I await Con's argument."	PRO	261

S90bab8b7-Afb569e4c	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	"A.The Killings of God 1. The only interpretation I can get is that my opponent believed there was witches. If that's not what my opponent is saying, then I'm sorry. 2. My opponent says that it was to, basically, show the power of a prophet and to punish the parents. Killing an animal than eating that animal, so that the killing has two purposes and making it more efficient, would have been just as affective with more benefits. About punishing the parents, this is unfair to the children. Why not just punish the parents and take in the children and teach them ""God's way."" 3. There are two things I'd like to address. The first being that my opponents says, ""This command seems to be directed to the Medes and Persians,"" but it never says so in context. Because of this I'd like to say that this is undecided due to lack of evidence of both sides. The other thing I'd like to address is, ""You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me."" (Exodus 20:5) This is god admitting to being jealous, which against one of the seven deadly sins but that's not relevant. So I see this as God punishing people because of his jealousy, which doesn't seem very ""just"" of God. Note: My opponenet claims that only the Old Testament is valid, which is a comman claim. I don't see why we should disclude the New Testament because both Testaments were written by or with the influence of God. Maybe his point is that the Old Testament and New Testament have nothing to do with each other, but again I'd like to say that both were written with the influence of God so I think they both should be thought of as a intertwined to each other. B.God Endorsed Slavery ""Endorse - Declare one's public approval or support of"". Is God not approving slavery? Is he saying that it's okay to own a slave? Yes. I've given a Bible verse already showing that God approves it. That's all I have to say to end this topic. C.God is Not Just, Nor Does He Have A Heart 1. God says he's almighty himself. (almighty - Having absolute power; all-powerful) 2. I believe I know what you're saying now, if I do, I'm perfectly fine with that Hell. I was basing my argument off the fundamental thought of Hell. (this statement is going off what you say in ""D.What's the point of Hell"") 4. My opponent says,""My opponent keeps inserting how she feels and what she views as if everything evolves around her opinion"", but I never stated anything even remotely close, I'm saying I can't conceive why a God would be so, in my opinion, cruel. My opponent also says, ""My opponent also wants God to allow His creations to do their own will without punishment.,"" even though I satated, ""I made this section to argue about the reasoning of Hell eventhough it helps nobody. I would understand Hell if God sent us back to mortality, to try again, or into Heaven after a certain amount of time."" In this quote I'm saying that would seem much more useful if we gave people a chance after Hell to put what they've learned into affect or giving them a timed punishment, not that no punishment should be issued. (This statement is directed to the fundamental thought of Hell and I'm okay with no response to this subsection.) D.What's the point of Hell As I said in C-2, I'm perfectly fine with you definition of Hell.

Because it is the final round, I'm not going to go deep into the rebuttal; rather, I'll make a few quick notes. 1. Fallacy of Equivocation My partner has accused me of the fallacy of equivocation. Pro's rebuttal commits the fallacy of high redefinition. He takes our very broad definition of round 1 and cherry picks one attribute in an attempt to show an inconsistency. It is true: God is love. However, it is also true: God is not just love. Pro is straw manning my possition. I argued that because of God's attribuites, he is self-contradictory (incoherent). Hence, the argument is as follows: 1) Anything with contradictory attributes cannot exist. 2) God has contradictory attributes. 3) Therefore, God cannot exist. Because we are only debating the PoE and hell, this is irrelavent for now. However, the whole argument was that because God is agape, He cannot keep any record of wrong. 2) Out of context. My partner accused me of bringing the quote out of context. But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. (Ezekiel 18:21, What I was arguing was, via Ezekiel 18, the doctrine of original sin (which is my partner's theodicy) is contradicted. He has not refuted that; and in fact, only added to my argument. Those are two points I felt was necessary for this round. As a closing remark, I thank my partner for participating in a scholarly debate with me. This debate has concluded.	PRO	264
S5d7afbec-Abb29cfa8	According to the Bible, ghosts are not real.	"Just to clarify, I don’t believe in ghosts but I do not think your resolution is accurate to the bible. Both Jesus and his disciples confirm that ghosts exist. There are references in the bible of spirits of the dead appearing to living people. Assuming all spirits immediately go to the afterlife, which is not justified, why could they not still appear on earth as a vision? In other words, just because we see them does not mean they are on earth. Jesus and the disciples confirm that ghosts exist In Matthew 14:22-33 the disciples saw Jesus walking on water and assumed he was a Ghost, “When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.” The disciples think Jesus is a ghost after his resurrection and he reassures them in Luke 24:39, “Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."" Jesus and the disciples confirm that ghosts exist; this is enough to refute your resolution. It’s also important that he never warns them that ghosts are all actually deceptive demons. Why did Jesus let this obvious deception go leaving them ignorant of the danger in believing in ghosts? I concede that Jesus and passages in scripture warn that the Devil and demons can be deceptive but why in all of scripture are we not warned that ghosts are actually demons if this is true? There are examples of the dead appearing to the living in scripture This alone is enough to stop your resolution. There are two examples of Ghosts appearing in the bible. -Samuel Saul consulted a medium in 1 Samuel 28:9-21 to consult with Samuel's ghost and they have a conversation. The medium can actually see Samuel and describes him, “’I see a spirit coming up out of the ground.’ ‘What does he look like?’ he asked. ‘An old man wearing a robe is coming up,’ …Samuel said to Saul, ‘Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?’ ""I am in great distress.’” Notice this is against God’s command but he has allowed it and that Samuel describes being forced and appears visually to the medium. -Moses and Elijah In Matthew 17:3 Moses and Elijah are seen by Peter, James and John speaking with Jesus, “And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.” Moses and Elijah appear to the living after death. These are examples of ghosts appearing so there are at least three ghosts in the bible. The bible condones the belief in Spirits and an afterlife This makes ghosts more likely than a skeptical world-view. The bible never makes it a rule that spirits cannot appear on earth (whether they are a vision and are currently in heaven/hell or literally visiting earth) and if this were a rule there are many examples of God making exceptions to the laws of nature with miracles and his commands. I’ll give you my take on the Lazarus parable next round since I think it improves my position. The Bible acknowledges that you can communicate with spirits in the afterlife Mediums and spiritists are condemned as evil in the bible in Lev 19:31, 20:27, 2 Chron 33:6 and there are many other examples. Duet 18:10-13 states, “Let no one be found among you …who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.” This acknowledges that there is direct contact between this world and the next. The only medium example in the bible I am aware of, the Samuel incident above, the medium actually sees the spirit. You assume that it you go to heaven or hell immediately It’s possible that they can become trapped or hang around for a few days, which is a typical explanation for ghosts [2]. You need to establish this from scripture. You are limiting God here and simply making an assuming that he would never allow this. The bible already establishes that spirits are real making ghosts a lot more likely Assuming all dead people are in heaven or hell, why couldn’t we see them there? There are many examples of visions in the bible. Revelation and Daniel are chock-full of them. You assume ghosts are all demons but isn’t a vision of someone currently in hell/heaven a plausible alternate explanation? There is no reason to suspect that the ghosts are necessarily on earth and this isn’t some intersection with the spiritual plane. Your understanding of ghosts does not par with standard definitions You did not define ghost so here are a couple definitions from thefreedicitonary.com 1. The spirit of a dead person, especially one believed to appear in bodily likeness to living persons or to haunt former habitats. 2. The center of spiritual life; the soul. 3. A demon or spirit. Notice the first definition defines a ghost as a spirit of a dead person that is not necessarily on earth and this is typical. Three defines a demon as a ghost and both definitions are compatible with the bible but you assume a ghost must be spiritually present on earth. - Jesus and his disciples confirm that ghosts exist. There are at least two examples of dead spirits appearing to the living in the bible. My opponent is making a positive claim that the bible says there are no ghosts. This is simply not true. It is vague on the topic and, if anything, there is a decent biblical case that they do exist. Well that should do for now good luck. Looking forward to your arguments.

All you have done here is explained the Christian perspective on Heaven and Hell. I am well aware that Christians think that Heaven and Hell are rewards for our actions in the world, but I am rejecting this notion as compatible with the concept of God. here are my responses: 1. My 4th premise is ""If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to send everyone to Heaven"" you have not disagreed with this and you have not disagreed that God has the power to do so (in fact you say outright that he does) so why would a being with both power and desire to partake in an action fail to partake in it? This is a direct contradiction and it needs an answer from you. 2. Your response leaves the rather large question of why there is a world at all. I agree that it's hard to live right in this world, so why doesn't God just skip this world and create us directly into heaven. In fact, it seems to me that moral perfection would be to create an infinite amount of souls in Heaven so that they can experience infinite good. 3. Prima facie, it seems to me that infinite punishment (Hell) for a finite transgression (living poorly) is unjust. How can we continue to all God moral if he does this? To conclude you have just not interacted with my argument at all, you have merely restated the Christian perspective. To proceed please either reject a premise from my argument or the arguments soundness of validity. Thanks."	PRO	267
S6cca42d6-Ac59960a6	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (take 2)	Ok if my first argument was short, then I will take your responses and answer them separately. 1) You said that if God is morally perfect the He has the desire to send everyone to Heaven. And yes I did agree with you on that. But I will say that just because a being has the power to do something does not necessarily mean they will do it. Any being has the desire to do a lot of things for themselves and even others. Just because someone has the desire to do something does not mean they will do it. Yes, God has the power and the desire for everyone to go to Heaven. But we as people have to take certain steps in order to be able to enter Heaven. There is no getting around it. I could sit here and get into a huge discussion about the Bible and what God says we have to do in order to be able to enter Heaven, but there is not enough space nor time. To narrow it down, we have to accept that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and we have to accept him in our hearts as our Lord and savior. If you don't do that in your lifetime, then you will go to Hell, and that is the honest truth. 2) There is a world because we were all created by God to worship Him. It clearly states in the Bible that if we as his creation does not worship Him, He will make the rocks cry out and worship Him. That is why there is a world. 3) Just because someone lives poor does not necessarily mean they will go to Heaven or Hell. It is not where the live, their income amount, or who their friends are, it is how their relationship with God. If they are not saved and they have not done the things required to enter Heaven then yes, they will go to Hell. But if they do everything God tells to do and lead Godly lives then they will enter Heaven. Like I said, it does not matter their income or anything that, things like have nothing to do with how their spirit sits with God.	CON	268
S62c92cb0-A283cfcba	The Bible does not tell that at death, a person goes to Heaven or Hell	"Thank you Pro, I’ll present my rebuttals. I’ll dispute your claims about 2 Peter, and I’ll cite the Greek. The Greek term stems from the word Tartarus. Tartarus, in Greek myth, is a kind of torture pit where damned souls are sent to be tortured after death. It is the Greek hell, in opposite to Elysium, the Greek heaven. There are folks in hellfire today. There is no “second chance”. Once you are damned, you are damned. Even you say “The Bible says that God reserves, or holds back, the wicked until the Day of Judgment to be punished”. Where are they held? Where are the believers held? Final Judgement happens because of Christ’s return. It is not only to Judge the sinners. Most of your quoted verses are simply reinstating my points. You are only judged finally on Judgement day, hence the title, when the rest of the living believers and sinners are scooped up and judged. Those who have been waiting in Hell will be counted and damned finally – “the second death”. As for your dispute of Luke 23:43, I you are incorrect. He says “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” Why would he assure a man, dying, that he would be with him today in Heaven? The Greek text reads like this “And he said to him, truly to you, I say, today with me you will be in Paradise” (Comma’s in the correct places). John 20:17 in full ""Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.’” This verse is nowhere near as black and white as you say it is. It is more likely that Jesus was referring to that exact instance, as in, he is saying, I’m not a resident of earth anymore, I’m a resident of heaven. He’s making it clear that the “best part” of the resurrection is not being returned to earth, but rather that he gets to go to heaven. “Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.” - Luke 23:46 It would also appear that Jesus, when he died, gave up his spirit to God. Why would he say this? These are important words, after all, most folks there probably thought they would be his last. “While he (Jesus) was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.” - Luke 24:51 That verse just says it. He was taken up to heaven. Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. - 2 Kings 2 And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” - Acts 7:59 Stephen proclaimed that when he died. “Martha said to Him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?” - John 11:24-26 Eternal Hell is a punishment. It is not like Earth. It is the final resting place of those who did not believe. It does not “perpetuate sin”. It isn’t therapy. It’s Hell. Once you are in Hell, you are in Hell. You are not destroyed. You are punished. “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life” - Matthew 25:56 -"	CON	269
S62c92cb0-Ac5c4629e	The Bible does not tell that at death, a person goes to Heaven or Hell	"Thank you pro, like Abe Lincoln said “Sir, my concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side, for God is always right”. The bible quite clearly says that upon death, a soul is either damned to Hell or sent to Paradise. I believe that both of these places are not be the final Paradise or the Final Hell, which would both give purpose to the Resurrection, and allow for the Hell described here: “For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment” - 2 Peter 2 It is quite clear by this verse that there is a Hellish waiting room, if you want to call it that, where one waits for Final Judgement. Another Example: “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire” - Rev. 20:14-15 “But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” - Rev. 21:8 Revelation is a very difficult book, but it would appear that this death takes place after the first: Matthew Henry Commentary for Rev. 21:8 : “They must die another death after their natural death; the agonies and terrors of the first death will consign them over to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death” If the second death leads to Eternal Hell, the first death must lead somewhere. It is only logical, and thankfully for us, 2 Peter 2 just says it. Rev. 21 is all about “A New Heaven and a New Earth”. So, we can use this logic to approach the ideas of Heaven and the Judgement’s Heaven. “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away..."" - Rev. 21:1 “He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.” - Rev. 21:6-7 It’s pretty much black and white. There will be “a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away”. The first heaven is described here from Jesus’ own mouth, when he is going to die, he reassures a believer hanging on a cross next to him: “Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”” - Luke 23:43 He says today. Not at judgement. “No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.” - John 3:13 Thank you Pro, I await your reply."	CON	270

Your freedom as a sinner cannot be justifed, you will be imprisoned in the fire of Hell to satisfy God's justice against you.........if you don't repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be justified through faith in His sinless blood in His bodily resurrection for eternal life.

Sed1fbd0b-A550c6ae2	Proof That God is Real	"Many are seeking proof that God is real. They stubbornly argue, ""prove that God is real!"" My questions are these: 1.) What is it that I could say that would cause you to change your mind? 2) What exactly do you want God to prove to you? 3) Why do you think He has to prove anything to anyone? One could argue about creation Vs. the big boom, or one could argue about the existence of things that can't be seen with the naked eye, like air or love. Although these arguments are true and good, for the most part they won't change a persons mind. Those, along with many other arguments have been going on throughout history, and I'm guessing that not many have been convinced. The real proof is in a personal relationship with Christ Jesus, believing in Him is the first step, sincerely seeking the will of God is the next. Those who know, simply know that He is real because they have that personal relationship. Yet, those who believe in Jesus are not seeking proof. They are seeking the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus Himself addressed this, ""proof,"" issue when He told Thomas this: John 20:29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. What kind of ""proof,"" would make you believe? How many have attempted to ""prove,"" to you that God is real? I'm guessing that if anyone takes this debate, that person will say that many have tried to convince him or her. In the bible there is an account of a rich man and a beggar. Both die, and the rich man goes to hell. The rich man begs to have the poor man warn his five brothers of what lies beyond this life so that they won't end up where he ended up;. The response was that ""They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them."" The man replies,""Nay, but if one who has died went to them, then they would believe."" And the final response was: Luke 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. I believe that those who are seeking proof really do want to know Him, and the answers are right in front of them yet they, like the brothers of the man in the above account haven't set their heart to seek the truth for themselves. The odds are highly likely that nothing that I or anyone else says will produce the ""proof,"" that will change a person's mind. Why are you seeking proof through others rather than seeking it in Christ Jesus? The truth is, one did die and was raised to life and still many do not believe. Now, I can picture the arguments that will come up. I'm pretty sure I've heard them all. But go ahead and set your arguments in order. Along with that, please tell me what I could say that cause you to change your mind? If you have no interest in a debate that involves scriptures, then don't accept this one because every response will involve the written word."	PRO	275
S90bab8b7-Aaf38f0d3	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	"Christianity says that God is ""just"", ""fair"", and ""benevolent"",but this list evidence completely contradicts that. A.The Killings of God God has killed a little over 2 million people and the Devil, the embodiment of evil, has killed a mere 10. [1] Not only that, but That's against Gods sixth Commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill."" [2] Also, God orders many people to kill in his name. [3] B.God Endorsed Slavery God, the ""benevolent"", says, ""However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.""

Sae4582df-A8c773a7f	God is real.	"Thank you for taking this debate. A sentence from your first point: Just because God as he is defined transcends our own comprehension does not negate his existence. My retalitaion: From a secular stand point, there is flaw in this statement. That statement could be taken as, ""Just becuase it may be impossible for us to understand, it doesn't mean it's not true."" If something is beyond our own comprehension, therefore beyond our own intellectual ability, we cannot understand it, or, for that matter, make a declaration of its validity. To reiterate what you said, ""Can YOU, personally show me the reasoning and evidence behind it? no, of course you can't."" You stated that as he is defined transcends our own comprehension, therefore you are stating that you cannot give any proof or evidence as to his legitimacy. In your following paragraph, you made the assumption that I believe in the Big Bang Theory, which is incorrect. Therefore, there is no need to argue voided information. I also see no need as to present my reasoning for the creation of man--seeing as that is not the debate. Your second point: Well your first make a generalization that religion is for the fearful, and that people who believe in religion are inherently fearful. this is obviously not true for every one and it cannot disprove God. My retaliation: I am not making a generalization but instead an observation. People worship their respective Gods because, as previously stated, they fear the consequences (e.g. Hell, eternal damnation, etc.). Your point that that statement was not true because everyone and it cannot disprove God, has flaw because--neither does it prove God. As stated before, humans fear the unknown. Something that cannot be proven nor disproven is unknown. I would like to reiterate that people worship their Gods under the assumption that he does exist. Them not known whether or not he exists validates my point that they could be worshipping through fear. A sentence from your third point: Just because we have the free will to chose how we want to believe in god, does not disprove his existence. My retaliation: I would like to reatliate at that point with a question: If God was real, wouldn't he decide how we believe in him? If God, the all powerful, all knowing, does not have the ability to define himself in a way where everybody can worship him in the correct manner, does not that negate his abilities? If God can't decide under which form he wants people to worship him as, or what way to praise is the right way, he does not exist. Your fourth point is under the same principle as your third, but you do introduce the senctence, ""Freewill does not negate His existence"" Never once did I state that freewill negates God. I said that it is God's lack of defining himself that negates him. If there are so many religions, so many Gods, why can't the all powerful ""real"" God just pop down for a few days a let everybody know that he's the real one? Your final point questions my comparison between God and the government. I would like to state that I never said God was the government, or government was God. I was simply making a comparison. This comparison was to put in perspective the ""fear factor"" or worship. Borderline royalists during the old monarchy days in England, would not defy the king, no matter what. They would have faith in the king no matter his choice, because they were afraid of paying the price. This comparison was simply there to expand on the idea from my second point, that people worship because they are afraid. SUMMARY: I would urge anyone and everyone to vote ""Con"" for this particular debate because I have introduced numerous explanations that dispel God. All of my information presented can lead to the point that: God is a creation of the human mind; thus not real. However, my opponent has only introduced points that lead to the conclusion: Well you can't disprove him. However, I have disproved him by finding the flaw throughout history and the current day contradictions set forth by multiple religions, including Christianity. I have enjoyed this debate and appreciate my opponent's willingness to attend."	CON	279

Yes, God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfect in every way imaginable. He does have the power to send everyone to Heaven, He could if He wanted to. The key words here are ""could"" ""if"" and ""wanted to."" Just because someone has the power to do something does not necessarily mean they will. God gives us a choice. If we chose to be bad and not live the way we should, then when we die, our spirit goes to Hell. But if we live like He tells us to and choose to be good our whole lives, then we go to Heaven. Think of it as a ""reward"" so to speak. It is not easy to be good. We are tempted by everyday evils and if we are good and do not choose the evil path, then our reward at the end of our life time is going to Heaven, or a place of nothing but good and peace. God wants us to all go to Heaven, but WE have to make our own decision, He cannot make it for us. So what I am saying here is that God has the power and knows how to send everyone to Heaven, but it is our decision. How we lead our lives in our human form on this earth will determine whether our spirits go to Heaven or Hell."	CON	280

I have returned to DDO after my kinda longish departure for personal reasons. I'd let to set the context for this round since the instigator has not fully done it himself: to assume that God and Satan are real is also to assume that all christian/biblical texts are correct. Following this logic, we can assume that after God defeats and forces Satan into nonexistence as predicted in Revelations [1], whatever treatment Satan had previously given to his most prized evildoers will disappear, and they will fall into true hell, not the prized afterlife that Satan used to give them. After this, the original followers of the Christian God will live forever in his ""kingdom"" while the ""sinners"" will remain in hell forever, or disappear into nonexistence. If Satan loved Hitler before he was defeated and spared him pain, Hitler will be thrown down to the petty criminals' level of suffering. We can also assume something else from this. Since we are following Christian doctrines, God is more powerful than Satan.

My opponent in round 1 claimed my position is different from his position and then argued from my position claiming that I have to argue the opposing position. It was clear in the opening statements of the resolution that I wanted an opponent who would argue that they have to burn in Hell. I stated this clearly in the following quotes from the resolution: 1) The Con position for this debate is ""I have to burn in Hell"" Upon acceptance of this challenge, Con agrees to debate from the position directly opposite of Pro, which is ""I have to burn in Hell"". 2) Is there anybody who believes they have to burn in Hell so I can try to show them why they do not have to burn in Hell and how they can be saved from it? This opponent should not have accepted this challenge as by accepting he was supposed to be agreeing to argue from a defined position with no need to change my position or his by twisting definitions. My opponent has hijacked my position and that is why I agree with his Bible quotes and applications of those quotes. Because he is using what would have been my arguments in support of my position, all points for arguments should be tied. All points for conduct should go to me since my opponent never should have accepted this challenge to start with as he apparently had no intention of arguing from the con position of ""I have to burn in Hell"". This debate was not about everybody else. This debate was intended to be between me and an opponent who would argue ""I have to burn in Hell"" My opponent did not drop the ball in this debate, he never picked it up to start with.

I will attempt a repeat of this debate with more careful selection of an opponent so I can be sure my opponent will argue the Con position and not try to usurp my position and fraudulently claim victory by doing so. The positive contention I made from the beginning remains unchallenged in this debate because my opponent is not arguing the Con position. Pro was ""you don't have to burn in Hell......"" Con was supposed to be ""I have to burn in Hell"" Again, my positive opening statement of ""you don't have to burn in Hell"" remains unrefuted while my opponent claims I have made no positive argument statement. My opponent has completely failed to even begin arguing the con position and until he does, we have nothing to debate.

Sc9cae544-A72559c20	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"I'm going to do something a little unusually here. I'm going to admit when we are not likely to settle an argument or when an argument is not likely to go anywhere. Hopefully this will lean out the debate and make it more streamlined. But, before I get to the point by point, I would like to admit that this is one of the better responses to this problem of Hell that I've heard. Naturally, I don't think it solves it and I still think the problem of Hell is a huge one, but it's interesting to know that decent responses exist. 1a) I'm just going to drop this argument. I use it mostly as an old standby against the free will defense to the traditional problem of evil and I find it persuasive in that context. Here, it's not as useful. Additionally, even if I'm right, I'm not sure that this gets me anywhere. So, I'm going to move on. 1b) I think we're both on the same page here in thinking that this is my most powerful and intuitive argument. Your response seems to hinge on two claims: ""The problem is that ultimately, as we understand both forms of love, love is naturally meant to be recipricated."" ""when it's not, there reaches a point where each intervention leads to antagonism and bitterness from the child or lover who must constantly refuse them."" First, I want to disagree with the claim that ""love is naturally meant to be reciprocated"". At first this argument glance seems intuitive. Usually when you love someone in any form, you do expect that they will love you back. However, this seems more like a weakness of humanity than a universal definition of love. It seems to me that the purest form of love is the love that expects nothing in return. The person who gives or provides aid out of compassion for another and a real desire to improve their well-being with no desire to receive anything in return seems to be on the whole ""more perfect"" than the person who expects that love is reciprocated. The real problem is semantics ""love"" could mean romantic love, friendship, grandmotherly or ‘wise love', ‘loving-kindness'/ compassionate love or any number of other forms. In some of those forms of love, reciprocation is important (romantic in particular), in others it is not necessary. Since we have no reason to think that God has only romantic love instead of other (and more perfect) forms of love, we have no reason to think that love requires reciprocation. So, I hope to have demonstrated that a true form of love does not need to be reciprocated. The second part of your defense is that at a certain point, intervention leads to bitterness and antagonism. I don't see how this actually interacts with the parent analogy. In parenthood, sometimes the parent must do things that lead to the child becoming bitter and antagonistic, but they do it if it is in the child's best interest. Sure, at some point parents must stop intervening and allow children to handle things for themselves, but this is really due to a fault of the parents. If the parent could always be there and always make the best possible decision for the child, then there would be no need to let them do things on their own. God can, theoretically, do exactly this. So, God should just force us to have knowledge of him because it is in our best interest. Or, if you don't like that proposal, he should perpetually reincarnate us until we finally gain knowledge of him on our own. 2) I completely agree that ""Freedom to accept"" is not a freedom unless you also have the ""freedom to reject."" But, ""freedom to reject"" does not imply that rejection must actually take place. If I give you a choice between getting a million dollars and one dollar as a gift from me, I can predict that every sane person will pick the million dollars -- It's just a better choice This fact does not imply that they did not have the freedom to choose the one dollar gift, it just implies that it was obvious to everyone that a million dollars was a lot better. I am suggesting that it is not logically contradictory that everyone could have ""freedom to reject"" but no one would choose it. God could just make the attractiveness of choosing him even better than the distinction between the million dollars and one dollar. Again, this argument is important because if a world where freedom to reject did not imply actual rejection could exist, then a morally perfect God would not create any other world. Also, I need to take you to task with the claim that non-existence is worse than Hell. First, I don't think we want to say that anyone, God or man, has an obligation to non-existent beings. If we did, then you and I are committing ‘non-existent person murder' by typing out these arguments instead of either getting someone pregnant or getting pregnant ourselves. Also, it seems to me that life could very easily be negative. If life is constant suffering, then you would be better off having not existed. 3) Your response is to claim that since God is defined by love and since forced love is not love, then God is not obligated to force people to love him. What occurs to me here is that this argument is going to hinge on the conclusion of the argument from 1b (we can just call it 1 now if you want). If God's love is a form other than romantic love then forced love is love and God should force us to love him. So, there's not point in debating this point further until we settle the 1b argument. 4) Ok, so it seems to me that your argument is that God is only fundamentally omnipotent and omniscient, but that he chose to bind himself to a definition of love and that this definition creates a world in which some people do go to Hell. Since God promised this to himself when he was amoral, it could not be an immoral promise. While I understand this response, once you start to think about it, it quickly becomes very confusing. I'm not entirely sure that God does exist temporally in the way you describe and I'm not sure that God was not morally perfect/ defined by love from the beginning, but, I really doubt that this can go anywhere other than senseless bickering over definitions of God. So, I'll drop it for now. CONCLUSION: in the interest of sticking to relevant debate topics and in sympathy to our dear readers, I have attempted to sideline argument 1a, 3 and 4 for various reasons and focus primarily on arguments 1b and 2. Thus, my position is essentially that even if God is defined by love, it is likely to be parental love which would allow God to intercede if we reject him because it would be in our best interest. Alternatively, I disagree with the implicit assumption in premise 4 of his formalization that ""To be fully-distinct, Individuals must be given the choice to reject God."" By saying that it is possible that God could create people with the possibility to reject God who rarely or never do it. This could be done by creating people who are rational and making it obvious that God is the most rational choice. Well, that's what I've got for now. I look forward to a response. Also, if any readers have feedback on my arguments please feel free to tell me!"	PRO	284

God loves you and He does not want you to go to Hell and neither do I. Because God loves you, He will allow you to reject Him. The loss you suffer in rejecting Him will be all of His comforts, and there is only one place where you can get what you deserve for rejecting His love and refusing to willfully give your Creator the honor and the glory He is due for creating you.

S39bab7b8-A6c10e0a4	The following users will probably go to hell because Christian theism is true.	"What we are arguing is the conclusion of the resolution, not the premises it rests on. Since the resolution contains the given statement that Christian Theism is true, and the actual contention is that the users will go to hell, an affirmation of the resolution affirms the contention, not the premises. In other words, since the instigator included this premise in the resolution, it is unarguable because it forms the framework for the debate. If my opponent wants to give up one of the premises his resolution rests on, it is the same as though the resolution had not been put forth at all - in which case the resolution defaults to the side of inaction - assuming the resolution is true. My opponent's resolution can be understood to be ""Given that Christian theism is true, the following users are probably going to hell."" The only way I see to negate this resolution is: The following users are probably NOT going to hell because Christian Theism is true. This negation makes no sense: The following users will probably go to hell because Christian Theism is false. And the double negation is a nonsensical statement: The following users will probably not go to hell because Christian Theism is false. This negation also makes no sense because it's self-verifyingly true, and cannot urge a change in the status quo, as is the instigator's burden.... ************************************************* So the only negation my opponent can really argue is: ""The following users are probably NOT going to hell because Christian Theism is true.""

""Hell"" within this debate is defined as ""The place of punishment described in the Christian religion"". 2. ""fault"" within this debate is defined as ""responsibility for a misfortune"". 3. ""responsibility"" within this debate is defined as ""Being accountable by virtue of having control over the outcome"" 3. ""is true"" within this debate is defined as ""has more predictive merit when compared with any mutually exclusive statement"" (A pragmatic theory of truth) So the statement that is the topic of the debate could also be stated like so: ""People enter the place of punishment described in the Christian religion without them having control over this outcome and therefor not being responsible for this misfortune."" is true. Background I am taking the position of Pro/for in this debate. I do not personally believe in the concept of hell because I deem it an unjust concept within the definition of justice provided by the Christian religion and I think this contradicts the concept of a loving and just god. Therefor I do not think the Christian religion is a correct model of reality. I will attempt to show that hell is an unjust concept because either trough determinism or a form of randomness people end up doing evil things beyond their control. All choices are made either because of prior causes or because of random events, neither are a good basis for condemning people to eternal punishment (or even temporary punishment). Opening statement People are not responsible for their actions. They are born with a certain set of personality, genes, disposition and resources (which they did not choose) and trust into a seemingly random situation (which they did not choose). They make choices in life influenced by those factors. Some would say those factors are the only factors people base their choices on. So let us take a murderer as an example. The person (let's name him Brian) chose to murder based on his personality (formed by his upbringing, etc) and the situation he was in at the time (formed by prior choices, his upbringing, etc) Neither of which he choose for ultimately based on choices he choose for himself. Some people would state that there is a true form of quantum randomness in the world (or even other forms of randomness) that also have an influence on the choices people make. If this is true than Brian is in no form controlling this randomness. So Brian has no control over the situation he is in (which includes his personality and the roll of the random quantum dice) and therefor has no control of his choice. Some people would state that Brian has a soul. And that soul has a free will. I do not personally believe in the soul, but lets state for this arguments sake that an undying soul exists. Why do some souls in Brian his situation choose to murder and other souls in that same situation choose to not murder? Do ""weak souls"" exist? Or ""evil souls""? And if so, what determines if a soul is weak or evil? If that is randomly determined it is not the control of Brian. And if Brian gets to choose his soul, with what personality, situation etc. is that choice made? Surely all those factors are beyond his control. My conclusion is that whatever factors influence the choice (personality, genes, upbringing, situation, quantum randomness, strength of the soul, etc) they are all beyond the control of Brian. Therefor Brian is not accountable because he has no control over the cause and thus no control over the outcome. If Brian is not accountable he is not responsible. And if he is not responsible he is not at fault and if he is ever thrown in hell for murdering it is not his fault that he got there."	PRO	288

S91b6b3a2-A87a55fd6	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"I'm sorry about the sudden font and size change of this round. I had a lot of trouble moving this from a word document. Defense of my Opening Argument I will agree with the way my opponent has summarized my argument, that being: P1. If you sin but do not believe, you go to hell when you die. P2. The unborn sin. P3. The unborn do not believe. C1. Therefore, the unborn go to hell when they die. ""You can probably already tell from my opening that I agree with Pro’s third premise"" My third premise has gone unchallenged. My opponent also argues that I did not validly support my first premise with John 3:16. He does not believe that the way I interpreted it is good enough to justify P1. I will give a few more passages that support the way I interpret John 3:16 as being correct. Romans 6:23 says, ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" Romans 2:6-8 says, ""God 'will repay each person according to what they have done.' To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. 8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger."" Mark 9:43 says, ""If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out."" 1 John 5:12 says, ""Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life."" John 3:36 says, ""Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them."" With all of these passages, it is clear that god sends sinners who have not accepted Jesus as their savior will go to hell. This affirms my interpretation of John 3:16 and defends P1. P2 is defended by simply looking at the concept of original sin. I have shown that original sin is Biblical whilst my opponent attempted to show that it wasn't. Please refer to these passages: 1) Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful from birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."" 2) Ephesians 2:2-3 https://www.biblegateway.com...... We were by nature deserving of wrath. 3) Genesis 8:21 https://www.biblegateway.com...... 4) Romans 3:23 ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god"" 5) James 1:15 ""Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."" Notice that death is a result of sin, hence aborted babies are sinners. 6) Isaiah 64:6 ""All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf,and like the wind our sins sweep us away."" We are all unclean, including babies. 7) Romans 3:20 ""Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin."" When we look at the god's law written in the Bible, nobody is righteous and we become conscious of our sin. With original sin being Biblical, aborted babies are sinful thus P2 is also defended. All three premises hold true. The conclusion I derived from the premises remains true. Thank you and good luck."	PRO	290

S33b32f5f-A398e966a	Is God real and is the Bible accurate	"Something that i can proudly say about myself is that i am happy to admit that i'm wrong. I can say that i was wrong about Jesus fasting for 40 day's point. I thought it said that he didn't eat or drink at all for 40 days. You say you studied the bible for years and know it doesn't contradict itself, but you have shown absolutely no evidence for proof in any of your arguments. Really, there is not one thing in this whole debate that tells me any reason that what you believe in is true. All you talk about is the bible. the bible is not evidence for god. The bible is a book and cannot be proven. Even if there is some historical truth to it. The story of the Trojan War was believed to be myth until the city of Troy was actually dug up. Just because Troy was found doesn't mean that Zeus is real. You cannot prove that Zeus isn't real but you don't just believe in something just because there is nothing disproving it. Even with Troy being real that shows nothing to prove that everything else in Mythology is real. That is a main reason that people don't believe in Greek and Roman Gods anymore. Lack of evidence. Although it is not proven it is more widely excepted that the original part of the bible was passed down orally. This is not fact, but it is the most likely case because of the fact that it would have been very difficult to write symbols on stone and pass them on. Because back in 1500 bc there was no written language yet. The bible is a very old book. Technology these days like apps and adobe flash have to be updated very often. Now this may not be true for the bible. The reason that the bible hasn't bee ""updated"" by god could be for only 3 reasons. 1. The bible is perfect and there is nothing wrong with it. 2. The bible has mistakes but we should just ignore those. 3. There is no God to change the mistakes/god does nothing to change these mistakes. the first one is really one of the main points of this debate. The bible being accurate and all. The bible like i have said is inaccurate in many different ways. You have decided not to answer most of them. Something you have to decide is whether of not the bible was inspired by man or god. 1 is saying that god told everyone exactly how to write the bible. If this is what you choose to believe then i ask you is how? I wait to see proof of this. 2 shows that you cannot trust the bible and the whole base for Christianity falls apart. 3 is all that's left You say that i don't want to look and listen, when that's all i do. I look for the answers and so far God isn't the one. Evolution is not an Atheist view, but it does hurt christian faith. Evolution shows that we did not come from Adam and Eve, and actually come from many many years of extremely small changes. Being able to breed dogs from wolves shows us that characteristics can be changed over time. Evolution is just a ""all-natural"" version of selective breeding. It shows that evolution is true and that in the very least that people weren't just placed here by god. I hear a lot that The Theory of Evolution is just that a theory. Well so is the Theory of Gravity and Gravity doesn't cause much argument. Evolution does because it contradicts the bible. That's the only reason. You say that you don't care weather or not I believe in what you say. Well if you're right i would think you would care about what i believe, because i would go to hell forever if i'm allowed to believe what i want. This is a direct quote from you: I had a freaind just like (caresless,ignorant,thought he could succeseed in life,) but he i a pitiful little man because he does listen to others (i mean accualy listen) because he thinks he knows it all and he doesn't he thinks hes a genius and hes not, he can not comprehend that God is an nessesity that he creatied man and NOT the other way around.

Being An Atheist means nothing about a person. There are bad Atheists and bad Christians. You don't know anything about me. I know i'm not a genius. I know I don't know everything. You think that God is a necessity. That shows that you are stuck believing in something without even trying think differently. You cannot comprehend that there might not even be a god. You need to question you faith. It your faith can be justified that you have no worries about questioning it. If it can't then you have no reason to believe in it.

We are judged independently of others. Babies do not sin. Judgement ""For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.""--Matthew 7:2 What measure of judgement do babies use? They do not judge. So this means that God, at the very least, does not judge babies. ""13 And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 15 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”""---Matthew 10:13-15 I have shown that, because babies don't sin and don't judge, they will not be thrown in Hell."

This is how you know you have won an arguement, when you use points irrelevant to the arguement My opponent claims that the key word is thought and therefore my theory is wrong however my opponent's theory is not even thought to be true. My theory is more plausible as well as likely since the most commonly used theory is the one presented by me. My opponent has not provided a source of anyone else genuinely believing his theory and he has not told me why his theory is right with any evidence unlike my arguments that were backed up with sources and evidence. My opponent states that this theory is come up by scientists to make them look smart. I'm almost certain that if there was a giant projector projecting a hologram of the moon then tell me why nobody has discovered this projector. It would be clear which direction the projection would coming from. You are asking me how the hell that I know that it isn't made up but really since the BoP is completely on my opponent I should be asking my opponent the same question.

Sf4081bc4-A4d03ee2a	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	I think before continuing, I would like to clarify the ground on which we are debating. I have conceded that we can debate using the Christian god, but I believe we should embrace the moderate interpretation of Christianity and of god, and not the extremes on either end of the spectrum. I suppose right now the argument being the word of god is secondary to most of the debate, but if necessary we can come back to it in the final round. My opponent has decided to debate about a minor portion of the topic. The simple reality is that even if he is to prove sending to hell those who have zero chance of being saved is not decent, I believe I will still win because the vast majority of people within this topic do have a choice to accept or reject god. Since it effectively conceded that it is just to punish these individuals, then I believe I have already proven a decent god can send to hell those who do not believe. Again, we must focus on everyone, and not simply a small portion of people. Having said this, for the sake of debate I will engage my oppoent on his arguments. As for the tribes argument, I would again like to point out this is a incredibly tiny portion of the population. And, with the spread of Christian missionaries across the world, there are few if any who no longer are aware of Christianity. If a tribe chooses to reject these missionaries, then it is right for them to face the consequences, which in this case is hell. Also, as stated earlier, if accepting Jesus and god is the only way to reach heaven, and if the tribe has not done this, then god is right to reject them. On the argument about people from other religions, some major religions are closely tied to Christianity, and by embracing the same god, they may still be saved. Having said this, free will solves back for this argument. Even if one is raised to follow one religion, they still have the ability to embrace Jesus. If they do not embrace the correct path to salvation and instead embrace a false belief, then god has no reason to save them or offer salvation since they had every chance to embrace the correct path. As for infants, while I can not say with absolute certainty, I am relatively certain that most sects of Christianity would send them to purgatory. I think reasonability factors into this, if Jesus washed away our sins, then infants and aborted fetuses who never had a chance to sin have no reason to be punished, meaning they would either go to purgatory or heaven. Only the most extreme sects of Christianity would argue otherwise, and we are not discussing those. My opponent contends that hell is an excessive punishment. But why? Those in question have rejected their creator, shown no gratitude, and lived a life detached from the road to salvation. Hell is a just punishment for those who did not seek salvation in life. God should not reward those who do not live a just life in service to him. Purgatory is also a potential destination for many in question, though I can not speak intelligently on who goes to hell and who goes to purgatory. To conclude I believe it is clear that not embracing salvation in life justifies punishment in death. I believe I am winning that nearly all people we are discussing in this debate are justly sent to hell because they have a choice. I also believe I have shown how those my opponent discusses are either not sent to hell or are sent to hell for just reasons.	CON	300

Oh and since you don not believe in God don't say OMG or when something good happens don't say thank you God. The Bible did not say that gays would be stoned to death. Not every teen is rebellious. For instance I am 19. I go to the food bank every Monday, I graduated, I wasn't suspended ever in school, I just got done with clinicals for Phlebotomy. Oh lets not forget I have a youth group every Wednesday. My friend he is a senior in high school and he is building him a house, does MMA, he is going in the national guard in July, he is going to college as soon as he gets back. Oh and as you say that our country is not built on God, then how do you explain the Pledge of Allegiance? Look at the money. God has sent signs that he is real. Too bad you don't have a bible cause then you could read it and see that everything that is happening in these days was predicted all that time ago. Think again at Noah's ark. Animals had to come from somewhere. Who is the first person in your family tree? In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" (John 1:1 NIV) Matter could not have always existed since, based on the second law of thermodynamics, if it did all the stars would have all burned out by now. Therefore, the existence of an eternal, all-powerful God is required as the 'first cause' of everything that exists. The 'Big Bang,' of itself, was not the first or initial cause of the material universe we see today. Rather, God's choice (as the first true 'cause') brought everything into existence using the Big Bang. How was grass, trees; etc made?

S5fcb7dea-A880a26ed	homosexuals going hell ? religion is a joke	"Let me begin my argument by first apologizing to my opponent for the apparent intolerance that he has witnessed through their lifetime in the name of religion, specifically Islam and Christianity. I will first support your argument by posting the following verses: JUDAISM ""[A man] shall not lie with another man as [he would] with a woman, it is a to'eva"" (Leviticus 18:22). CHRISTIANITY ""Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, 27 and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another"" (Romans 1:26-27) ISLAM ""We also sent Lut: He said to his people: Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you? For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds. And his people gave no answer but this: they said, ""Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"""" (Qur'an 7:80-82) KILLING GAYS? The above supports the argument that the three major faiths do agree on the premise that homosexuality is not a normal or moral way of life. However, of the three, only Judaism supports the execution of gays: ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them."" (Leviticus 20:13) Of course, this is not without contradiction: ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. ... For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the persons that do them shall be cut off from among their people."" (Leviticus 18:22,29) ON TO THE DEBATE My opponent's opening argument in this debate, as stated in the subject line is stated in a confusing way. But, what I take from it is that he does not support the notion that gays will go to hell, and that religion is a joke. Let's look at these two issues. WILL GAYS GO TO HELL? Islam is quiet on this issue, as is Judaism for all its support of executing or excommunicating gays. But, Christianity takes a stand in the following verse: ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."" (1 Cor 6:9-10 ) It can safely be assumed that since prior references in this argument state that homosexuality is a ""lust"" and a ""transgression"", it is considered ""sexual immorality"". Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven, as taught in Christian scriptures,cannot be inherited by a homosexual. IS RELIGION A JOKE? I don't think, especially from the experiences of my opponent, that religious people are joking at all. The issue of religion is a serious one, and a critical discussion for humans to have. The problem is that it becomes less of a dialogue and more dogma. Therefore, I conclude tha religion is, in no way, a joke. A SIDE NOTE I want to state clearly that I share the same disgust for intolerance of any sort. Although we are all at times intolerant of come ideals or concepts, it is only through discussion and debate that these things can be shared as human beings. May dialogues like this continue, regardless of the outcome of any single debate. ""why do some or ALL religions say or think gay people should be killed, we were created just like any other breathing person that way?"" They don't, brother. This is a general statement without basis. ""gay people are doctors, captains, engineers, teachers in every country from every religion they are in all high places, what is the point in ignoring the subject when i am sure that the very same people who still wont see gay people as normal humans also have siblings who want same sex marriage, be it man or women, it is just a gender matter,"" This has nothing to do with morality. You are appealing to subjective reasoning that can be argued from a number of angles. ""where is the sin in loving another man, or women loving a women (i dare any to argue)"" Where is the sin in loving your dog? Where is the sin in loving a woman who is not your wife? Where is the sin in loving little boys? Where does that end? Again, you are using very dangerous reasoning. ""go ask god why he made it that way oh wait, he didn't say, he remembered all the tiny details like don't have sex with women if you are not married or rape, don't drink beer, don't sing, don't draw, don't ..don't, don't... you get the point"" It is a different topic altogether to argue what it is that God has actually ever said Himself. ""i would believe in religion if those people had rights, but this has giving me reason to doubt the authenticity of religion and the system it works on"" Remember, you experiences are shaped by the religious expression of those around you. But, not all people express the same religion in the same way. There are Jews, Muslims, and Christians who accept homosexuals as their neighbor, regardless of what they think or believe of their actions. I am one of those. You don't have to accept everything a person you love does, and you should not only love people who are exactly like you."	CON	303
S781de01a-A4f206c21	"""People enter hell trough no fault of their own"" is true."	Thank you for accepting my apologies and being understanding about such situations. Control I stated that my opponent was correct that there are sometimes factors out of our personal control, but I did not make the statement that our lives are out of our control, because simply they are not. While situations granted to us may be out of our control, that does not make our actions out of our control. I brought up other individuals for the fact that situations are made by the choice we make to place ourselves around. Other individuals that are included in a situation are a direct result of the environment we place ourselves in. Sometimes we have no control over an event, because of the choices other people make. For example, the attacks of 9/11. Why does it seem I support my opponents side? I don’t. It’s just I can’t deny simple truth that in life there are events that we don’t have control over. I acknowledge this fact. HOWEVER, there WILL be events we have total control over. For instance, it is a choice to commit adultery. It is a choice to lust, It is a choice to break the Law of God. Why does every person face the threat of Hell? James 2:10-11 (NIV),”For whoever keeps the whole Law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said,’Do not commit adultery,’ also said,’Do not murder.’ If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.” What does this mean when we get judged one day (speaking theologically)? All Satan has to do is prove there was one point in our lives that we broke the Law and we deserve punishment for that transgression. It’s not about how many situations you’re in, It’s about that one situation that we chose to break God’s Law. But you see, this is not unjust, since then all of humanity would be condemned to Hell, since God provided a choice for those who believed that would cover not just that one sin, but all of them. Not just for the first transgression, but all of them, so a person would appear perfect before God because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the Cross. This is God’s love and character seen throughout the Bible (John 3:16). The Legal implications of such an actions come in Romans 5:19 (NIV),”For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.” Note: It says will be made, not ARE. That means they have the chance to be made, if they listen. All it takes is one. All it took was one. Simple. Thoughts and Souls I see my opponent throughout this debate has to “act as if those things exist”. In regards to the topic, I do not believe there is many ways to discuss this without bringing in the “possibility” of having souls. Anyways, I do not believe the supernatural controls our thoughts, for that would rule out free will, since we would be controlled. What I meant was that our thoughts themselves are “supernatural” in a sense since they have no real beginning. Yes, neurons fire off, but no one has any idea why neurons firing leads to the intricate information thought of in the mind, such as language, problem solving, and care for personal wellness and growth. I only wish to bring about the idea that our thoughts can be influenced supernaturally. Now, in your argument, you tell us to put ourselves in the shoes of God, who makes judgements. Hence, “God’s mighty judgement” (expressed at Sodom and Gomorrah, in Revelation, and throughout the Old Testament). I must express I am in no place to do such thing (for Judgement is God’s alone the Bible states), but for sake of the debate, I will enter into this argument. I see what you are saying about soul one and two, and I still see the idea of randomness. I hate to use the word, but I know that’s what you believe and I respect that. Let’s put this into the example though: Soul 1 had an interaction one time with Soul 2. Soul 1 spoke of God’s love, hope, justice, and purpose for Soul 2’s life, if Soul 2 would listen to the words of the Bible and to the love Soul 1 testified to. Soul 2 chose to ignore Soul 1, ignoring the purpose, love, hope, and justice so proclaimed, and chose to continue to live in darkness. In that interaction, Soul 2 decided with his/her will to ignore Soul 1, even if he offered peace. In that instance, Soul 2 had a chance. But Soul 2 chose to remain in darkness. You seem to believe that I believe that by our actions and good deeds are the only way to heaven. Ephesians 2:8-9(NIV),”For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith- and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God- not by works, so that no one can boast.” The biggest words in this are grace and faith, meaning it is by God’s grace through our (Christians) faith in him and choosing to live like Jesus did (Ephesians 5:1-2) so that we may spread his love and save those with the open arms of grace. Regardless, back to the souls. Maybe soul 1 would have done what soul 2 did, but what does that say about the missed opportunities of hope, love, and joy Soul 2 missed had he been in Soul 1’s shoes? Soul 2 chose, as seen in the interaction earlier, to stay in his darkness of dealing, or immorality, etc. Therefore, he missed his own salvation by choosing to ignore soul 1. So by the choice of choosing his darkness, soul 2 would be punished, but soul 1, had he/she lived their life for Jesus, as such books of James, Ephesians, Colossians, etc. say they are to live, and were truly repentant of their transgressions, they would receive paradise for their choice to listen to words of salvation. No one is born saved, everyone just has the chance to listen to it or not. By Soul 1’s faith, he would be saved from eternal damnation, which had Soul 2 chosen to had, he would experience as well. Prison vs. Hell revisited So, First off I would like to address that you seem a little confused about the role of Hell. I said that it was to permanently keep away transgressors by law abiders. By that I stand, but the reason theft and murder is not in heaven is because it has not been corrupted by evil. That is why there is a place for the righteous and a place for the transgressors. The reason to keep them away is so that there would not be murderers among men as there is here on Earth. Righteous with righteous, transgressor with transgressor, so that the paradise would not be corrupted. It is a paradise because it is pure. If you slide in the dirt with white pants on, you stain the pants brown. In the same way, you let darkness into light, and light disappears. Hell does not exist to punish just to punish, it is to keep the pure, pure. So dirt would not get into the seams and stain the white. Now, some “previous murderers” probably do “end up” in heaven. Why? That’s so unjust right? There’s this thing in Christianity, and it’s called being “born again” and when this feeling is described in the book of Acts, it is described of having a new heart with new desires. It’s a very complicated matter, and basically means that that the person no longer purposefully goes on and transgresses the law, but lives a righteous life by the Bible. They are “born again”, or in better words, they have a new identity in Christ. They are not who they were. They knew their actions were wrong, and repented of their evil ways. They live to not be the people, and they often share their stories of coming from the evils of their life to light in “testimonies”. It’s truly a deep subject. And to simply answer your question, some people listen because they need a purpose, they need hope, they need love, and others do not because of their love for “darkness”. Many do not listen because they are satisfied with immorality, murder, lust, etc. Conclusion- Unfortunately, this topic requires more space than what is given. Just like how this debate ends, with a vote on your choice of who wins, it is your choice to listen. It’s in your control this time. Thank you for this, I would say more, but I’m out of space	CON	304
S781de01a-A614244f	"""People enter hell trough no fault of their own"" is true."	Background- I am taking the con/against side for this debate, and personally, I do believe that there is a real concept of heaven and hell, and I believe that the definition of justice provided by the Christian religion does not contradict the idea of a loving and just God, unlike my opponent. Through this debate, I will try to provide a non-theological and pragmatic argument; however, in reference to the basic idea of the nature of the Christian God, and other such points, I will go to a more theological argument. Opening Statement- I would like to start off by stating that I understand the axioms provided and will try to use these words as defined. First, I understand that you are using the idea of “randomness” and all of these things are just taking place by chance and that people are by chance doing “evil things beyond their control”. By this, it is my understanding that you mean things like deaths, births, car accidents, etc. I would like to take out the word “randomness” from this argument because of a theory called Causal determinism, which is the theory that every event has a cause. If there is a cause for the event, and effects are found after it, then nothing is really “random” because something had to cause it. By definition, “random” means proceeding, made or occurring without definite aim, reason, or pattern (Dictionary.com). Nothing proceeds as “random” because of how life proceeds on after events happen, when something had to happen for the event to occur. For example, a car accident. If a car got T-boned leaving a driveway, a cause for the crash could be a driver forgot to look back at the oncoming lane before merging into traffic, and so an oncoming driver could not stop in time and hit the other driver due to his error of pulling out in front of him when he forgot to look back at the oncoming lane. Therefore, let’s be cautious when using the word. So, with this in mind, I believe people are responsible for their actions. We, as human beings, have free will to do what we want, when we want, if we so chose to do so. One may respond, but what about the law? And in that, I would say you don’t have to follow it if you didn’t want to. However, if you break the law, you will face the punishment, or justice will be served, due to your transgression. Let’s look at the Christian Religion for a second. In the Bible, the compilation of books (the Bible is not a traditional book with chapters, but a compilation of 66 books written by 40 authors, on 3 continents over a span of 1,500 years all basically telling the same story of God’s love, God’s law, what happened to the transgressors of said law, and the story of Jesus and his place in God’s “plan”. Look it up) that the Christian religion uses as the basis for its organization and beliefs, is a set of laws that Christians follow. “Evildoers” are people who break this law, and are thrown into hell for their transgressions. But those who believe in Jesus and repent of their “sin” (a transgression of divine law [Dictionary.com]) will be saved and go to heaven. This is just the basis of the Christian religion, I will tie this back in soon. So, just as a person is thrown in prison for their transgression of our law in America, people are thrown into hell for their transgression against God’s law. Now to argue his point, as I said earlier, people have free will. My opponent makes the point of “All choices are made because of prior cause…”. I would like to say that while a person might not be able to control events, as people are born into certain circumstances, it IS our choice on how to deal with a situation. So to use your example, if Brian killed someone because his father did, and many of his friends also had killed someone, and he was violent because he had been a drug dealer at a point in his life, then according to your argument, the law doesn’t quite matter due to “randomness”, and no justice should be served for Brian because his upbringing was rough. I like to think of myself as a logical person, and I have to say, this is quite absurd. I’ll go through by situation. His father killed someone, did he take that as normal? More importantly, did he learn that since his father was imprisoned for his murder, did he not see that there was a consequence for his action? That his father’s action was wrong and against the law? What about his friends? We choose our friends, do we not? If you hang with a bunch of murderers by choice, and you end up killing someone with them or because they did too, is it not your fault you chose to hang by those people? And what about the drug dealing? Maybe Brian picked it up from his friend or his father. Did he choose to be a drug dealer? Yes. He saw the money they were making and he knew it was illegal (every dealer does, drugs aren’t sold in broad daylight illegally) and yet proceeded to transgress the law for personal gain. And finally, in the murder situation itself. Killing comes from a hatred or want for personal gain, hence why the motives are usually overreaction to an event, or a chance to cash in on life insurance. Does this sound “random” to you? You choose to respond to different situations. For example, I saw this debate and chose to respond over others on the same topic. Is it “random” that I chose to take the time to respond to this? No. It was out of my own free will that I chose to respond to this. Now, on the issue of souls. I believe we have them, and I believe it is our consciousness. Out of our consciousness and awareness to our surroundings, we have the will to react in certain ways. Hence, free will. Relationships of any kind are built on free will, since you must choose the other person or living creature and be nice or mean and they must choose you to be nice or mean, to build a good or bad relationship with each other. As asked by my opponent, “Why do some souls in Brian his situation choose to murder and other souls in that same situation choose to not murder?”. I would have to answer that by using your own evidence. People have different morals based on their upbringings, personality, genes, situation etc. and so they choose with their free will to act differently based on their current situation. Now, what about the law? The law is established and is the same all around that particular area. Same with God’s law. It is established. If you break it, punishment, if you are pardoned by Jesus (Christians believe in the Trinity, or God in 3 parts, God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit (which is basically part of God sent to Christians and lives within them, and with this spirit, they live out the Bible and its ways, regardless of how well they choose to do so), you receive eternal life. Souls in humans are not necessarily different, everyone has one, it’s just what a person believes in the consciousness and free will. It is not the strength of the soul, but rather the reaction to uncontrollable events in our lives (which are controlled events in other people’s lives, based on their choices and reactions to previous situations) that determines the outcome of an event. As humans, we learn by experience to such events, which end up shaping who we are. So, our reaction to events (our experiences) with our free will changes our morals. Different experiences bring different morals, which cause some to murder and others to not. So, technically, these “factors” of Brian, are really all in his control based on his reaction to his earlier and current experiences. So, in conclusion, in terms of Brian, he IS accountable for his deeds because of the way he chose to respond to previous events. If he is ever thrown into hell, it is because in that moment he chose to transgress God’s law(which is like any law, if you break it, you break it), which is what the decision of what life or death comes to in Christianity. By his choices, he would be cast into hell for breaking God’s law, just as he would be thrown into jail for breaking the law here.	CON	305
S90bab8b7-A240b9b23	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	"A.The Killings of God Thank you Pro! 1. (Exodus 22:18 NAB) (1)Sorceress, as you should know, don't exist and if they did why put them here in the first place if you just wanted people to kill them. If there had been no witches, such a law as this had never been made. The existence of the law suggest the existence of the thing. Even if witches did not exist then that leaves this law as killing no one because there is no witch. In every form of witchcraft there is an appeal to a power not acting in subordination to the divine law of God. The practice of witchcraft was therefore an act of rebellion against God.[1] 2. (2 Kings 2:23-24 NAB) (2)Killing children for name calling is, for any sane people, completely over punishment. Perhaps it was necessary to show, at the outset of his career as a prophet, that he too, so mild and peaceful could, like Elijah, wield the terrors of God's judgments ( 1 Kings 19:19 note). The persons really punished were, not so much the children, as the wicked parents 2 Kings 2:23, whose mouth-pieces the children were, and who justly lost the gift of offspring of which they had shown themselves unworthy.[2] 3. (Isaiah 14:21 NAB) (3) This is unfair to the child which has no control over what there parents do. Besides, since every father has ""guilt"", doesn't that mean everyone should just drop dead? This command seems to be directed to the Medes and Persians, and denotes that they would thus cut off his children. For the iniquity of their fathers - On account of the crimes of their ancestors - the pride, haughtiness, and oppression of the kings of Babylon. This is the statement of a general principle of the divine administration, that the consequences of crime often pass over from the perpetrator, and impinge on his descendants (see Exodus 20:5).[3] My opponent still did not show us that Israel as Gods people did not have the right to kill. She gives us a verse from the N.T. but this topic is in the O.T. which has significant differences. Before Jesus Christ and His ministry the Israelites were God's people and it was they who God used to punish other nations. As so other nations punished them for turning away from God. God did not create man with the knowledge to sin or intended it. Therefore once man sinned against God, then God, had every right to destroy His creations. Also God did not destroy man by the flood for just sinning but because angels came and were manipulating mans seed with theirs. As we see it was very much just to kill all people because they were tainted by angels except Noah who was perfect in his generations. Also my opponents opinion of what she would do helps us none in determining if God is just or unjust. B.God Endorsed Slavery My opponent has yet to show that God endorsed slavery but instead regulated it amongst His people. My opponent also suggest that murder and slavery are the same crime. One ends life forever and one doesn't. It is agreed that the bad effects out-weighed the good effects in slavery. None of this shows God endorsed slavery but that men started slavery for superiority issues. C.God is not just, nor does He have a heart 1. Who controls everything? I again challenge my opponent to show that God controls everything and that individuals do not control themselves. 2. Who made Hell? God does not throw out disobedient angels or men. They chose to separate themselves from him. The choice to oppose God is the very essence of hell. For humans this choice is made at death. What this means is that God did not create hell, he only allows for its possibility as a consequence of his choice to give angels and humans the gift of free will. 3. Who made criteria that I must meet to go to Heaven? God did. 4. Heart My opponent keeps inserting how she feels and what she views as if everything evolves around her opinion. My opponent also wants God to allow His creations to do their own will without punishment. I can say that Jesus Christ showed alot of compassion, forgiveness and empathy. We can find many instances of these same traits throughout the O.T. and N.T. We see spoken throughout scripture from God to man. My opponent ignores the vast amounts of hints of what to do and God's kindness to allow us to try again. What my opponent wants is eternal chances to try again and accept there is consequences. D.What's The Point of Hell? My opponent is still confused about the purpose and reason for hell. Hell is not made by God but those who choose to be without God. This is not punishment but freedom to be without God so therefore God has no need to teach any further. Because the description of hell through the Bible makes people think it is punishment but instead it is freedom to those who want to be without God. Your life and heart is all that is needed to know were your place is. I can not help if my opponent does not believe in hell to be scared about it but for those that do it is very much a reason not to sin. My opponent is committing a fallacy to assume that because she does not believe in God that she shouldn't be without God(or in hell) but that is incorrect. Sources: [1] http://bible.cc...

I am going to argue that there is evidence to support an historical Jesus and also offer some arguments based on logical connections to show that Jesus was a living person that inspired a religion. Currently the other part of the resolution ""Christianity is not real"" is a very vague statement, because even if the core idea of the Religion wasn't real, it's an existing religion with followers that exist.

My opponent repeatedly ignoring the agreement he subscribed to by accepting the challenge to argue from the position of ""I have to burn in Hell"" 2) My opponent trying to put many words in my mouth to change my position and argue the pro position instead of taking the con Poseidon. My opponent has completely failed to refute the assertion of the debate which I uphold, ""You don't have to burn in Hell, you can be saved from it"" The reason you do not have to burn in Hell is that you can be saved from it. If you are not saved from it, you will have to burn in Hell. My opponent continues to put many words in my mouth implying I said things I never said, then uses my own arguments which would support my own position so I cannot disagree with his statements on the penalty of Hell attached to sin and the Bible references supporting the doctrine. Until your death is finalized, it is possible for you to be saved from burning in Hell. My opponent never argued from the Con position in this debate. My opponent never refuted any of my statements, but rather tried to change the meaning of my statements to put me in a position contrary to the pro position while he used arguments supporting my resolution. You have to burn in Hell if you are not saved from it. You don't have to burn in Hell, you can be saved from it. My opponent deserves no points in this debate as he made no arguments against the resolution other than trying to change the meaning of words and put words in my mouth as he usurped the pro position in the debate. The only thing good I hope comes out of this is that at least one person will consider the importance of knowing that your sins are forgiven and you are going to heaven, and they get the matter settled with God. Binding Contract: I, God, do hereby swear by the blood of my Son, Jesus, to overlook all of your violations of my Holy Law (sin) and grant you full pardon and entrance into eternal life by the resurrection of my Son from the dead if you will agree to the following terms: 1) You must acknowledge that you are the one who deserved to die and my Son did not deserve to die. 2) You must believe that I love you so much that I died in your place in the form of Jesus Christ my Son, and you must believe that I raised Him from the dead and can do the same for you. 3) You must ask me to accept you on these terms, asking for my mercy to forgive you and believe that I am willing to forgive you. You must receive my Son, Jesus, as your Saviour by asking me in His name to save you. This contract is written by me in the blood of my Son whom I gave to be the satisfaction for payment for your sins against me. If you honestly agree to the terms above, and will receive my Son as your Saviour, sign below.

Sf4081bc4-A5a8b26c9	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	"I would like to apologize for the wait I have just recently woken up. I would also like to thank my opponent for this is also my first debate on the site. I believe I did mention that god supposedly gave us the bible although I believe it would be a lot easier to believe in it if God himself had come to earth and written it in front of a large amount of people. However the bible was written by humans which does not mean that it can not be true however it does mean that there is a good chance that it could not be true. I would like to not go deep into that however because that is an entirely different debate. My opponent states that god offers a direct path and method to reach him but despite that I believe it is wrong to send someone to hell merely for not believing in him. ""My opponents next point is that hell should not be created in the first place. When one really thinks through the concept of hell, one clearly sees its purpose and necessity of it, If man has free will, he has a choose to good or evil. If man believes that there is only a good place to go when he dies (heaven), then what incentive does man have to do good. Hell exists so man has an incentive to do good. God would hope that man does good, but if man does bad, then why reward that person?"" I would like to debate this by pointing out that we are not talking about whether a person is good or bad. I would like to throw out an example. Right now despite how insanely large Christianity is picture for a second you are in a place where people are somewhat cut off from the world. People are raised and live then die full lives in tribes where nobody has even heard about god. They have never had a chance to believe in God because nobody has told them that he exist.. and yet according to the bible no matter how good or bad these people were they will be spending eternity in hell because there was no way for them to be saved. What about people from other religions? Many of them are raised to believe in other things because other holy books and people tell them to believe in things other than the Christian god. Because of the amount of religions out there it really is hard to believe that Christianity is correct and they will go to hell for believing in the wrong thing. I would like to give another example. I am not saying all Christians believe in original sin but many do. From the glossary in the Catechism: Original Sin: ""The sin by which the first human beings disobeyed the commandments of God,...Besides the personal sin of Adam and Eve, original sin describes the fallen state of human nature which affects every person born into the world, and from which Christ, the ""new Adam,"" came to redeem us. "" More from the Catechism: CCC 407 The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of the redemption by Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation and activity in the world. By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free.... Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social actions and morals. So according to original sin this means that basically until you do something to be saved you are a sinner and will go to hell. By these rules all of the babies who suffer from crib death and haven't been saved will go to hell. Wouldn't people who get aborted also go to hell? My point is that if a person is killed before they can be saved then according to the rules they get punished for something they had no control over which is not right. My opponent then goes on to mention that if one has ""rejected"" the only path to forgiveness then God is justified in sending them to hell. I would like to point out two things. First, since we are talking about people who do not believe in God I have decided to focus on those who have 0% chance to be saved. They have not rejected God but instead have never been given a chance to know God. God has created people and set them up to have no chance which is not right. Second I would like to point out that being sent to hell is no light punishment. Being tortured for eternity is insane for ANY crime you could commit down here. People have debates over whether the death penalty is a good or bad idea and mere death is nothing compared to eternal torture. Eternity is a very very long time and it is really difficult for me to believe a loving god could do that to any of his creations much less the ones who do not or can not believe in him."	PRO	314

Because God caused them to come into existence He has no right to punish them for being the imperfect creatures they were born as. They are wrong. God proved His right to punish them by becoming a man like them and paying their penalty in death. Because He is God and had no sin of His own to pay for, death could not hold Him. He shed his blood so that He can overlook my sin (and yours if you are in agreement with Him) because eternal burning in Hell can never take away my sin.....He ook my sin away when He became sin for me and took my death. I am justifed in His resurrection through faith in His blood. The only other way for my existence to be justified would be in the fire of Hell where all who are turned against God belong. Many religious people think they gain the right to eternal life, paradise, heaven, or Nirvana by the things they do such as acts of altruism or by following a code of conduct to display honorable character. This is the way of Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism and all of it's offshoots such as Buddism and Bhai (which mingles Islam and Hinduism), Mormonism, Satanism and all of it's offshoots such as Wicca and parapsychology, Paganism, Judaism, Seventh Day Adventism, and any others which are less known and more easily forgotten. All religions focus on what you can do to attain eternal life in whatever mode or state is taught by that religion. Atheism, the religion of anti-religion, teaches that your eternity is void of pain or pleasure, so in atheism you live for the moment as your eternity. Atheism is the most bankrupt of religions, and Satanism is the most evil. All religions are evil and bankrupt, some more so than others. Jesus Christ is a person through whom you can know God personally. You can know that you have eternal life now and your sins are forgiven now and forever if you A) Admit that you deserve to die now and burn in Hell forever as a sinner who is turned against God. B) Believe God loves you and does not want you to burn in Hell, so He Himself paid for your sin with His own blood as The Son of God, and rose from the grave bodily so you can be free now from the penalty of Hell which is given against sin. C) Call on God in the name of the One who paid for your sins with His blood, Jesus Christ, to save you. No priest, Pope, or religious lifestyle can get you to heaven or buy favor from God. God will never owe you anything no matter how much you give to other people even if you say you are doing it in God's name. The only thing that can justify your life is the blood of Jesus Christ. The only thing that can justify your death is the fire of Hell which is the end of sinners if they reject God's offer of pardon for their sins based on the fact that He paid in full for them with His own blood in Jesus Christ. My opponent has stated ""As a Catholic I would argue that we are indeed justified by faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice on the cross, but that this alone does not cut it, as we need to cooperate with Grace through works. If it is this that you are defending I would gladly take the side of the Council of Trent, if what you are debating is whether or not we deserve hell if we were not redemed by Our Lord then I will not argue with you, as I agree wholeheartedly. My answer to this is that if you are not redeemed now, you are not redeemed forever. Redeemed means the price was paid to satisfy a debt to buy back a piece of property. My debt was paid by God Himself to buy me back from Hell. I am redeemed now, I am saved now, I have eternal life now, I am forgiven now. For this debate, I am not interested in the Council of Trent. That has to do with church history. This is not a church history debate. This is a philosophy debate about how you justify your existence outside of the fire of Hell. How are you justified?

Se409bef7-A33d75329	You deserve to burn in hell; the same as me.	Death is separation from God caused by sin. Sin is the breaking of God's law, (the Ten Commandments, if you have ever lied, stolen, even in the tiniest way, you have broken God's law.........sin is an English word, easily defined..........if the law is just, breaking the law is sin.....even if you reject God, you are still a lawbreaker and deserve to be punished by the law......the law is good for nothing if breaking the law does not bring punishment. God does not want His creatures to be imprisoned forever, but He cannot allow rebellion against Him by His creatures to go unpunished..........lest the rebellion spead to all of His creatures and then all would have to be negated (un-created) or confined where God will have no pleasure in the beings He created to enjoy. Why would God want to forever go through the heartache of wathing His creatures causing more and more problems for themselves and those around them by the things they do wrong? There must be an end, a total and unchangable eternal separation between God and those who rebelled against Him or everything God created would be a continuing battle between those who say He is wrong to enforce His law, and His law is bad (restricive, selfish, didctatorial) and those who say His law is good and He is good (protecive, loving, king, righteous, just, perfect, worthy of all praise and all worship from His creatures.)

S5ba5941b-A1e656d15	Presupposing Islam is true, an eternal hell is justified.	"C1: Status and Morality I. I would first like to admit that I made a mistake in the first contention of my opening statement. I agree with Con's moral principle that every person has equal moral worth. My premise is that the severity of a sin is based on the status of the being it is being directed towards. I gave a poor example to illustrate this which was: >> “It would be considered much more immoral to harm or kill a highly respected member of society rather than the common man” I would like both Con and the audience to dismiss that example and accept the other one in which I said: >> “Surely, the immorality felt by killing an ant or a fly is much different than that of another human since the status of the human is higher than that of the ant or fly.” Note that Con didn't address this example at all but focused on the other one. The source by which my whole argument is based on pointed out that since human beings despite having different social statuses would have the same intrinsic moral status because they are of the same natural kind. It states: ""Other things being equal, killing a saint’s best friend seems no worse than killing a criminal’s, even though the saint would arguably enjoy a higher social status. On the other hand, this may not be a genuine counterexample to the first premise, because saints and criminals are both of the same natural kind (humanity);” [1] II. Con says that my contention is in part based on social status which has already been addressed above. I agree that the seriousness of the punishment is also based upon the seriousness of the sin, this isn't very controversial. Con gives an example of stealing a candy and a nephew and doesn't elucidate on what he is trying to illustrate or show. Con then says that stealing a candy and murdering 26 people would both merit an infinite punishment since it is against Allah. He thinks that this is a refutation but isn't, this is what my argument proves. I would like to formalize it in a syllogism to be more clearer. “(4) Other things being equal, the seriousness of a crime increases as the status (the degree of importance or value) of its victim increases. (5) God has an infinitely high status. (6) Therefore, crimes against God are infinitely serious (from (4) and (5)). (7) All sin is a crime against God. (8) Therefore, all sin is infinitely serious (from (6) and (7)). (9) The more serious a crime is, the more serious its punishment should be. (10) Therefore, all sin should receive an infinitely serious punishment (from (8) and (9))” [1] Any sin against Allah merits an infinite punishment since Allah has an infinitely high status. Con didn't refute the argument, he just listed what the argument proves. III. Con gives an example of two varying degrees of wrongs done and says that my argument would say that each is the same. This is false, my argument brings into account the seriousness of the crime and the status of the individual. These are two factors not only one. In Con's example, both are people meaning they have the same moral status. The punch in the face would indeed be more immoral than the hard shrug against both people. (However, taking in to account that it is indirectly sin against Allah they would both would be infinitely immoral against Allah) C2: Consequences of Sin I. Con's response to my second contention is severely lacking and doesn't really address my contention. It mostly focuses on my third contention. If we apply Con's response to my second contention, Con claims that we are so psychologically limited and ignorant that it isn't our fault if we commit major sins such as rape or murder. While I do believe that we are limited and ignorant, I don't think we are so limited that we cannot avoid these major crimes that impact souls eternally. Con is underestimating human beings too much. C3: Free Will I. Con claims that we don't have sufficient cognitive faculties to be able to know how truly horrifying the punishment of hell fire is and tries to illustrate this using an irrelevant example. For one, I do think we can have sufficient knowledge of how truly horrifying the nature of hell is. Here is an example which outlines the duration of hell fire, I would like the audience as well as Con to put this into perspective: “(They will abide therein for ages) they will abide in the Fire for ages and ages, each age consisting of 80 years, each year being 360 days and each day is the equivalent of 1,000 years of the years of the life of the world; it is also said that none knows the exact duration of these ages save Allah, and therefore these ages are never interrupted.” [2] This example only illustrates the length of hell fire, imagine if one were to give descriptions of the actual torment. What I think Con is trying to subtly imply is that since we haven't experienced hell fire, we cannot know how truly terrible it is which is false. Simply because one hasn't experienced a certain thing doesn't mean he cannot know that it is bad. No one will say that suicide isn't immoral because we haven't experienced it. II. Con gives an example of a direct choice of going to hell fire. Con talks about a young boy who purposely puts his hand into a fire, but as I explained in my opening statement I said that freely choosing to go to hell is an indirect choice not a direct one. It is a consequence of freely rejecting the teachings of Islam. III. Con says that why couldn't Allah be more merciful and overwrite some of our choices. The fact is that Allah wants true and sincere followers of his to enter paradise. In order for this to be the case, he must test them. Even though all Muslims enter paradise by the mercy of Allah and not on their own accord, what brings forth this mercy? It is wilful obedience to Allah and genuine sincerity and constant repentance that will foster Allah's mercy. How can you receive mercy if you do not ask for it? - - - - Con's objections were answered. He has hardly touched my second contention which is essentially extended.

S8b459969-A300f8cb9	If you are not saved and going to Heaven, you are lost and sliding down to Hell.	Well, technically speaking, we are all dying. Every day that passes is a day closer to death. Nobody can beat death. However, I would consider myself to be in fairly good shape, especially for my age. If by the fire of hell, which presumably is underneath the earth's crust somewhere, you mean global warming, I am certainly feeling the effects of it. All this being said, god has nothing to do with it. I don't feel like I am lost. I am actually very aware of my current location and if I forgot for some reason, I could just use the GPS on my phone to figure out where I am. Even if I was about to die, who are you to say that I would not be going to heaven if such a place exists? I don't need the fear of the punishment of hell to be a good, moral person. Perhaps the same isn't for you. If you could, please provide a bit of evidence that heaven, hell, and god exist. If you cannot do this, I will not be able to fear them.

If you claim to say that every person in this world that has ever lived, is a sinner, then that means that Jesus is a sinner too. If Jesus is very special because he died for our sins (although, that can be debatable based on historical records), then what about other people who died for us? Why aren't they treated like Jesus? Based on your statements, everyone is a sinner. Then that means Jesus is a sinner too. In fact, Jesus was also a drunkard.(Matthew 11:19). If Jesus is no different than us, and he died for us (making people worship him), then what about the millions of soldiers, and historical figures such as Gandhi? They are also sinners like Jesus, but they also died for the sake of their people. I am assuming that you believe Jesus didn't get sent to hell. Then what makes others so different than Jesus?

S90bab8b7-Aedeaeb89	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	I appreciate my opponents direction of her links but I did see them. A.The Killings of God NOTE: I gave the very clear instruction for my opponent to choose three specific verses for us to debate about here but she did not do this. The reason this is necessary is because we have character limits and only four rounds to fully discuss this topic of 'God killing people.' We have no room to discuss a plethora of examples and common practice in debates is to choose a few topics to discuss not a plethora of them. It gives a unfair burden on myself to fulfill and many experienced debaters here will see what I am saying. Regardless I will go about this section in a manner of just talking about God's supposed killing of humans in a whole. First off, can someone destroy what they make if it does not do what they made it for? If someone creates something can the creation ever be equal to the creator? And Would the creator be held in any immoral action if He destroyed what is His? The point is God is not held to the same standard as humans place on themselves. God flooded the earth and destroyed everything but sets of everything but is God held to being called a killer? He created the earth and man and therefore can flood the earth and drown man. My opponent should just show how God is held to the same standard as man. God told His people to kill others. The Bible clearly says that the price of sin is blood or death. This the reason for sacrifice, to cleanse the sin, and why Jesus came and a God was sacrificed for all. We no longer need to sacrifice or to follow old law because Jesus fulfilled it for all-time. The Bible gives the reason why these people are killed and there is more then one instance. They were killers, rapist, slave drivers, village raiders and generally terrible people. This goes into the next section about slavery also. God gave instruction for slavery because of people like these took everyone they could as slaves. My opponent needs to show people that God and Israel had no right to kill. B.God Endorsed Slavery My opponent continued on in this section without addressing my comments in Round 1. God never made slaves or slavery and my opponent has the burden of showing He did. We will never find in the Bible that God started slavery. I will refer back to my last rounds comments and say that slavery was around in that time and Israel was exposed to it. God simply gave instructions to His people on a societal norm which was slavery. I guess my opponents is saying that God should stop slavery because it is wrong but then He should stop everything then, right? He should stop you from doing that thing that your parents did not want you to do back then, right? By taking away humans choice to make slaves takes away freedom of decision and that is truly wrong. Furthermore my opponent needs to show that slavery is the harmful in all circumstances. There is no doubt instances of slavery that are harmful but there are also instances of slavery that is helpful. Is the situation of a person who is homeless, starving and clothless but free somehow better than being a slave with a home, food and clothes? No it is not. Slavery is not a word with a meaning that is all negative. Are we to make the claim that all slaves actually did not choose to live, love and serve their masters? Is all masters bad? Is not government and law our masters? C.God is not just, nor does He have a heart My opponent has obvious flaws in her understanding of scripture and the person and God in Jesus Christ. She also totally drops her scripture from last round therefore conceding it was not Biblical. According to the New Testament one can not fully live morally without Jesus Christ and therefore it is most important to find Jesus Christ and a higher moral living will follow through Him. It is also each person's decision if they go to heaven or hell, not Jesus' or God's. My opponent also needs to explain this section here much further. Are we searching for a heart like humans? Is God supposed to have a pumping heart like humans? Is he supposed to view us as His equal and our deaths make Him a murderer? Is He not free to destroy His creations that do not do what He created them for? D.What's The Point of Hell? As I said last round, hell, is just a description of what eternity without God will be like. I think we can agree that everything we do has consequences in life. We often see consequences as punishment as we see hell as punishment. In fact consequences and punishment is the expression of freedom. When we freely choose to do something then a consequence will result. This therefore is the point of hell. Hell is for people who do not want to worship God as God, people who are selfish and chooses to rather live without God's righteousness. Therefore the description of burning and lake of fire is what this area outside of God will be like. I do not know the point of this section as well, is it for just explaining hell?	CON	331
Sedfad01e-A873d2228	The Problem of Evil and Hell	I accept. God Since this debate focuses on God as revealed in the Holy Bible, I think it's prudent to ascribe to Him all the same characteristics the Bible ascribes to Him. The Westminster Confession of Faith does a great job of this: There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions; immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of His own immutable and most righteous will, for His own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him; and withal, most just, and terrible in His judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty. God has all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of Himself; and is alone in and unto Himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which He has made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting His own glory in, by, unto, and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and has most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever Himself pleases. In His sight all things are open and manifest, His knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to Him contingent, or uncertain. He is most holy in all His counsels, in all His works, and in all His commands. To Him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience He is pleased to require of them. In the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son.

In my sources I not only give more than what is asked, but I also give a graph that counted the amount of people killed by God. B.God Endorsed Slavery God basically says that you can beat and own people as long as they're not your race, which in this case was Israelites.

There is pleasure in sin for a season, you can steal a car if you want to and God does not stop you first, but for me, no thank you. Nobody has a license to sin. You can enjoy sin if you want to all the way to the fire of Hell. I will take sides with God against my sin, and that is in every thought and imagination as much as I can handle confessing to without dropping dead. It is by God's mercy that I am not consumed. Even while I pursue holiness and do my best to put sin away from my life, I still fall short and deserve to die and burn in Hell. God would have every right to end my time here at any moment, the same as He holds that right over you. The difference with me and you is that I have agreed with God that my sin is worthy of death and Hell. You are taking for granted that you have the right to sin however you feel like it. I entered into agreement with God agaisnt my sin and got saved from the fire of Hell when I saw that I was lost and had no right to live due to the fact that I have broken God's law. All have sinned. All deserve to die and burn in hell. All can be saved from it. As long as death has not finally taken you into eternity, you can be saved from Hell. Will you be saved?

You must receive my Son, Jesus, as your Saviour by asking me in His name to save you.

S9958d011-Ad5566ba3	Christianity is not real.	"I will have to be quick due to limited time, so I thank Con for his arguments. I will now state my rebuttals. 1. Flavius Josephus and his claim about Christ. [1] Flavius Josephus was not born until 37 CE (AD), which is four years after Christ supposedly died. Therefore there is no way he could have witnessed any part of Christ's life at all. Also, if this isn't convincing enough, Josephus' writings could have easily been forged, especially since it was such a long time ago. They were also kept by the Church, which could have made them say anything they wanted to. 2. Tacitus and his claim about Christ [2] Tacitus made a claim about Christ as well and described him, but just like Josephus, there is no way he could have known what he was like if he didn't exist at the time Jesus was supposedly alive. Also, why is it that no one quoted Tacitus' passage as a source for their writing until the fifth century CE? If it was so amazing that he had somehow 'seen' Jesus, wouldn't he be more well known? Wouldn't his writings also be more well known? Now I will move onto my point. Jesus has said way too many contradictions and 'ungodly' things in the Bible to believe that it is true. 1. Love your enemies as you love yourself. [3] In Luke 6:26, Jesus said: ""But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you."" So here, he is preaching forgiveness, correct? And he is saying even if someone does something bad, he should be forgiven, right? So why does he say this in Mark 16:15-16? ""He said to them, ""Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned [to hell]."""" This is how Jesus himself says he will treat his enemies. If he is telling other people to forgive and love their enemies, why doesn't he? Right here it says that he will send them all to hell. Obviously a loving and caring god would recognise that some people may not believe in him and that is not their faults because they grew up learning different things. If Jesus holds that against them, when it is absolutely not their fault, I cannot see how he is perceived as the 'saviour of the world.' 2. Racism from Jesus? [3] If Jesus is god, then he should love all his people, no matter what, right? So why does Jesus say this, in Matthew 15:22-26? ""A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, ""Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."" Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, ""Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."" He answered, ""I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."" The woman came and knelt before him. ""Lord, help me!"" she said. He replied, ""It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."""" Right here in this passage, Jesus is discriminating against a 'Canaanite woman.' Jesus is supposed to cast out demons and save people, right? So why does he refuse this woman? 3. Ridiculous advice from Jesus. [3] Okay, I am not quite sure if people nowadays think this is a good idea - I sure hope you don't - but here is what Jesus advised people to do in Matthew 18:7-9: ""Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell."" There's just one small problem with this. It is not at all possible for your hand to 'cause you to sin,' it is your brain telling you to sin. Nor is it the fault of your eye or foot. If Jesus was god he would have realised this, and if he did, he would probably tell everyone to cut out their brains, because that is definitely what an intelligent god would do. If there are so many contradictions and ungodly things that occur in the Bible, how can it be a holy book? There is just too much evidence, even within the Bible itself, that points to the non-existence of Jesus Christ. [1] http://www.davidicke.com... [2] http://www.jesusneverexisted.com...

Sf4081bc4-A99ef996d	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	Before I start my actual arguments, I would just like to say this is my first debate on this site, and I don't necessarily believe in the position I'm advocating. But I do have experience debating in college, so here goes… There are a few things I would like to state that I believe are important to my argument. First, I will contend that god has given man free will. I believe this is in line with the most reasonable sects of Christianity. Having said this, I will first address my opponents arguments. My opponent contends that sending people to hell for not believing is excessive considering god offers no proof of his existence. The problem here is that god has offered proof of his existence, his word (the bible) and his son (Jesus). God offers a direct path and method to reach him, this alone should be enough to justify ones belief. One has the choice to embrace or reject god, if one requires more evidence to believe, then one must also accept the risks of not believing. This argument seems based on the idea that reaching heaven should be easy. God gives us the ability to live our life the way we wish. If man should choose to reject god, why should god choose to accept them? My opponents next point is that hell should not be created in the first place. When one really thinks through the concept of hell, one clearly sees its purpose and necessity of it, If man has free will, he has a choose to good or evil. If man believes that there is only a good place to go when he dies (heaven), then what incentive does man have to do good. Hell exists so man has an incentive to do good. God would hope that man does good, but if man does bad, then why reward that person? As for the ant example, I don't really believe this applies in this instance, but if later I am proven wrong on this point, I will answer it at that time. Now to why sending people to hell for not believing is good. Believing in god is the path to heaven. As stated in my opponents introduction, believing is Jesus and god is the only way to have one's sins forgiven. If one has rejected the only path to forgiveness, then god is justified in sending those people to hell. The evil they have done in this world remains a stain upon them, and so they must pay for their wrongs. God has given us life, and has given us the ability to live our lives the way we wish. Our very existence is due to him. God has given us everything, and offers paradise upon our death, and what does he ask in return? Simply to believe, and not even for your entire life, just that you eventually come to believe in him. For everything god gives us, if we are unwilling to offer anything in return, then god is more than justified in punishing us.	CON	341

Pro insist on saying things like "" God's Word describes who/what the Holy Spirit is; this obviously doesn't just prove that the Holy Spirit is real"" as if she actually proved something. Actually she simply stated something, she is confused that to prove something you must show physical or visual evidence the thing is what it is. 3. I want a rebuttal for my argument concerning that the Universe is evidence for the Holy Spirit and what do I get? A typical atheist answer: ""Well, actually it literally proves matter exist--nothing else."" 3a. The universe proves nothing except matter exist. There is no test out there that demonstrates this holy spirit thing created matter. 3. Let me ask you, how did the matter get there? It came out of thin air...oh wait, in the very beginning there WAS no air...hmm? The very fact that what I explained is true is proof that a Creator is quite likely and that the Holy Spirit is part of the tri-une, almighty Creator God. 3b. Vacuum State. ""the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of existence."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Be sure to click on the sources Wiki cite. Quantum mechanics demonstrates matter, created by random electromagnetic particles, never ceases to exist by only keeps changing from solid to liquid to gas to liquid to solid and so forth. The vacuum state means electromagnetic particles have no creator, since they pop in and out of existence all the time. Are you willing to profess the holy spirit is at work, randomly causing particles to pop in and out of existence with no purpose? Scientists are working on a collider that can turn light into matter. http://www3.imperial.ac.uk... Once this is achieved, your holy spirit theory is dead, simply because this places humans as powerful as your alleged holy spirit power. Of course this has to be accomplished but the implications means if humans can do, it can naturally occur on it's own. 4. The first video you posted is proof that there have been investigations on the events and occurrences and these investigations turned out positive and proving that the Christian's claim is true. 4a. Nope. Top video, at 3:50-4:40 the experiment shows that the guy's frontal lobe--that control language--was active when he prayed in English, but when he prayed in that babble called tongues--his frontal lobe was mostly inactive. It proves he wasn't speaking a real language. Science proved his babble wasn't a real language because his brain wasn't actively interpreting it. So when people claim to understand that babble their lying because their frontal lobe is actually inactive, not even processing it because it CAN'T translate ""blah, blah, blah"" into any real words. 5. Acts 2 you showed but did not point out anything worth talking about. 5a. Let's test that shall we. Tongues: Greek word #1100 glossa = a language (specially, one naturally unacquired) When they spoke this tongue, everybody understood it, the Scripture lists 18 different languages that understood it AT ONCE! Not like today's so-called tongues where only another possessed person can think that he understands it. The Pentecostal Day (Acts ch. 2) tongues were heard and understood by all languages: Acts 2:4-11 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. 6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? 8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. (KJV) http://www.biblestudysite.com... There you have your Greek word for tongue/languages and a Christian website claiming the ""spoken tongues"" were 18 different human languages. 5b. Man claims he can speak in tongues at random. http://www.youtube.com... 5c. Benny Hinn, a man of God, who uses the holy spirit to get rich on frauds http://www.youtube.com... 5d. Former Pentecostal Christian can still speak in tongues to God. MUST SEE http://www.youtube.com... 5e. Christian Pastor says Pentecostals are deceived and proves it with his bible. 15:00-17:25 and at 17:25 he explains Acts 2 just like the Christian website Biblestudysite.com, just like Shadow King's Trinity debate he won, just like many others. http://www.youtube.com... 6. First I ask you, why would all those people CARE or even bother creating a whole language, practicing speaking it, and then spending half their lives at church worshiping a figment of their imagination and posting YouTube videos about it? That's a huge ""fraud."" Second of all, I'd like to see you try to speak the way Anita did. If you can do that exactly show us all. Then what will be laughable? 6a. Benny Hinn, fraud-claims he talked to Jesus just like John in Revelation; Jim Jones, fraud-murdered his followers just to keep them from finding out he was a fraud; Creflo Dollar, fraud--claims God loves to give out money but isn't the ""love of money the root of all evil"", the list is long of Christians creating frauds, living them and teach them with no problem. 6b. Why the hell would I want to attempt to speak babble like Anita. The million dollar test of truth is this: If you can speak tongues, and tongues is the language of God, tell us what someone on one of these videos is saying, interpret it, and provide proof we can verify that's what is being said. Oh, but wait, you shall claim you can't speak tongues, or that person's tongues is not meant for you to know or you have no interest in that. You will come with anything that refuses to here and now demonstrate for an uncontested debate win that the holy spirit gave you the knowledge of what was said and the proof to glorify God right now in front of man. Truth is, you're a semantics players. You bounce off words like ""this is proof"" and ""I have proved"" as if voters are so gullible to believe your a mere claim of proof is proving it is proof. wtf!!!"	CON	343

S393ece2c-A6f2e4cf	The Problem of Hell Redux	"I will now attempt to show the problems with my opponents position; Con has basically replied to almost all my objections with an all purpose response: ""you can't apply 'human' ethics to God."" I'll call this the ""divine immunity"" defense. Some might look at this as a convenient away to escape any ethical criticism leveled at the depiction of God my opponent holds to - I happen to agree - but I will go ahead and show the weaknesses of this position. Barring that, precious little has been done to nullify my objections. If this defense fails, his case fails. I just want to point out that Con reasons that because Christians belief the bible is infallible that means that any scriptural references are infallible. That is a simple matter of logic. One doesn't follow from that premise is that any use of scriptural references is infallible; one may be simply misusing or misinterpreting scripture. The scripture may be infallible but the interpreter is not. Additionally, simply appealing to sometimes ambiguous scripture isn't going to do the work Con wants it to; he must support his interpretations and answer philosophical objections. The Divine Immunity Defense I want to note the contradiction that has been running through nearly all of Con's rounds. On one hand, Con tries to say 'human' rationality and ethics don't apply to God. On the other hand, he attempts to reason about God from scripture; this a paradigm case of human rationality applying to God no matter how limited humans' rationality is. Additionally, he argued that my ethical objections don't work because ethics only applies to humans in this case. But look at what Con has been arguing - he's saying that God would be moral and just if he did condemn some to eternal, conscious torment. These pronouncements are ethical and moral judgements. If Con were thoroughly consistent Con would not be using moral and ethical statements to describe how God acts because, remember, Con thinks 'human' ethics don't apply to God. Con appeals to dictionary definition of 'ethics' in order to show that 'human' ethics doesn't apply to God. I suspect his reasoning relies on an equivocation because ethics talks about a PERSON'S behavior. An essential claim to Christianity is that God is a PERSONAL being. [1] So even on that definition we could say that we can talk about ethics in relation to God. Only if Con equivocates and says that person = human being would his argument even get off the ground. It may be that all human beings are persons but it doesn't follow from this claim that all persons are human beings. The biggest problem with this divine immunity approach is the following: it strips moral terms of all their meaning when applied to God. Every Christian wants to say that God is good, just, fair, etc. If we say God is good there has to be something we mean by that otherwise we are just speaking incoherent nonsense and gibberish about God. As J.S. Mill (an atheist) astutely writes: ""To say that God's goodness may be different in kind from man's goodness, what is it but saying, with a slight change of phraseology, that God may possibly not be good? To assert in words what we do not think in meaning, is as suitable a definition as can be given of a moral falsehood. Besides, suppose that certain unknown attributes are ascribed to the Deity in a religion the external evidences of which are so conclusive to my mind, as effectually to convince me that it comes from God. Unless I believe God to possess the same moral attributes which I find, in however inferior a degree, in a good man, what ground of assurance have I of God's veracity?"" Similarly, Eric Reitan (a Christian) writes: ""Consider hellists—by which I mean those who think that God consigns some of the creatures He loves to an eternity of excruciating torment, torment that does them absolutely no good. While some hellists seek to offer a 'theodicy' of hell—that is, an account of why such divine activity is compatible with the goodness of God—others retreat behind the cloak of divine mystery. They point out that God’s ways are not our ways, that divine goodness transcends our comprehension, and that it is therefore simply presumptuous for anyone to question the (supposedly clear) biblical teaching that God expresses his perfect goodness in part by subjecting some creatures to unremitting anguish more extreme than we can possibly fathom. ... In short, if we shroud God in total mystery, the claim the God is good becomes compatible with any motives or behaviors or commandments we might possibly attribute to God. But if that is right, what are we saying when we say God is good? If saying this about God is compatible with asserting simply anything else about God--if nothing is either implied or excluded when we say it--are we really saying anything at all?"" [3] Both put their finger on an important problem. They both point out that for us to even consider God good we need to mean something when we say the word ""good"". If categorically unethical and evil things - like either torturing or allowing people to damn themselves forever - are considered ""good"" you've simply stripped the terms of saying anything significant. Saying that God's goodness is infinitely greater than ours (a true claim) is not the same as saying God's ""goodness"" is completely different than ours (a false claim). David Baggett and Jerry Walls (two proponents of a sophisticated moral argument for God's existence) stress that God's goodness must be ""recognizable"" in order for our ascriptions of good to make sense. [4] If God can perform those unethical and evil things - like I have maintained the doctrine of hell is (which as gone virtually unchallenged - then God is not ""recognizably good"". Additionally, even the bible seems to tell against the latter proposition. Paul writes, ""when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them."" (Rom. 2:14-15) This seems to show that we have at least some grasp on moral truths and this presumably comes from God. The Free-Will Defense Here Con just repeats his assertions that human beings would choose a fate of eternal, conscious torment without interacting with my arguments I set forth in round 3. Extend my arguments. The Heart-Hardening/Memory Wipe Defense Here again Con just repeats his assertions without interacting with the point I made about love essentially involving caring about other loved ones' well being. Thanks to Con nonetheless for debating and thanks to the bystanders for reading. Sources [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au...

S553a1156-A4e1b2387	HUMANITY IMMORAL/DESTINED to Hell at BIRTH	"If We Were Born Destined to Hell Would Pro Admit This? ""Cons blashemy- These 2 verses simply help to imply that God likes to protect the little, the vulnerable children."" I'm pretty sure babies are very little and very vulnerable meaning if we die at birth we go to heaven, meaning we are not destined to Hell at Birth. Burden-of-Proof and Morality I do not have to prove the existence of morality, Pro has to prove that humanity is immoral. I need only argue that Pro has failed to prove this and Pro loses the debate on the resolution 'humanity is immoral'. In fact he only wrote 'humanity immoral/destined to hell from birth' so even though he lacks an 'is' after 'humanity', I won't troll by attacking the grammar since it's quite clear he meant to write 'humanity is immoral and/or destined to hell from birth' when he says 'at' what he really means is 'from' but if he wants to only focus 'at' the birth, most of my points defeating it are still going to stand. Rules and Disregarding Them I have broken no rule of the website in this debate nor rule of the debate itself. I supplied reasoned argumetn with evidence, not pure rhetoric opinion (which was indeed a request by Pro to avoid in Round 1 that I have upheld). The Bible Verses Pro Provides I shall analyse these one-by-one and keep the analysis relevant only to the resolution. 1) Proverbs 30:6 Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar. I believe that here, Pro is pointing out that if he added to my words (such as quoting me and directly rebutting) he feels he'd only be adding to my ability to rebuke him and prove him to be a liar. I guess he's right, I would rebuke him and prove him to be a liar. The lack of rebuttal, however, doesn't win him any credibility. 2) Deuterenomy 4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. https://www.biblegateway.com... I reworded this to exact verse for the sake of authenticity. If I am understanding correctly, he just compared adding to my arguments as adding to what God commands and further implies to to take away from my arguments would be subtracting from God's commands. Thanks for comparing me to God and my word to his commands, I really appreciate that level of admiration but I must humbly decline this comparison for I am not the almighty God. 3) 2 Peter 1:20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. Alright then. I'll agree to that. Let's negate the whole bible then? If the whole Bible is to be negated on the grounds that it's not the prophet's interpretation of things, we can say the resolution cannot be proven true since it relies on the Bible or at the very least the Qur'an but thus far, no Qur'an verses have been mentioned by Pro. 4) Revelation 22: And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll. https://www.biblegateway.com... All I can think that Pro is trying to get at here is that I shouldn't add to any Bible quotes. If I don't add to them then I can't analyse them and debate about interpretations ofthem that negate the resolution and thus Pro's case. I don't understand how we can have a debate without adding to the Bible verses with words and evne Pro wrote his own words in his debates that clearly have added to the Bible verses since the words don't equal zero. 5) 1 Corinthians 3:14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. https://www.biblegateway.com... I think that my work abides by the case I am building it upon so yeah, thanks, I look forward to my reward. 6) 1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. https://www.biblegateway.com... So, if Pro loses this debate, he shall be saved by fire. That's alright then, he can let his work get burned by me then, at least he'll be saved by the fire. 7) Revelations 14:10-11 This is a funny one. He gives no context of the quotes so I will: Revelations 14:6-12 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. As you can see, 10 and 11 were referring to those who take Satan into their hearts and worship him. Even if the person does so, it is explicitly pointed out in the last line that I quoted that the Saints are patient and repentance has yet to be proven to be unattainable even when one is this far gone. 8) Mark 16:15-16 And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. This quote applies to those capable of doing so. It does not apply to a baby, incapable of doing so. That means that we must look to other verses to see what God's default judgement of a birthed baby is before concluding that one who cannot spread his word is going to be judged as (by default) evil. We Are Not Born Sinners, Jesus' Sacrifice Negated All Sin Up Until That Point Towards the ending of Pro's Round 2 is incessant rambling about whether or not we are still to be held guilty for the sins of Adam and Eve. I am of the school of thought that we truly are not held responsible for that anymore because what happened at Jesus' death was the following: 1 John 2:1-2 (NIV) 1 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. In John 2:2 it is very clearly implied that even the Original Sin (which occured in this world, did it not?) it being atoned by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. 'He' is Jesus in this quote. 1 Corinthians 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. Galatians 3:13-14 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”[h] Quit it with the One-Sin-Breaks-All Analogy to Lying You can lie once in a while and be regarded as a very honest, trustworthy person. You could lie about your weight, your height... Anything that isn't too significant and as long as you do it a significant minority of the time you'd be regarded as an overall honest, trustworthy person. How exactly does one lie make you a liar? If that's true then why isn't it that telling the truth one time makes someone who lies the rest of the time suddenly be a truth-teller? This black-and-white all-or-nothing mentlaity is not at all what God suggests in the Bible. I could give you a ton of Bible verses that show god encourages people to seek to become moral no matter what their past has been and that they are to be forgiven and considered moral if they do keep up with their new way of life, but a ton is too many for just one debate: Luke 17:3-4 | 3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."" Matthew 3:8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. Luke 5:31-32 | 31 Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Acts 3:19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. 2 Corinthians 7:9-10 | 9 yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. 10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. I could go on and on and on. You have yet to prove that we are all immoral or even born that way."	CON	349

Also, in my first year of college; the classes I filled my scdule with were philosphy and religious ones. Political science major here. I know a ‘lil somethen' somethen'. 1. What I was thinking… 2. My point to the tee! I find it out that some people seem to gloss over these points. Religion in the western world just losses credibility all together for that alone. I.e. wants again: gay priest. 3. In the Roman historical docs why then, is there no recorded evidence of jesus? And say he did existence, (which I tend to believe), where does this come from these mythical accounts of resurrection and miracles? 4. Who can trust the church first off and the church took many of stories out and discarded them forming their own bible according to their vision over time. Facts. 5. God can't destroy the devil? If we were debating for the office of president and this was a subject other than religion, I'd rooted you. Case in point: what do you mean he cannot destroy the Devil? The Alpha and Omega! Gasp! The Alpha an omega all powerful and all knowing cannot destroy a devil falling angel or not? Well in fact he can destroy as the bible states in revelations he will eventually be destroyed. At least banished to a pit then destroyed. 6. Once again my biblical Knowledge is up to par… let me critique your arguments even further. Yes it says these things in the bible, but my whole point so the hell what. Many religious text say similar or boast identical accounts. Why would I be inclined to believe the Christian version over another? Because we live in America and people just grow up believing what they hear never question. This is because it's too touchy, to taboo. thennnnnn And that's all it! In such a world where we live crazy, unforgiving, treacherous as world, the thought of a better place after this one comforts-it's still a primitive part of humans, still that animalistic nature in us that allows us to feel this way. No matter how weird it really is. What bothers me too; I think how the pope says the Jews weren't responsible for jesus death. He says this because it is getting taboo to blame them, to have such a large quanity of people in put in danger for the belief. When, in fact, if you follow or know anything about the history; they were. Jesus himself was a Jew. According to the Christianity all the Jews are going to hell not because of that but because they don't believe at all in Jesus. Islamic faith teaches Jesus was a Meer prophet so they too, those billions are deemed to hell. Laughable, course no one knows where you go when you die! How would you?! Also think how many people die in the name of religion. From the crusades to modern kats blowing themselves up (religious fundamentalist) Then people always say always these are the end times. Let me tell you something when you break it down and the religion tells you of catastrophic ends humans by nature will dictate what that means to them. Living in the world we live in, this will always be the case it will not be any utopias anytime soon, and that' not because there is damn Armageddon coming. It's just like when people use to think rain was some anger by the gods directed at them.	CON	351
Se601a988-A221570e4	If Solipsism is believed to be real and true, then theism must also be true and real.	"If solipsism is real, then theism is true. Definitions: Solipsism - 1. Philosophy The theory that the self is the only thing that can be known and verified. 2. The view that the self is the only reality. Theism - Belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in a personal God as creator and ruler of the world. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... I observe and understand solipsism to be a philosophical theory relating one's own reality, mere existence, being equated to a complex construct, created within one's own imagination. Essentially, solipsism abides by three presuppositions, ""These are: (a) What I know most certainly are the contents of my own mind - my thoughts, experiences, affective states, and so forth.; (b) There is no conceptual or logically necessary link between the mental and the physical. For example, there is no necessary link between the occurrence of certain conscious experiences or mental states and the ""possession"" and behavioral dispositions of a body of a particular kind; and (c) The experiences of a given person are necessarily private to that person."" http://www.iep.utm.edu... The theist must believe in the existence of one or more Gods. ""God"" can take many forms, God can exist anywhere or in anything, as God is omnipresent. ""Thus, when considering and evaluating theism, we are normally engaged in considering and evaluating a variety of interconnected beliefs, ideas, and assertions."" However, such predetermined beliefs, ideas, and assertions may not be the proper practice for a theist solipsist individual. ""Theism does not depend upon how one arrives at their belief."" http://atheism.about.com... To be religious is to believe in a particular set of principles, however, theism is belief in the existence of a God or Gods (real or imagined). All the many numerous world religions, along with the many religious moral and ethical principles, have all been created in the mind of the solipsist. Theological concepts in Christianity, the Muslim culture, Greek Gods, the very idea of Heaven and Hell, has been created and fully developed in the clear imagination of the solipsist. ""I suppose that one reason I have always detested religion is its sly tendency to insinuate the idea that the universe is designed with 'you' in mind or, even worse, that there is a divine plan into which one fits whether one knows it or not. This kind of modesty is too arrogant for me."" R13; Christopher Hitchens, Hitch-22: A Memoir http://www.goodreads.com... Solipsism makes the argument that ""The Universe"", as you perceive it to be, is designed and produced by one's self. Elevating ones status to that of their own Universe's Creator. The solipsist philosophical viewpoint argues that oneself is the only verifiable reality. The only world which the solipsist knows and understands, is a universe in which ""self"", is the creator and ruler of their own imagined Universe. If I am but one solipsist, creating such an amazing, interesting, mysterious world that seems so vivid, where have I gained such immense knowledge and such a tremendous imagination? Have I innately learned so many languages and cultures? Why would I imagine pain and suffering for so many people throughout the world? In reality, the reality I have created resembles nothing like a blend of Disney and Wonka Land, as I would have imagined, I would have imagined as a solipsist. The solipsist theory requires that the individual must live, and solely exists, as the God of their own Universe. ""When a solipsist dies ... everything goes with him."" R13; David Foster Wallace, Consider the Lobster and Other Essays http://www.goodreads.com... Either the solipsist individual must be God or,""If reality cannot be proven to be more than a construct of consciousness, then in order for the external world to exist independently of my consciousness, it must exist, in full, in some consciousness that is at a higher level than mine. In this case, I am a figment of this higher consciousness""s imagination, as are all the people and beings that I encounter."" Solipsism is dependent upon theism, as the solipsist must be the God of their own Universe or a ""God"" must have created the solipsist. Therefore, in order for the solipsist theory to be true and real, then the theism must also be true and real, in order to maintain the universe and existence of the solipsist ""self""."	PRO	352
S30b19de3-A265f9972	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	No, There is no scientific evidence to prove the existence of a supernatural all knowing creator.

Believing that somehow a group of wandering middle eastern sheep herders who were born before the any age of science or reason, somehow had knowledge about the creation of the universe or the meaning of human existence is ludicrous.

Our universe only existence in the realms of space and time, so if you exist outside of those realms you couldn't exist in this universe. But if he does exist than that means he does take up space and is subject to time. How could God be loving, full of mercy, or full of forgiveness if hell exists? Eternal damnation to a realm full of hell fire doesn't sound merciful or forgiving? What kind of being loves their children so much that they would have them tortured for all of eternity? Not to mention what you go to hell for. Being gay? Homosexuality isn't natural but a talking snake is? Or being an Atheist? Because there was reasonable doubt and I chose to believe in Science which provides actual evidence instead of some Holy book that requires faith instead of facts. I go to hell? I have other points but I will only need them if someone is willing to challenge me.	PRO	353
S39bab7b8-Af5f2d504	The following users will probably go to hell because Christian theism is true.	"My opponent seems very confused as to how resolutions work. He has put forth ""The following users will probably go to hell because Christian Theism is true."" As I have shown, the proper negation of this is ""The following users will probably NOT go to hell because Christian Theism is true."" The alternative negations involve either a nonsensical statement, or lack a change in the status quo. The instigator's burden with the resolution is ALWAYS to urge a change in the status quo. Since my opponent's resolution contains a given that is not part of his contention, I am free to assume that the given is true. This is no different than if someone put forth ""Objects will fall up because gravity is reversed."" Now we all know that gravity can't be reversed, but in the context of the debate, given that gravity is reversed, objects will fall up. Of course, the resolution involves a counterfactual (namely that Christian Theism is true), but resolutions that say things like ""If the Nazis Had Won WWII..."" are perfectly understandable. I'm simply pointing out that my opponent has decided (incomprehensibly) to work in the framework that assumes Christian Theism is true. So.... Given that Christian Theism is true, the users mentioned will probably go to hell, because they all espouse some sort of anti-God position. ************************************************************ >> ""Semantics and invalid logic cannot establish the truth of metaphysical propositions."" Which means they can't establish the falsity EITHER, and you just destroyed your own argument, because, as I've mentioned before, in the absence of compelling reason, the debate reverts to the status quo. >> ""Since my opponent is arguing in the affirmative the burden of proof is on him to show why this statement is true with evidence."" My opponent appears to have not even read his own source... a quote - ""The burden of proof is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit, the best translation of which seems to be: ""the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."""" In other words, my opponent's OWN SOURCE (http://en.wikipedia.org...) states that the person changing the status quo carries the burden of proof. Since our resolution assumes Christian Theism is true, I am not changing the status quo, and need only to show that my opponent's arguments are incomplete. ************************************************************************** I cannot have put it better than my opponent: Everyone on this list is confirmed as being either an atheist or an agnostic. And the resolution my antagonist will try to affirm is that it's reasonable to conclude that these people will have their skeptical doubts rewarded with an eternity of suffering.

You say that you have been on the moon but you haven't, so how could you know for sure it is real? Everything you have stated has been told to you by random people, and brainwashed government officials. I will tackle this argument individually. "" so how could you know for sure it is real?

S90bab8b7-A52c20f5d	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	"A.The Killings of God Note: I sincerely apologize about not giving my opponent what he asked for, I did not see the reasoning and believed he did not see my citations. So here are three main ones that I strongly disagree with: 1. You should not let a sorceress live. (Exodus 22:17 NAB) 2. From there Elisha went up to Bethel. While he was on his way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him. ""Go up baldhead,"" they shouted, ""go up baldhead!"" The prophet turned and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two shebears came out of the woods and tore forty two of the children to pieces. (2 Kings 2:23-24 NAB) 3.Make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and posses the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants. (Isaiah 14:21 NAB) The reasons I do not like these are that they are completely illogical. (1)Sorceress, as you should know, don't exist and if they did why put them here in the first place if you just wanted people to kill them. (2)Killing children for name calling is, for any sane people, completely over punishment. (3) This is unfair to the child which has no control over what there parents do. Besides, since every father has ""guilt"", doesn't that mean everyone should just drop dead? About the challenge my opponent has given me about ""to show people that God and Israel had no right to kill."" This is quite simple. About the Israelites, in the Bible it states, ""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. (Gal. 3:28 NIV)"" This means that all people are equal, but you say the Israelites had a right over all others. God will be a little harder to explain but I'll do my best. Let's take Noah's arc/The Great Flood as an example. God gave us free will, which includes free thinking and the freedom to commit sin. We used this free to question him because of lack of proof, this was counted as sinning. Mass amounts of sinning is thought to be the cause of The Great Flood, God wanted a ""clean slate"". So let me straighten this out, God made a giant flood to kill everyone for using what he gave us this seems unfair. Also about the ""creator destroying his/her creation."" I personally would not kill my creation for simply using what I gave it unless it was causing harm to me, which sin was not causing any harm to God. B.God Endorsed Slavery My opponent states that, ""God never made slaves or slavery and my opponent has the burden of showing He did. We will never find in the Bible that God started slavery."" Although, I never said God created it, I simply said that he allowed it. Next, my opponent states that, ""I guess my opponents is saying that God should stop slavery because it is wrong but then He should stop everything then, right? He should stop you from doing that thing that your parents did not want you to do back then, right? By taking away humans choice to make slaves takes away freedom of decision and that is truly wrong."" The only problem with this is that God has outlawed many things, such as murder, but instead God says its okay if you do. Lastly, I'd like to talk about the ""good and bad in all."" My opponent challenges me to say that slavery is ""bad in all circumstances."" This is impossible with everything, everything has good and bad effects. In this case though, the bad effects greatly out-weigh the good. Also why didn't God make slavery optional for the slave, doing this would allow people who were starving, homeless, and dying an easy way out. C.God is not just, nor does He have a heart First off, I don't believe in Jesus or God, yet I ""fully live morally"", in my opinion. Anyway, my opponent says the if someone goes to Hell it's there fault not God or Jesus'. For this point, I would like to ask a series of questions: 1. Who controls everything? God 2. Who made Hell? God 3. Who made criteria that I must meet to go to Heaven? God These string of questions can easily be used to help us believe that God sends us to Hell, we may have sinned, but he is the one who chooses to send us to Hell, not us. This last part is me explaining to my opponent what I mean by ""heart"" and how I believe we should be viewed by God. I'm speaking of the theoretical heart and having qualities, such as empathy, compassion, and forgiveness. About God's view, I believe that if he does exist he should see us as if he was a mother and we are his baby that is learning to walk and that even though we mess up and have doubt, he should be there to support us and help us understand what we did wrong and let us try again. D.What's The Point of Hell? First let me start by explaining to my opponent what this section is for. I made this section to argue about the reasoning of Hell eventhough it helps nobody. I would understand Hell if God sent us back to mortality, to try again, or into Heaven after a certain amount of time, but he doesn't. He does not give a second chance and because of this Hell's one purpose is to torture those who did not believe, but as I said in an earlier comment, a punishment is used to teach, that's why we have discipline and we don't make it enable for the person to ""put there teachings into play."" The only time this isn't the case, is during a life sentence or death penalty. These put into play the second use of punishment, making an example. When you ""make an example"" out of someone, this shows other people that ""they shouldn't do this or this is what's going to happen."" Although this doesn't apply to to Hell either for we cannot see people in, what you say is, ""the feeling and appearance it will be without God your Creator"" on Earth. We can only see when we are already dead and there are no rooms for ""do overs""."	PRO	358

Sd63073be-Acbf16d74	The Many Worlds Interpretation can resolve the problem of Hell	"(this is my first debate, so please tell me if I make any grammer or spelling mistakes) For centuries, one question has perplexed Christian thinkers, how can God be omnibenevolent while sending people to Hell? 2 Peter 3:9 ""The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."" shows that God wants everyone to be saved, God is also Omnipotent and his will is always done, which is a contradiction unless explained through the Many Worlds Interpretation. The Schrï¿½dinger's cat thought expirement shows that the cat was both dead and alive simultaniously until it was observed, which forced it to take one state or another. In practical terms, every outcome of every possibility is played out, from whether an electron spins in one direction or another, or whether a person chooses to be saved. So logiclly, whenever someone is told about Christ, he or she must make a decision whether or not to accept him and like every other event in the universe, both events play out and only the observation of the event forces the person to be saved or not, so everyone who has ever been told about the Gospel is simultaniously saved and not saved.

S224da923-Adf1c8371	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"what it has to do with what's going on currently is that 2008 was the year both teams began to experience change. 1. Real Madrid saw a huge overhaul of their team after the 2008-2009 season. Only 4 of their starting XI from that season still play for them. That summer Madrid sold 88.5 million Euros of players and bought 259 million euros worth of players.(1) Any team that loses the likes of Huntlerlaar, Robben, Heize, Cannavaro and Van Nistelrooy whilst gaining the likes of Kaka, Ronaldo, Benzema and Alonso is going to be a radically different team. Barcelona won those 6 titles not only several years ago but also against a much different Real Madrid team. The Barcelona team was not even completely the same with as I mentioned before neither Henry or Eto'o still playing for Barcelona. In fact Real Madrid went from finishing 9 points behind Barcelona in 2008 to finishing 3 points behind them in 2009. With that said they had the skill to move past that and win 6 consecutive cups/leagues proving they are the best. 2. Or more appropriately that they were the best. Barcelona is a slightly different team now, whilst Madrid is a much improved team now. Especially in Europe the strength of teams have change dramatically since 2008, as I stated before Manchester City finished 40 points behind Man U in the premiership of the season Barcelona won 6 titles.(2) The 6 titles that Barcelona won in 2008 is irrelevant to Barcelona Real Madrid discussions today. 2009 was the year where they only obtained one trophy but they did hell of a lot better than Madrid. 3. Barcelona had only really swapped Eto'o for Ibrahimovic by this point as I mentioned earlier Real Madrid saw practically the whole team change. With the amount of player changes, with almost all coming from different teams and leagues it is going to take time to adjust. It is also worth noting that Madrid only came 3 points behind Barcelona and scored more despite the lack of playing time as a new team. they won both matches and that tie was their win 4-3. 4. They won a match and drew the other. As you stated yourself concerning Real Madrid in the first game ,""they scored the first goal then decided to play defensively the entire game giving the opportunity to Barcelona to try and score as many goals as possible.,"" making it sound as if Madrid made a tactical mistake rather than being an inferior team. In the second leg Sergio Rammos had a goal disallowed which I thought should have stood, of course this was before either of Madrid's accepted goals so it is extremely difficult to judge what would have happened. Goal.com even stated that Madrid were the better side during the opening half and Barcelona's goals were against the run of play(3). None of the recent games between the sides have shown a clear superiority for Barcelona. The fact still remains that real Madrid needs to start playing more as a team than separate players. 5. Barcelona scored 148 goals last season, 98 of which came from the trio of Messi, Pedro and Villa. That's 66% of al their goals by 3 players. Real Madrid scored 146 goals last season. 92 of which came from their 3 top scorer which is 62%. Rather simply the point is that Barcelona are no more cohesive as a team than Madrid is currently. Back in 2009 when this New Madrid team had only just been formed this may have been true, but now it is no longer the case. messi on the other hand is much better at technique, the ability to create an opportunity to score goals 6. In last season's La Liga Messi scored 31 goals and had 18 assists or rather simply created 49 goals . Whilst Ronaldo had 40 goals and 10 assists or created 50 goals in a way(4). These are statistics of the two when they have played the same teams in the same number of games. Obviously technique is a matter of debate but look at that video and state that Ronaldo isn't one of the best in the world technically.. http://www.youtube.com... If we look at the true hard facts between both teams Barcelona is currently better. 7. Madrid is 5 points ahead of Barcelona; that is a fact. Madrid has a better goal difference in La Liga, which is also a fact. Madrid did better in the group stages of the Champions league this year. They have two Fifa player of the year winners on their team compared to Barcelona's one. They have scored more goals in La Liga for the past 3 years( comparing other competitions would be less useful due to them playing different teams) proving they have the more effective attacking play. 3 Real Madrid defenders are on the Spanish national team compared to Barcelona's two(5). This is in spite of the fact that 3 of Madrid's defenders are not Spanish whilst Barcelona has only 2 non Spanish defenders. . These are all cold hard facts backing Real Madrid as being the better team currently. (1) http://en.wikipedia.org... (2) http://www.goalzz.com... (3) http://www.goal.com...

S90bab8b7-Af2af53c1	If God is Real He's Unfair and Unjust	"A.The Killings of God :1. The only interpretation I can get is that my opponent believed there was witches. If that's not what my opponent is saying, then I'm sorry.: That was very well what I am suggesting. My opponent never gives any reason to believe that witches don't exist other than her appeal to assumption. On top of the fact that if witches do not exist then the laws made to kill them are not going to harm anyone. :2. About punishing the parents, this is unfair to the children. Why not just punish the parents and take in the children and teach them ""God's way."": Children automatically go to heaven upon death. Now with that in mind, what if the only way to open the eyes and humble the parents is by the death of their child? Maybe the only way to turn the parents to call on God was to take their children(BTW were gifts of God.) This also goes into laws of that day that children who did not respect elders were killed. The reasons the children acted this way was because of the teachings or lack thereof by the parents. Which is why the Bible refers to this punishment as intended for the deeds of the parents. :3. ""This command seems to be directed to the Medes and Persians,"" but it never says so in context. Because of this I'd like to say that this is undecided due to lack of evidence of both sides.: It very much says so in the context. My opponent should read the chapters before and after this verse. In chapter 13 it refers to Babylon, Medes and Arabia. In chapter 14 it also adds Lebanon, Assyria and Palestine. :The other thing I'd like to address is, ""You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me."" (Exodus 20:5) This is god admitting to being jealous, which against one of the seven deadly sins but that's not relevant.: Jealousy is not one of the seven deadly sins, my opponent confuses jealousy with envy. There can be good and bad jealousy. EX. A husband is jealous over his wife and a parent is jealous over their child. Note: The N.T. and O.T. are intertwined but for different messages. The O.T. is the establishment of the law and future prophecies. The N.T. is the fulfillment of the law and more prophecies. Therefore laws that were commanded in the O.T. are no longer valid to followers in the N.T. because Jesus Christ fulfilled them. EX. O.T. followers had to sacrifice animals and kill sinners to rid the sin amongst them. The price of sin is death. Once Jesus Christ came and died for men , that sacrifice was for all-time and there was no longer need for man to sacrifice for the sin. B.God Endorsed Slavery :""Endorse - Declare one's public approval or support of"". Is God not approving slavery? Is he saying that it's okay to own a slave? Yes. I've given a Bible verse already showing that God approves it. That's all I have to say to end this topic.: The verse my opponent gives never says God endorses slavery or God wants slavery. God simply gives judgements on slavery. My opponent never shows us that men did not cause slavery. Furthermore she never shows that God wasn't simply giving His people restrictions on having slaves. She never rebuttals about slavery being a major part of society back then. She never connects slavery to the N.T., showing that the Biblical message requires slavery. Pro has alot more to show then what has been given to prove God actually endorsed slavery instead of just putting restrictions on it for Israel. C.God is Not Just, Nor Does He Have A Heart :1. God says he's almighty himself. (almighty - Having absolute power; all-powerful): Yes, God is all-powerful and by being all-powerful, He has the power to allow you to make free choices to determine your own fate. :4. ""I made this section to argue about the reasoning of Hell even though it helps nobody. I would understand Hell if God sent us back to mortality, to try again, or into Heaven after a certain amount of time."" In this quote I'm saying that would seem much more useful if we gave people a chance after Hell to put what they've learned into affect or giving them a timed punishment, not that no punishment should be issued.: To make this reasoning valid, my opponent had to show that people would change after hell. We see all throughout society of people receiving punishment for their crimes and still they do them. Punishment does not necessarily deter criminal behavior. It is clear from the Bible that God hates rebellion against Him and this is what hell is for, for those who would rather not serve God and rebel against His will. My opponent did not offer us a better deterrent for those who wish not to serve God. Conclusion: My opponent never shows us conclusive evidence that God is unjust. She simply is uneducated from a Biblical standpoint. This debate turned into more of a education of Biblical theology than a debate. My opponent had all the BOP and did not fulfill it.

Pro writes ""Farmer: “Well, I was hoping to take my rightful place in the Kingdom of Heaven.”"" For starters, we can see that this farmer is an arrogant man. ""Rightful place"" indeed! That's one obvious strike against his moral character. Pro writes ""Farmer: “But I was just a simple farmer living a blameless life, what was my sin?”"" Secondly, the farmer is patently a liar, as well as a horrible sinner. Romans 3:23 ""all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God."" Obviously, God could have found the farmer's life blameful, so not only was the farmer an unrepentant liar but he actually had the audacity to stand at the entrance to Heaven, lying to St. Peter, and claiming that he should be let in. I ask the audience; does this sound like a man worthy of Heaven? Bear in mind that he's doing all these bad things right in God's doorway. Pro writes ""St Peter: “You gazed admiringly at one of your neighbour’s oxen and wished that you owned the beast instead of him – you vile fiend – and you didn’t repent of your sin before you died.”"" More damning yet is this additionally evidence against the abomination of a farmer! Not only is he an arrogant liar, but he was covetous of his neighbor's property. This is further testimony against his truthfulness as well, as he just claimed he was ""living a blameless life"", which he obviously wasn't if he took any opportunity he had to be jealous of his neighbor's property. Pro writes ""Farmer: “I admit that I was jealous of my neighbour’s ox, and I know that was wrong, and I was on my way to church to repent when this Transylvanian nobleman came up and rammed a big pointy pole right up my…anyway, suffice to say I didn’t make it to the church.”"" If he had never sinned in the first place, he wouldn't be in this predicament. It's his own bloody fault, and his pathetic attempts to shift the blame elsewhere should be anathema to any sane-minded individual. Clearly, my opponent's hypotheticalizing has done nothing but confirm the soundness of Catholic teachings regarding Heaven. Pro writes ""Why should you be allowed to enter Heaven, if you have not repented from the evil that you did on earth?”"" For some reason, my opponent assumes the only way to repent is to fast. If a fat Catholic realized the error of his/her ways, stopped eating to excess, started to exercise, and moved to Africa to help the poor, but failed to fast, then are they repentant or not? I think it's pretty clear that they are. Additionally, we also have the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, which absolves you without you even needing to be repentant (CCC §1520), and I'm sure an obese could sneak in to an anointing session run by an old priest with bad eyesight and get himself/herself/itself anointed. Pro writes ""Therefore, I cannot accept that “Absolving (fat) people of sins and letting them go to heaven even if they refuse to fast” is a part of the Catholic faith."" Your acceptance of it is irrelevant. Pro writes ""Indeed, some Tea Party supporters might argue that the fires of HELL are the real cause of global warming, which is also why I refute “that even if they do die and go to HELL, they will not burn because HELL went out.”"" §1033 of the CCC says HELL is not even a place, but a state. Regardless of whatever interpretations you drew from the Bible, the Catholic Church overrides you, since we're discussing Catholic beliefs. Therefore, even if everyone in the world ends up in Catholic HELL, none of them will burn and the resolution is negated. My opponent also more or less ignored my second special case, as I wrote in Round 1: ""There may be a fat Catholic who neither overeats to the degree that they are committing the sin of GREED, nor is lazy to the degree that they are committing the sin of SLOTH, but who just has a genetic disorder that makes them obese."" My opponent seems to assume that being fat is a deadly sin, which can be easily refuted by viewing his own source. If someone is genetically predisposed to being fat, and so becomes fat without either being GREEDy or SLOTHful, they will not be in a state of mortal sin. Therefore, they would neither be a miserable SINNER nor someone doomed to burn in HELL. In conclusion, I have given good reason to doubt both parts of the resolution (""Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS"" and ""(Fat Catholics) who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL""). I thank my opponent for this debate. Sources: 1. Catechism of the Catholic Church"	CON	372

The development of cells overtime is why evolution is real. Also, there are fossils. With fossils, we have been able to date animals back to certain years within the layers of the Earth. Also, we have found numerous bones from Neanderthals, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus species of humans. We have been able to piece together the bones and figure out how similar our species, the Homo Sapiens, and the previous species have been similar. It's not magic, it's just evolution. We have also been able to track DNA from Chimpanzees and see the RNA/DNA similarities. Scientists have also been able to recover DNA from Neanderthals and have found genetic similarities. And its not a common creator that proves why we are similar, it is a common ANCESTOR that makes us all similar to many animals.	PRO	374
S91b6b3a2-A801c595e	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"This will be a rebuttal to Pro’s opening arguments. His argument can be summarized like so: 1. If you sin but do not believe, you go to hell when you die. 2. The unborn sin. 3. The unborn do not believe. 4. Therefore, the unborn go to hell when they die. You can probably already tell from my opening that I agree with Pro’s third premise, but I disagree with his second premise. Rather than repeat all my reasons for disputing the second premise, I’ll just refer the reader to my opening where I gave five arguments against the second premise, including a refutation of his defense of his second premise. I’ll defend that case against Pro’s rebuttal in the next round. In this round, I’m not going to show that the first premise is false. I just want to show that Pro’s defense of the first premise is invalid. Pro’s defense of the first premise comes from John 3:16, which says, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" The key part that I want to focus on is where it says, “whoever believes in him shall not perish.” My contention is that this statement does not support Pro’s first premise. We can see this by examining the logically equivalent statements that can be derived from “whoever believes in him shall not perish.” Any categorical statement can be rephrased into an “if-then” statement. For example, the statement, “All men are mortal,” can be restated to say, “If one is a man, then one is mortal.” They both mean the same thing. So, let’s rephrase our statement: 5. Whoever believes in him shall not perish. 5 means the same thing as: 6. If one believes in him, then one shall not perish. Taking the contrapositive, this statement is logically equivalent to this: 7. If one perishes, then one does not believe. That’s all we can do. For those not familiar with “contrapositive,” let me explain that.[4] In a modus tollens syllogism, the consequent of the first premise is denied in the second premise.[1] It looks like this: 8. If P, then Q. 9. Not Q. 10. Therefore, Not P. Let’s assume that 8 is true. With that being the case, it follows that IF 9 is true, THEN 10 will be true. Let’s put that in a statement: 11. IF not Q, THEN not P. In other words, if 8 is true, then 11 is true, and vice versa. 8 and 11 are logically equivalent statements. One is the contrapositive of the other. Now let’s get back to Pro’s argument. As we’ve seen, the key statement in John 3:16 can be stated as follows: 6. If one believes in him, then one shall not perish. And. . . 7. If one perishes, then one does not believe. However, Pro attempts to infer from John 3:16 that: 12. If one does not believe, then one shall perish. But notice that 12 is not logically equivalent with 6 or 7. 12 does not follow from John 3:16. If Pro argues from what John 3:16 actually says, then his argument commits a logical fallacy. If he uses 6 as his first premise, then his argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent.[2] In a syllogism, it would look like this: 6. If one believes in him, then one shall not perish. 13. The unborn do not believe in him. 14. Therefore, the unborn shall perish. If, instead, Pro uses 7 as his first premise, then his argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.[3] In that case, his argument would look like this: 7. If one perishes, then one does not believe in him. 15. The unborn do not believe in him. 16. Therefore, the unborn shall perish. Pro quite clearly argues that since the unborn do not believe in Jesus, they shall perish, i.e. go to hell, when they die. Since he bases that argument on John 3:16, we can see that his argument commits a formal logical fallacy. It is invalid. Pro makes an invalid inference from John 3:16 that is not logically equivalent to what John 3:16 says. So John 3:16 does not support Pro’s first premise. Conclusion There are three premises in Pro’s argument. I have agreed with his third premise. I have shown his second premise to be false. I have shown that his argument for his first premise is invalid.

Thank you to my opponent for offering an interesting topic. To start, let's look at my opponents first sentence. ""God is real can tell because he saved me a lot of times he kept my dad in the world during a tragic time when he slept walked out of a window and fell onto a cement ground."" Aside from the many grammatical errors here, this argument is extremely weak. Due to the fact that this is Pro's first statement and he/she says ""God is real can tell because.."" then that must mean this is the main reason God is real. However, just because you've had one instance in which a miracle happen, that does not mean God is real. Perhaps the real cause of Pro's father being alive is the fact that he fell just right and it is more of a medical miracle then anything else. My opponent goes on to say God is real because he spoke to him in his sleep. Well, I've almost been eaten by a 3-headed dragon in my dreams. Does that make them real? Of course not. Pro goes on to bring up the Bible. Well, to answer my opponents question, there is a bible for the same reason there is a Twilight series. Someone wrote them. Perhaps in a dark time, a few wise old men got together and decided their people needed some hope, so they came up with a fictional character to help them. Pro also ask's why do miracle's happen? Well, as I stated earlier, there are miracles. But they aren't necessarily God's doing. If a baby is born against all odds, it's a medical miracle. If you see a shooting star when you're having a bad day, you got lucky enough to witness SCIENCE. Miracles do not mean God. Pro asks why 32.5% of people believe in him. And that's easy. We want hope. We want a higher being backing us up and telling us everything will be okay. My opponent goes on to say there's an opposite to everything so there needs to be an opposite to Satan. Well, as the Con, I'm saying God isn't real. So it'd only be logical for me to assume if there is no God, there is no Satan. In conclusion, there is an explanation for everything.

Sa2c4dff2-Ad12174c2	God is not real.	Yeah i totally agree with the last paragraph, if that was the case. Religion has caused so many to kill hurt discriminate, for no other reason other than their religion. Then they use their religion to say it's ok because god told them to. Plus your statement that god never kills or hurts people is incorrect. Genesis 6:9-9:17 is about how god flooded the earth because they did not believe in him, and he saved a drunk and his family. My first problem with that is that he commits genocide of many different races, secondly he does it because he has not given evidence for himself. Exodus 7:14-11:10 is about the plagues of Egypt, 2 of which stand out to me, the first is the 8th plague where god sends locust to destroy all the crops of Egypt therefore leaving the people to starve. The second is the 10th were god orders all first born sons (some of which would have been under the ages of 10) to be murdered. You may say that it is because he wanted the slaves to be freed but murdering innocent children is evil beyond comparison. Also sending someone to hell, for not believing in a God without proof, to burn for eternity is really harsh. I guess you are right there is no evidence for or against god so people can believe in what they want. The argument should really be that God is evil and causes destruction and was only made up so that we could justify the horrible things we do.	PRO	378
S2acec618-A5ee323e1	Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL	"Since this had ""Catholic"" in the title, I was obligated to accept it. The resolution appears to be ""Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL"". Therefore, my opponent needs to prove that: A) ""Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS"" B) ""(Fat Catholics) who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL"" Sadly for my opponent, my expansive knowledge of Catholicism will almost certainly carry the day in this debate. GLUTTONY and SLOTH are indeed two of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS. I am not a doctor either, so I'll assume my opponent knows what he's talking about when he says the primary causes of obesity are GLUTTONY and SLOTH. Pro writes ""The Bible gives examples of one-day, three-day, seven-day and forty-day fasts (Judges 20:26, Esther 4:16, 1 Samuel 31:13 and Matthew 4 respectively) so priests might determine that a fat SINNER who had let themselves go a bit by scoffing a few too many curries and supping a too much beer, and who had failed to renew their gym membership, might be compelled to complete a one-day fast every month, while longer and more frequent fasts would be allocated to the even more greedy and lazy members of their congregations."" Catholics believe in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, which is able to absolve people of mortal sin (CCC §1422). All a fat Catholic has to do, therefore, is confess his/her/its sins to a priest before they die, and they're safe from HELL. Pro writes ""there is no way the obese bloke is going to convince anyone that he deserves a place in the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, for in addition the GLUTTONY and SLOTH, GREED is another of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS."" If he's not in a state of mortal sin, they'll just wave him on through. What, do you think heaven has time to interview every single person who dies? Let's be realistic here, most of them don't even get a second glance. Pro writes ""It may seem harsh, but woe betide fat Catholics for they are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL for all eternity."" Catholics don't believe anyone burns in HELL, because they don't believe HELL is literally a place of flame and burnination. Therefore, my opponent's argument has major flaws. He can do one of two things, both of which will lead to his defeat. 1) Accept Catholic principles of Reconciliation, HELL not having fire, etc. I will accept these principles without contesting them, but in this case, he will be unable to prove that fat Catholics who refuse to fast will burn in HELL, because Catholic teaching contradicts that idea by: a) Absolving people of sins and letting them go to heaven even if they refuse to fast. b) Claiming that even if they do die and go to HELL, they will not burn because HELL went out. 2) Reject Catholic principles In this case, he will have to give us logical arguments for the existence of HELL, the existence of sin, and justification for fat Catholics being thrown into a fiery HELL. Additionally, my opponent may have overlooked some special cases: 1. The fat Catholic who doesn't fast, but repents There might be some great fat Catholic who realizes he's been overeating and slothing it up, so he cuts his food intake dramatically (but not totally) and starts to exercise after having repented. Unfortunately, as he tries to jog across a road on an attempt to start an exercise regime, the light turns green and a lorry hits him and kills him. Maybe he even planned to fast, but died before he could go any longer than he normally went between meals. Possibly such a person would not go to HELL. 2. The fat Catholic who has a genetic disorder There may be a fat Catholic who neither overeats to the degree that they are committing the sin of GREED, nor is lazy to the degree that they are committing the sin of SLOTH, but who just has a genetic disorder that makes them obese. Since they are not sinning, it is doubtful that they would go to HELL for no reason. If even one fat Catholic refuses to fast and avoids being doomed to burn in HELL, the resolution is negated. I turn it over to my opponent. Sources: 1. Catechism of the Catholic Church"	CON	379

Sae460e9d-A319b87e7	God is real	"At first, I'd like to state that my opponent has attempted to damage and shape my image in this debate saying that if I do not believe in God, I consequently have a high possibility of believing in the Big Bang. He also states that I NEED a scientific reason to believe in how we began to exist, since ""God doesn't cut it to me"", and that ""it all happened spontaneously with no reason"". Well, to get started with, no, I do not believe in the Big Bang theory and I do not need to. Even though, mate, it did not happen with no reason. It is a theory in which the whole Universe was initially extremely small and with an absurd high density and temperature. Then, the Universe NATURALLY started to expand and from ever since it has been constantly expanding. [1] It does not mean it was without reason. It has a reason: its nature. Scientists do not ""turn a blind eye to it and proclaim that's what really happened"" as you claim, and cannot do so, as it is a THEORY. Theories are possibilities, not assurances. After all, theories are theories because they have not been yet proved. God is a theory as well, no different from the Big Bang. I do not need to argue or prove how everything started existing; I am here to defend the view that God doesn't exist. About God speaking to us in flesh, who can assure that what is written in the Bible is true? It started to be written long before Christ; that is more than 2000 years ago. In this process, many European explorers and catholics have interpreted and changed the book as they desired to preach to the native-americans in the New World. And that was around 1500 A.D. forth. Contrary to what God's supposed son, Jesus Christ, there is no historical proof that Jesus actually did miracles as it is written in the Bible. You stated that ""the sad part is that people often confuse evolution for adaptation"". Oh, I'm sorry. So the seasonal vaccine for flu is not because of the evolution & adaptation of the virus to defeat the antibodies, but a useless act. You don't get used and adapted to external situations, like frequenting a new ambient everyday or living in extremely cold places like Russia and hot places like India. Everything is new to you always, is that right? Well, I guess not. Using the same reference you did, I found the sentence from the author ""Scientists know we didn't actually evolve from modern monkeys, but the evidence we have suggests that we have the same ancestor that they do"". Same ancestors = same origin. That already makes your argument invalid. Also in the same website: ""A second line of evidence comes from looking at the bodies of modern animals. If we look at any primate, we will find exactly the same bones, even in primates that spend all of their time in the trees. We have many other similarities, some you can see on the outside, some are internal, and some are biochemical. We can use a variety of tests to see them. For example, if you compare DNA (what is DNA?), you will find that about 98% of our DNA code is just like that of chimpanzees. The other 2% is what makes us different from them"". Read your sources. DNA is part of our genetic materials, indeed, but that is no proof of the existence of a God. It surely makes us think a powerful being might have done these intelligent connections, but it does not prove someone did do it. What if it was all a coincidence, after many occasions in which the Universe happened to produce life in its infinite explosions and cosmic rays, but it was never intelligent enough to survive, and that now it did actually happen to be intelligent? Or what if we are atoms (Solar System might be an atom itself with Sun as the nucleus and planets as electrons) of another being's muscular tissue? It could be anything, but no one can prove it, unfortunately. I never claimed I believe in popular rumors as true, so it is indelicate of your part to accuse me of such. People from human history used to believe that above the clouds there was Heaven, and below ground there was Hell. That was absolute for the people, as everyone believed in this. With scientific advances, we found out that below ground there was water, gases, microorganisms, different types of grains that compose varieties of soils, and that above the clouds there were layers of gas which had an importance in keeping our atmosphere safe, like protection from UV rays provided by ozone, and even space!. In short, it has been proven as a lie. Authorities lied then, they haven't changed much. So if I can't trust a scientist which has a certificate meaning he studied about the subject, why should I trust a missionary which follows what an old, modified book tells? The interpretation of God varies from religion to religion. What is your view of God? Evangelic? Catholic? Islamic? Adventist? Muslim? Jewish? God differs in personality, depending on the religion. Even if you don't have one, the sources available only explain of God in the point of view of a religion, as God can change completely from a view to another. Which one is your God? To believe in God as a possibility for salvation is an old idea. It's called Pascal's Wager.[2] ""To believe in God is better, because it gives you a chance of being saved, rather than being atheist and having 100% chance of being doomed in a positive case"" is a sentence that resumes the idea. But the question is: in which God? How do I know if the Muslims' God is the real one or the Catholics'? It's impossible in this age, as we are too far from the age in which the Bible was written. Perhaps you don't even use the Bible, but the Al-Quran or the Torah. Even though, neither of these books bring us complete assurance that God does exist. As I have asked Pro in the very beginning, he should not take this into a personal, but a scientific manner. Pro is using pejorative means to harm me directly and personally, especially in the conclusion of his Round 2 argument, as he calls me an ignorant for being an atheist. Pro, I ask again, please cease from using such terms. I respect your right to practice a religion, so please respect mine not to do so.

S2acec618-Ae26775ad	Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL	"I would like to thank AlwaysMoreThanYou for accepting this debate and for posting his interesting and amusing misinterpretations of Catholicism. To begin, my opponent wrote: “Catholics believe in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, which is able to absolve people of mortal sin…All a fat Catholic has to do, therefore, is confess his/her/its sins to a priest before they die, and they're safe from HELL.” I wonder how that works in practice. Let’s consider the case of a certain 15th Century prince of Wallachia, a man who was a devout Roman Catholic and a member of the Order of the Dragon which was founded to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe, and who almost certainly confessed his sins to a priest before he died, possibly as follows: . Vlad the Impaler (for it is he): “Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.” Priest: “How have you sinned, my child?” Vlad: “I skewered some people on big spikes and they died horrible deaths as a result.” Priest: “I see, and how many people did you kill in this way?” Vlad: “Sixty thousand give or take a few thousand.” Priest: “Oh well, never mind, these things happen, God forgives you.” . So when Vlad died, because he had confessed his sins, St Peter presumably greeted him warmly at the Pearly Gates, ushered him inside and invited him to help himself to the welcome drinks and canapés. Is that right? So what if the next in line outside the Pearly gates was a Romanian farmer who hadn’t confessed his sins? . St Peter: “Hey, where do you think you’re going, mister?” Farmer: “Well, I was hoping to take my rightful place in the Kingdom of Heaven.” St Peter: “I don’t thinks so, peasant, unrepentant sinners like you aren’t welcome around here.” Farmer: “But I was just a simple farmer living a blameless life, what was my sin?” St Peter: “You coveted your neighbours ox, you evil bastard.” Farmer: “What?” St Peter: “You gazed admiringly at one of your neighbour’s oxen and wished that you owned the beast instead of him – you vile fiend – and you didn’t repent of your sin before you died.” Farmer: “I admit that I was jealous of my neighbour’s ox, and I know that was wrong, and I was on my way to church to repent when this Transylvanian nobleman came up and rammed a big pointy pole right up my…anyway, suffice to say I didn’t make it to the church.” St Peter: “I’m not interested in your excuses, you miserable little pleb, you’re going to HELL and that’s the end of the matter.” . That doesn’t sound a very fair system of deciding who does and who doesn’t get into Heaven, does it? I mean, if anyone who repented their sins were allowed in the Catholic afterlife would be full of mafia bosses, IRA activists and violent medieval aristocrats – so with all the fighting between Italian gangsters, Irish terrorists and ruthless Romanian tyrants, Catholic Heaven would make South Central Los Angeles look like Martha’s Vineyard! I couldn’t believe that the Catholic god would allow this, so I checked and, in actual fact, he doesn’t. This is what Catholic Planet has to say about repentance: “Do not commit any serious sins. But if you have sinned seriously, repent sincerely. True and full repentance happens not merely out of fear of HELL, but also out of love of God and neighbor. Accept true love for God and neighbor, otherwise, you will not be able to fully and sincerely repent. Catholics (and the Orthodox) ordinarily obtain forgiveness from God in the Confessional. Other persons can obtain forgiveness by a full repentance based on the love of God and neighbor; this is called perfect contrition because it is based on the most perfect reason for repenting, true selfless spiritual love. Why should you be allowed to enter Heaven, if you have not repented from the evil that you did on earth?” In other words, those who just go through the motions of repentance aren’t allowed into Heaven: it’s no good some big fat slob spending half his life scoffing burgers, pizzas and fried chicken while watching television documentaries about starving people in the Third World then nipping down to church to confess his sins after he is diagnosed with terminal heart disease and given one week to live - the LORD’s not going to be convinced that he is truly contrite and he’ll duly banish him to HELL. Therefore, I cannot accept that “Absolving (fat) people of sins and letting them go to heaven even if they refuse to fast” is a part of the Catholic faith. Regarding, the nature of Catholic HELL, the Bible is very clear that it is uncomfortably hot: in Mark 9:47–48 Jesus warns us, ""[I]t is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into HELL, where the worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched."" And in Revelations 14:11, we read: ""And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."" Indeed, some Tea Party supporters might argue that the fires of HELL are the real cause of global warming, which is also why I refute “that even if they do die and go to HELL, they will not burn because HELL went out.” Regarding the special cases my opponent mentioned, Catholic Planet is very clear that all fat Catholics who refuse to fast will, indeed, go to HELL because they state categorically that the only special cases are: “babies who die in the womb, or at a very young age” and “severely handicapped persons.” (2) Finally my opponent wrote: “If even one fat Catholic refuses to fast and avoids being doomed to burn in HELL, the resolution is negated.” Since God is supposed to be infallible, no fat Catholic who refused to fast would be admitted into Heaven, and even if one obese deceased did manage to sneak past St Peter, I’m sure he’d soon be spotted amongst the other celestial citizens and be duly cast into the pits of HELL to burn for al eternity along with all the other fat Catholics who refused to fast. I rest my case. Thank you. (1) http://www.catholicplanet.com... (2) http://www.catholic.com..."	PRO	384

S3796484f-Ac88e5cd	Heaven is real	Pro hasn't shown what's wrong with my main argument. I extend it. Pro tries to state he can't give proof because belief is required. I don't see how. Before one learns about gravity or philosophy, he doesn't believe in the theory of gravity or platonism, but one still can come to to believe it from a philosophical or scientific argument. Why should the philosophical position of God and the afterlife be some in sort special position when other positions aren't? It is said that my pride and confidence in intelligence hold me back, this is asserted without evidence. It is especially hard to believe because I have changed my mind in positions that I've held steadfast to and I'm sure a majority of readers have done the same. If Pro is correct, then how could that be possible? Furthermore, Pro is claiming I have these problems, but it seems arbitrary to claim this is the case with me and not with him. Would Pro be satisfied if I claimed that confidence and pride are holding him back from seeing the nonexistence of the afterlife? Pro attacks the argument that God condemns people to hell, however I never made this argument so it is simply a red herring. Pro then makes an argument from religious experience. A changed life, even if it was divine doesn't demonstrate the existence of an afterlife. But, he has yet to demonstrate his experience is divine at all. Many people's lives have been changed with varying outlooks sometimes using with the Christian religion and sometimes not [1. https://richarddawkins.net... 2.http://www.onislam.net... 3.https://www.reddit.com...]. Contradicting positions receiving changed lives show that this type of religious experience doesn't demonstrate anything other than the power of a different outlook.

Sc9cae544-Ab84853d4	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"Glad you got this going again Kvaughan. ~~~ It might be relevant to know that I am coming from Christian - Roman Catholic perspective. The Catholic understanding of God is somewhat more carefully and philosophically defined than in many other Christian denominations. To begin with, it's important to understand the qualities of God and the role in which they play with each other. Omnipotent and omniscient may work for our purposes as a definition of God, but we need to take a look at what you've here called the ""morally perfect"" quality of God. Morality, of course, is prominently defined by the capacity of judgement, so that this would equate into being a ""Perfect Judge"" as well as one who abides by the standards to which he judges. But you haven't here presented this moral perfection in a way that would in any way disparage against Hell. The classic usage, from St. Augustine, rather is ""omnibenevolent,"" or all-loving, which you were using in one of the other arguments. But regardless of what definition we use, we need to first understand that this is a standard to which God chose Himself to be bound by covenant promise. This covenant promise restrains His omnipotence to the standards given in His promise, as it would defy omnipotence to make a promise which is beyond Him to keep. Indeed, of course omnipotence would otherwise be incompatible with any sort of moral restraint whatsoever. So that the question becomes understanding what it is that God has bound Himself to. To a Christian, that is what we understand as Love. Love is a difficult thing to define, but we can recognize a few things right off the bat, and the conclusions which are to be drawn from them. 1) Love requires a separate entity to be the recipient of One's love. -> The Distinctly Separate and Free Will of Man. 2) Love is associated with a desire to share Oneself with another. -> Hence, ""This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."" (John 17:3) Likewise, eternal damnation is to not know God. ""Weeping and gnashing of teeth"" is only an allegory to represent a state of eternal existence which does not know God. 3) Unrequitted love includes a respect for the other person and a refusal to thrust oneself unwanted onto that individual. -> Therefore, the very love of God prevents Him from forcing Himself upon the Free Human Will which has chosen to reject Him. There are others, but this will do for now. The first thing you might notice is probably the relationship between this and a romance. That would be dead-on. ""I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion, And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD. It will come about in that day that I will respond,"" declares the LORD. ""I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth, And the (AV)earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel. ""I will (AW)sow her for Myself in the land I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And they will say, 'You are my God!'"" (Hosea 2:19-23) The parallel is made throughout the Bible and throughout Christian history. It is the Catholic/Christian understanding that a marriage is an earthly ""type"" of what will be perfected in one's relationship with God. In short, you gloss through ""morally perfect"" as a vague concept without alloting to it the specificity which is warranted to both a promise and a relationship. If ""Knowledge of God"" is eternal life, then it would not be in the prerogative of Love to force the other person to accept you, for you then would not a Freely Distinct entity to Love. Once again, you are caught up in the definitions, both of ""Hell"" and ""Morally Perfect."""	CON	391

ANYONE can theorize anything. You don't have to be a scientist to do so (you should know better than this). J. R. Nova once said "" Science is far too limited to prove God. It doesn't even understand why gravity doesn't work at quantum levels. In reality, it doesn't understand much of anything. Have faith, faith is really all we have, even in science"" and for the most part, I tend to agree. If anything, science lean more toward verifying God than it does not. To say that there are many things in science that is spooky and mysterious while disregarding the definition of science, which is ""the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic STUDY of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through OBSERVATION and experiment"" is spooky and mysterious in itself. Telling me that are ""many things in science that are spooky and mysterious"" goes against the very definition of the word....science. You have to admit, that the only thing that can explain these ""spooky mysteries"" is the Creator God that so many non -believers find......spooky and mysterious. No pun intended. On Science I AM disappointed that science has not been able to answer all of these questions, many of which are answered in the Holy Bible, because so many non-believers often quote their god by saying ""that's science"" when trying to prove often moot points. You're admitting that science is often wrong, yea, well, suppose all of these ""100 of scientists"" are wrong about the existence of a Creator God? Are you willing to wager your soul on the probability that they are again...WRONG??? How many mistakes, failures and fallacies have you found in the Bible? Please point them out to me, from Old Testament prophecies to New Testament predictions. They have ALL come into reality.

You say you look around and see all of these material things and they are the fruits of science, yet you say science is only a few hundred years old and material things were around LONG before your religion, science, came into existence. Your assertion is a very foolish one. Man is made up of spirit, remember? Man ""created"" science so science is born of the spirit of man, whether you like it or not.

Should I leave my job for the other offer? ALL wagers. That being said, If God is not real, I have gained nothing nor lost anything by believing. Hey, it made me a slightly less diabolical person while I was alive in consideration of my ""Creator"" and his laws (love thy neighbor as thy self being one of the primary ones) and did ok. If I believe in God and he is real, I have gained eternal life. ON THE OTHER HAND......If I DON'T believe in God and he is not real, what have I gained or lost? Nothing. But if I don't believe and he is real, I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING (including my soul). This is a suckers wager.

Sc9cae544-A11a991db	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"It's actually a little odd and out of place to have to answer a call for providing evidence in this debate. The topic is whether a loving God and Hell are contradictory, but as these are Christian terms, then it is the Christian concept of Hell which is under discussion. Whether these are in sync with reality is another debate entirely, irrelivent to the question of their intrinsic compatibility, thereby making a need for such evidence a fallacy. Nonetheless, I will make every effort to comply, and even without an appeal to obscure, technical sources, which change the results from debate skills to research skills. First, however, I have been presenting a complex argument which needs to develop in layers, and so, even though Kvaughan hasn't quite addressed the fundamental arguments in the last round, before I respond directly, I will develop my argument here in round 4 so that I do not need to do present new material in the final round. 1) The Argument Reformalized God is Omnipotent. In His Omnipotence, God pledged Himself to Omnibenevolence, the ""Word"" through which ""all things were made,"" as the sole and infinite action which perfects Him and brings His will into fulfillment. Omnibenevolence - Love - is the willing sacrifice of Oneself for another, which exposes Oneself's inner core as Love for the other person, done without expectancy because One is moved by the other. But exposing Oneself as being in Love with another unavoidably leaves One vulnerable to judgement - acceptance or rejection - which creates the Hope that One's love is returned. To return another's love is intimacy, to ""know"" the other person as only lovers can. To reject another's love damages oneself in the rejecting (more on this below). We know objectively and resolutely from these consequences of un-returned love that by design, by the Designer, ""Love"" - as a piece of creation - was meant to be reciprocated. In order to Love and sacrifice without expectation, One requires a separate, distinct person to Love, who has the Free Will to accept or to reject One's love. Therefore, God created each member of ""Mankind"" in His own image, endowing them with the Freedom to return His love or reject it. He revealed His inner core as Love for them through the sacrifice of Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man. And He hopes that His love will be returned without expectancy. By definition, Eternal Life is to accept His intimacy, to ""know"" God and His sacrifice of Jesus Christ as only lovers can. Hell, then, is the damage one does to oneself through the act of rejecting the infinite Lover. Consequently, the ""infinite Hell"" is the unavoidable result of rejecting the ""infinite Lover."" 2) One Step Further - The Fall But Mankind is Fallen, so we don't always see it right away. Of the many consequences of this Fall, we neither Love in full or all at once. Consequently, we cannot reject in full or all at once. We live in miniature, here, what we will live in full in the world to come. We take things in baby steps, building and revealing our intentions with another person slowly and imperfectly through our actions. And the result is that we don't often experience the damage we do to ourselves in rejecting another. In the few cases where that rejection is meaningful, we as society are rather distracted by the heartbroken other person. Which leads me to... 3) The Call for Evidence You respond to the argument by saying... >""I challenge this claim by mentioning that love without expectations seems purer than love that expects something in return."" This is what you said in the prior round as well, and I addressed it adequately. You are failing to distinguish between the intentions in loving and the intentions of creating love as something which can be done. I have conceded, and even emphasized, and even defined love by, the notion that it is done without expecting anything in return. But that expectation is on the part of one who is loving, as distinct from one who is creating the concept of love. We know that love, by design, is meant to be reciprocated. We know this from the massive disparity in the consequences of love which is returned and love which is not. One is immensely positive, and the other is downright damning. >""I see very little in the way of external evidence supporting the claim that love is meant to be reciprocated. You have merely fiated that God intends love to be reciprocated and then described a vision of love that is consistent with you love-as-reciprocation view. So as I see it, your argument boils down to love is meant to be reciprocated because God created it that way."" >""Now, we clearly have no way to know how God intended love to work unless he tells us (he is noticeably silent on many issues), but we can look at the evidence and see that many terrific forms of love are often not reciprocated or are imperfectly reciprocated (such as the plethora of forms I mention) and conclude that maybe God did not create love to be reciprocated."" But in all your examples, of a father or a friend or a brother or a grandmother or just a neighbor, you ignore the consequences of love which is unreturned, especially of the consequences of the one who rejects the other. You haven't addressed my counter examples, of what happens to the son who is ashamed of the father who loves him, or the man constantly embarrassed by his best friend, or the little boy who throws his grandmother's treats into the trash. The love still exists, but the results aren't positive. One person is hurt, the other is damaged. One is heartbroken, the other must train himself to ignore the pain he's just inflicted. One person is in pain, the other must learn not to care. >""So, without adequate support for your love-as-reciprocation view, I do not see any reason to agree with it."" But we only see these things through the Fall, in parts so easy to miss. We might agree, however, that if any of this were actually true, God would look for a way to show it to us through the Fall. He would want us to see, without possibility of denial, the damage such rejections do to oneself. It would behoove him, then, to create a type of Lover who defies what we can clearly see love is meant to be, a type of Lover we each are partially compelled to reject even without being prompted. A lover through even the fear of being the target of their affections compels most people to a reject them with unnatural and unwarranted vitriol, and highlight for us all to witness the damage that the experience of rejection does to a person. If God has created such a lover, and if we do in fact witness undeniably a horrible damage done to those who embrace the corresponding lover-phobia, then the Catholic view of Love holds consistent with creation. 4) The Possibility of a World Without Those who would Reject In round 2, you asserted: >""If I give you a choice between getting a million dollars and one dollar as a gift from me, I can predict that every sane person will pick the million dollars -- It's just a better choice This fact does not imply that they did not have the freedom to choose the one dollar gift, it just implies that it was obvious to everyone that a million dollars was a lot better."" >""This could be done by creating people who are rational and making it obvious that God is the most rational choice."" All of this suggests an appeal to intelligence and rationality. But now, you claim: >""Additionally, I wasn't even really trying to say that God could make us smarter to make us accept him more. Yes, you clearly were. A person is forever enslaved to his perceptions and intelligence, and if God created both Truth and Reason, then he has created the program which enslaves Mankind. This violates the concept of Free Will. The rest is of your reply is a red herring."	CON	398

With that in mind, let us explore more dying declarations from people who have touched the other side to discover and see what they have to tell us. Edward Payson, Harvard graduate, died in 1827. While lying in bed with his sister by his side: ""In a letter dictated to his sister, [Payson] writes: ""The celestial city is full in view. Its glories beam "" its breezes fan "" its odors are wafted "" its sounds strike "" and its spirit is breathed into my heart.

Solomon B. Shaw, Dying Testimonies of Saved and Unsaved. 2004. Mr. J.T. Leise recorded the dying words of his mother: ""About July 1st, of the same year she died, I got word to return home to see her die. On my arrival, I found mother very low, but having a strong faith in God. Mother""s disease was of a dropsical character. With limbs swollen, she would suffer intensely "" The morning she died, about four o""clock, a sister and I were sitting by her bed fanning her, when she suddenly opened her eyes and said, ""Children, is this death?""

"" The house was dilapidated "" the cellar was full of muddy water "" it contained no furniture, not even chairs or bedsteads, nothing but an old trunk, on which an elderly lady sat, and held in her arms a little child, almost dead "" on the floor lay another that had died but a few minutes before, and a third one was very low.

Sf4081bc4-A5b476a15	A decent god should not send people to hell for an eternity for merely not believing in him.	I believe that by the end of this you will clearly see why I have negated my opponents arguments and proved the con arguments to be true. My opponent points out every soul is important. This is true, but does not refute my argument. If every soul is important than those who could be saved and those who could not be saved stand in equal value, and since those who could be saved are substantially greater in number than those who can not be saved, you will always find god to be decent and just since he offers salvation to most.. I would like to isolate one statement my opponent makes. He asks you ton consider how many people have zero chance of following Christianity. I believe my arguments prove that number to be close to zero. This means that you will always vote con since I am the only one who actually addresses the whole of the topic and prove that god would be just to send these individuals. My opponent isolates a tiny portion of the topic and tries to win by only talking about this tiny slice of the debate. Don't allow him to do this, vote con because I address the entirety of the topic On the tribe argument, I don't believe this argument is answered well. My argument about Christian missionaries proves that Christianity has reached primitive tribes, and if they reject Christianity at this point, their damnation is just. On the argument over people of other religions, I believe that I am winning this argument as well. His argument seems to be that the chances of someone not born into the Christian faith embracing Christianity is slim. I have two response that I believe will answer this argument effectively. First, we have both agreed Christianity has spread and is known across the globe. Nearly all individuals will encounter Christianity at some point in their life, so everyone will have the chance to embrace the correct faith. Second, as long as that chance exists, then the blame still lies on the individual if they choose to not embrace god. My point over freewill solving back for most of his argument has been drastically covered, meaning you will always vote con since I have proved that free will and choice justifies damnation. As for the infant argument, there are a few things I would like to point out. The actual argument from round two was not extended through, he merely pointed out some potential flaws within my argument. I believe my argument that the infants in question would go to purgatory still stands. Even if you do not believe this, he did not extend his argument, so don't give any weight to this portion of the debate. I will answer the final argument in my summary I would like to extend my argument about free will solving back for his arguments. This argument has gone conceded, meaning that he concedes that most of the people that would fall under the resolution are justly sent to hell. By this alone I should win the round since I have prove that, on balance, god is decent and just. My opponent contends that sending innocent people to hell is bad. That is really his argument. I believe that by taking this ground, he has guaranteed you will vote con. Go back to the resolution, it speaks to ALL non believers, not just the innocent. I believe my purgatory argument and missionary argument solve for nearly all the people he discusses. Here is your choice at the end of the round. You can vote pro and affirm that sending a couple people to hell is bad, even though this does not actually support the topic put forth at the start of the debate. Or you can vote con on a few grounds, first I have addressed the entirety of the topic, second I have refuted most of my opponents arguments and proved how they are solved back, and third, I have proven that god is just in sending people non believers to hell. Even if you buy 100% of my opponents arguments, you will still vote con because I have proven that god is just in sending nearly all non believers to hell, meaning that god will always at least be mostly decent and just. You will not vote pro because you don't really know who he is discussing, he says god unjustly condemns a lot of people, but offers no evidence that I have not already refuted. You simply don't know what you are affirming if you vote pro. You are definitely not affirming the topic. For that reason alone you will vote con. Thanks for a good debate. I enjoyed it.	CON	409

Sd686be90-Af981321e	Santa Claus is Real	"I will start by rebutting your argument that Santa will not give any of those super cool awesome presents to anyone. I will simply say this is not true. He just won't give them to you because you don't believe in Santa. Santa would most definitely give all those presents to me because I have faith in Santa. By the way, I did not bring up your religion in any point of the debate. At no point did I mention your religion or god or anything. I have solely spoken of Santa Claus. You must have made those connections on your own. Now, I will explain to you using extreme scientific methods why Santa exists. I know that this information will be a lot for you to take in but here it goes. Are you ready for the truth. It's about time you learned. The whole world is in on the secret except for you. Sigh Adults buy and put the presents under the christmas tree until eventually the child discovers the truth. If the child does not discover on their own then they will eventually be told that Santa ""does not exist."" In reality he does exist. This obstacle is to test the faith of the children. To PUSH their faith in Santa to the very limits. When you turn 18 years old an adult will inform you of the real truth. The shocking truth. The truth that Santa is real and he was the one actually giving the presents the whole TIME!!!! The reason that the parents had to pretend that they were giving the presents is because Santa refuses to give teenagers presents because to often they ask for drugs and other illegal things. The only way to make teenagers not request things from Santa was by having the parents pretend that Santa wasn't real so then the teenagers would immediately assume this was true. Then, when teenagers thought that Santa wasn't real, Santa could continue to give presents to younger kids who did not ask for drugs and illegal things. All adults know of Santa's existence and they know that it is their duty to make it an easier transition for their kids when they find out that Santa is a ""Lie."" To make the transition easier the parents act extra suspicious, as if they were the ones actually giving the presents. There is a secret department in the government that controls all affairs and interactions with Santa Claus. The government knows that teens often use the internet to find information so they posted countless cites that claim that Santa is fake. They made up stories about children finding out about the big Santa ""lie"" and getting upset. Other such things to truly trick teenagers. With this system Santa Claus does not have to deal with all the drug and alcohol requests made by teenagers. To further make teenagers believe that Santa did not exist, Santa demanded that his magical elves copy the same machinery that is used in factories to make toys. This way the toys looked like they were manufactured in a factory when really they were made by the elves in Santa's workshop. This big lie has teens thinking they know the truth, but really adults and kids know the actual truth. Time for the science behind Santa. In 2004 Santa Claus accepted to be tested in a lab of science for a top secret investigation at area 51. I know because I was an intern at the time. I can not reveal too much information because I can be sent to prison for treason for revealing this information. However i am so desperate to win this information that I will reveal Santa's secrets anyway. Santa's reindeer were tested as well. First they tested Rudolf to see how he could fly. What they did was they placed the reindeer in a wind tunnel and when they cut the air surge Rudulf continued to float. I literally saw this with my own eyes. I was there. When the scientists scanned the perimeter they discovered that Rudolf used P-Waves emitted from his bright red nose to travel at a top speed of 6 billion miles per nanosecond. The P-Waves were so concentrated that it could go hyper sonic to the power of 99. This incredible validity and acceleration would surly rip Rudolf to shreds however that is not the case. We can tell from E=Mc2 that the air resistance Rudolf would feel at that speed would be the equivalent of 800 Tsar Nukes. This much friction from enertia would distort gravity to a point where time moves exactly 1 million times slower than real life. Of course this does not take into account the heat and explosive force generated. Scientists found that when gamma rays where blasted a Rudolf his fur acted as an extreme absorbent and no gamma rays escaped. This was because of his nose that shone at 80 octillion candlepower therefore all incoming disruption of atomic mass would be diluted from the light. The light was concentrated in the nose because of the immense gravity creating a black vortex that acted as an absorbent. The other rain-deer were tested to fly at the same speed however they could not do so without the guidance of Rudolf because if they flew at that speed alone they would ignite to a nebula super nova explosion due to not having a light absorber. This is the real reason Rudolf needs to lead. If he doesn't the rain deer die in a cosmic mega ton blast. Now, Santa was tested to see how it was possible for him to carry so many toys in one bag. When using uranium radiation near the bag the decay process increased dramatically. This lead to an almost full certainty that with using Newtons second law, a worm portal through time and space was the only explanation. When directed elves placed more toys in the drop compartment at the factory. These appeared in Santa's bag when needed. Now, I witnessed the scientists electrocute Santa with a series of shocks to find his ability to endure the rapid speed of particles slamming into him in the thermosphere while he sat on the back of his sled. Santa was unharmed at even the maximum level of 80 million watts. This proved that Santa could phase through electron particles at such speeds to be completely unharmed by toxic space radiation. My team and I figured out that Santa actually visits 100 houses a night meaning that one christmas night took Santa 277 years of gift giving. With time slowed down Santa can enter a house in real time and with Rudolf nearby his gravitational ionic force keep the realtime in actual in a time so slow for the rest of the world that an example would be for every month that passed for Santa would be the equivalent of 2.22 seconds for the world. The next scientific feat was find out how Santa and the rain deer could focus for 277 years in order to complete one christmas voyage. We tested Santa in a both where he had to decipher the order of pitch sounds of a sound the went of at 157 bps and he had to order the sizes of dots that appeared on a screen at 30 frames per second. Santa easily completely both these tasks at the same time with 100% accuracy. This proves absolute control over nerve functions and this could be verified when we scanned Santa's brain. Lastly we tested the materials the elves in the factory used to never corrode for so many years. We new that Santa's sleigh was made of Neuron Nova hardened Carbon Alloy and they deflected heat to stay in shape. However in the north pole this type of allow would become brittle and crack under the cold as the particles slowed to a crawl. We tested and saw that the elves used diamond machines that were laces through every particles with calcium-flouride a mixture of bone and fluoride. This type of material could last forever in the North Pole. After these tests we escorted Santa from are 51 and now he goes back to his usual job of giving kids presents."	PRO	412
Sdf849491-A24b5aa85	Why GOD is real	"You say that the United States of America was built on God. I disagree. I say that our country was built upon the backs of thousands of people, who wanted a new life, and new opportunities. They labored hard for hundreds of years, became independent from their mother countries, and in time, had a revolution. America was built on opportunity, and the prospect of freedom. As far as how life began, I'd like to introduce the concept of the Big Bang. While scientists everywhere are still trying to iron out the details of this theory, it is certainly a better creation story than that of an omnipresent being. We know from basic physics that something cannot be created out of nothing. If everything started with God, than where did God come from? Was there another God, more powerful than Him? If that is so, than where did the other one come from? There are too many unanswerable questions when it comes to the Creation myth. Unfortunately I do not actually own a Bible, so I cannot read and gather 'research' from it, as you suggest. However, I do believe that the Bible is a rather biased source as far as this debate goes. It's only evidence of God is anecdotal stories written thousands of years ago. If these stories are true, than why not the Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Norse, etc. gods of myth? There is just as much 'evidence' for these stories as there are for God. I can do you one better than research from the Bible. Logical thinking is all that is needed to disprove God. Take the story of Noah's Arc, for example. If a flood of such great proportions, enough to cover the entire Earth (which would include Mount Everest, a mountain over six miles tall), actually did happen, then there would surely be some evidence for that! Where are the geological, archaeological, and glacial evidence? And, if every animal on the Earth today came from a singular pair of animals aboard the (what must have been an insanely large vessel) then there would have to be a complicated genetic code to point to that. While I'm tempted to ignore the part where you basically told me I'm going to Hell, I'm going to refute that as well. Without wishing to sound arrogant, I've lived a good fifteen years. I'm kind to everyone that I meet, and I work hard every day to excel in my studies. I don't judge if someone has a different opinion than myself, because I believe everyone has the right to have their own opinion, including on the topic that we are currently debating about. I volunteer at hospitals, schools, and day cares. I always say my 'pleases' and 'thank yous.' Essentially, I've done everything that the sacred Ten Commandments tell us to do, with one exception. I do not believe in God or go to church. You're telling me, that simply because I do not believe in God, I should suffer eternal punishment? Is there no other way to save my soul? If it was truly so important for every single person to believe in Him, than why doesn't He descend from the heavens and give us some real proof? Even if God was real, I certainly would not want to worship someone so cruel. Just take a look at all the people he would have killed: ""For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death."" Exodus 35:2 Have to work on Sunday? Oh well, we're going to have to kill you for it. ""If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid."" Deut 21:18-21 Pretty much every teenager. Gone. ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood is upon them."" Leviticus 20:13 Oh, you're gay? Oops, sorry, we have to throw stones at you until you bleed to death. ""If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbour, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death."" Yeah, you cheated on your wife. Not cool, but is it really an awful enough crime to deserve the death penalty? And even if it was, why do mere mortals have to do God's dirty work? Couldn't God just kill them himself? No, because he does not exist. Source: http://godisimaginary.com..."	CON	413
S224da923-Aca3d9034	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"1- First of all this debate is discussing which team is between Barcelona and Madrid is currently better. As you know 2008 was the year when Barcelona won 6 trophies for different leagues in that year, what it has to do with what's going on currently is that 2008 was the year both teams began to experience change. The reason I began with the several leagues that both real Madrid and Barcelona competed in was to show where each ranked during those times. It may be true that real Madrid is currently 5 points ahead in la liga and they won every single match against other teams they still haven't beaten Barcelona even once. 2009 was the year where they only obtained one trophy but they did hell of a lot better than Madrid. I can care less the difference in goals because the amount of goals a team scores is not important unless they tie in points. Its true that 5 European cups in a row is good but it was achieved on a yearly bases rather than winning several competitions in one year which is impressive because Barcelona endured a whole lot of pressure because winning league after league in the same year must have made them exhausted. With that said they had the skill to move past that and win 6 consecutive cups/leagues proving they are the best. 2- I don't quite understand what you mean by ""Over the 5 past La Liga seasons Real Madrid's point total has been 7 points higher than that of Barcelona."" because this league was owned by Barcelona 2008-2009, 2009-2010, 2010-2011. so its impossible for them to have beaten Barcelona by seven points for 5 years when the latest three years have been one by Barcelona. Now about those last five games, its true that Madrid won one of the matches but honestly that goal was the only one they could get and on top of that they fouled a lot and proof of that was that di Maria got a red card and 5 other members had yellow card. The match had been 0-0 and entered extra time Barcelona as I remember had more positioning of the ball and had much more shots on the real Madrid's goal. Barcelona played much better than real Madrid but in the first half of extra time both teams tired and Barcelona team was a hurt due to earlier fouls and Madrid was able to score a goal due to the circumstances( http://goalzz.com...) . overall it was good but Madrid didn't play honorably. another case of that would be their last match 2-2. the game started interesting first half both side playing fair and was exciting because both side had the chance of scoring the first goal and out of nowhere Barcelona scores 2 goals I admit Barcelona had more position of the ball and passed the ball to each other in sync form and earned those 2 goals. In the second half things get ugly when the dam team of Madrid start fouling the hell out of Barcelona even though in the first half Madrid fouled a Barcelona player in the penalty area (http://goalzz.com...) if u look at this link you should see the amount of yellow cards that has been given to the team of Madrid. All I have to say about the second half is that it wasn't the usual soccer match but Benzima did have a very nice goal. Real Madrid isn't better than Barcelona for many reason and this match proves it. This match and its previous were added together and the outcome that came was Barcelona had advanced because they won both matches and that tie was their win 4-3. 3- the only reason ronaldo scored more goals is because he doesn't know how to do anything else. messi on the other hand is much better at technique, the ability to create an opportunity to score goals and the way he passes the balls to his team mates. Messi could score all those shots by himself and beat ronaldo at his own game but he sees an opportunity for a goal and takes it. this video shows how he goes through 4 players (http://www.youtube.com...) Messi easily moves past players and always seems to assist in the goals. so between messi and ronaldo Messi creates more opportunities for a goal and has the most assists a player can have. Maybe that can answer your question about the goals. messi always passes the ball to his team mates in a way they score goals. this shows that he can score, always assists and has less goals because unlike ronaldo who receives the pass to score a goal messi makes that pass. Players who can successfully do that are much better at the game than those who only wait for an opportunity to come toward them. 4- depending on how people will look at this argument depends on whether or not they cheer Barcelona or Madrid or which player they like more. Just so you know I'm a Madrid fan but I'm just stating the true facts. Madrid currently are as good as they were when zidan was still playing. They play much rougher and aren't in sync as they use to be. They pass, they go for the win but its not the same as Barcelona. The fact still remains that real Madrid needs to start playing more as a team than separate players. Also against Barcelona they can easily score goals but usually after they score the first goal they go to defense which is a problem because they are giving more opportunity for Barcelona to score. If we look at the true hard facts between both teams Barcelona is currently better."	PRO	414

Sa2c55bd3-A9f889d80	God is not real	"I would like to point out that all of my opponents arguments are founded upon the assumption that the Christian God exists. Such arguments must be thrown out as that is the topic that we are debating: ""Is God real?"" Nevertheless, I will refute the points that my opponent has brought up ~Different interpretations of morality~ ""There is no reason to claim that we know the morality of this God, and so in his eyes any 'unjust' thing may be completely just"". This is completely irrelevant. We may not know the 'morality' of strangers yet we still understand what is 'bad' or 'good'. While I must agree with my opponent on the fact that 'good' and 'bad' are both subjective terms, it can not be argued that mass genocide (Noah's Ark) is most definitely not the actions of a 'good' or benevolent God. ~We can't understand what God is thinking~ The argument that we as humans cannot comprehend the greatness that is God should be thrown out as it is what is considered as an 'escape hatch' argument. Such an argument is irrefutable because as of now humanity can not even confirm if a God exists let alone understand what this God's plan is. ~We can understand the Bible~ How can a Christian not understand the Bible, God's own words illustrating his plan for humanity? The answer to this question is: they can't. The Bible is perfectly understandable as it was designed to be understood by humans in order to understand God's master 'plan'. Moreover, you concede the point that the Bible has inconsistencies. However, you say that this is due to the fact that the Bible was written by humans and humans make errors. This point is also completely irrelevant. It does not matter who or what wrote the actual Bible because the Bible contains God's own words. Wouldn't an omniscient God make sure to proofread what his followers have written to ensure everything is 100% accurate? If you answered no to that question then you just contradicted yourself. If the Bible is not 100% accurate then you are using the Lord's name in vain which is forbidden by the Ten Commandments. ~Religion is NOT based on interpretation~ Religion is humanity living out God's plan. God only had one plan, thus any ""interpretations"" of Christianity that are a derivative from God's original plan can be considered as blasphemous. God's word is not open to interpretation as doing so would place you on a higher pedestal than God hereby removing this entity's title of ""God"". ~A tyrannical God does mean he does not exist~ The Bible consistently tells us that the Lord 'loves' us and only wants the best for us. We must assume that the Bible is 100% true due to the reason stated above. If this god acts in a tyrannical or evil way in any manner, we must assume that this God is not real or at least not as the Bible describes him."	PRO	421

Sd686be90-A2e79d5be	Santa Claus is Real	"You will not decimate God, you merely will decimate yourself. You are digging your own grave. You have rebutted my Rebuttal with rebuts that I have already rebutted. (I <3 tongue twisters) ""Count yourself lucky..."" I've a feeling this is a lie. Btw (by the way) the work on this Debate.org saves, so even if you don't have internet connection, it will still save your work. You have used my words wrongly, ""I even ended with the line, ""It is time to accept the cruel reality, and not live in the idyllic reality that you believed in, and continuously deceive yourself. That reality will be shattered, broken by me."" - a quote by yourself."" I have accepted the cruel reality, it is not you that hasn't. 1. God will not do anything you ask. And no one wants to destroy the 7 Wonders of the World, except you. You don't rebut my statement with a question. You've got the Bible all wrong, as usual. He is not under much obligation to reply to our wishes. 2. God indeed doesn't need prayers. Prayers is just something we Christians do, to acknowledge God, to attain his blessing, to communicate to him, and gain wisdom. God did not request Prayers. 3. You are replying my statements with regards to Christianity. God does not need to answer prayers 100% of the time, but he is always listening. ""Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. But your iniquities have separated you from your God. Your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.""3"" He ignores us, because we are sinful, or we doubt him, or we do not believe in him. Sin has separated us from him. He is pure and hates Sin, which is why sometimes God does not answer our Prayers. Link: http://www.everystudent.com... 4. God has already proved his existence. Also, God has no need to prove his existence. He does not need to prevent Atheists from burning in hell. I have already answered this rebuttal. Please, open your eyes. ""God however, has use for Angels and Humans. He balances everything. He makes the Dark, he creates the Light. He kills, and resurrects. He makes the rich, he creates the poor."" God is the ultimate arbiter and adjudicator. He does not need to prevent sinful people from burning in hell and getting thrown into Gehenna. 5. God's thinking is not flawed. God created an idyllic, perfect, flawless world for us. But nooo. We humans had to go and Sin, and allow evil in this world. There are 2 types of Evil: Natural Evil: Disasters, Catastrophe, Tornado, Earthquakes, etc. Moral Evil: You can guess. This destroyed God's creation, and he couldn't do anything about it. Because he took a gamble, and allowed us to have free will. We abused it, and now he cannot do anything to help us. We allowed starvation. God is not to blame. God is not to blame for any Sin, we *are Sinful*. 7. God always has a plan, and a great one. There are many points to prove that, just like Jesus's act of dying on the cross. From the prediction in the Bible that predicted Jesus's coming 2500 years beforehand, it clearly shows that The Plan of Salvation was already planned. 8. God is pure, and he can do anything in this world, except for anything that is contrary to his nature. (Sinning) We are Sinful, we do not deserve his omniscience. God has abandoned us multiple amounts of times in the Bible, and we made him so angry that at times, *""the lord did not even spare his own house in his anger""*. God has literally destroyed every single one of the altars or covenants or temples that Israel once had, (In the Bible) and has allowed its enemies to pillage, slaughter his own people, the people that he had chosen. He has allowed mass genocide, and has killed numerous amounts of people, to the extent that it is possibly beyond the calculations of Mathematics. God has killed more than billions. The Bible also states that God killed all the people on the Earth once (except for Moses). Sin does not apply to God, as whatever God does, he cannot Sin. The Bible states so. The word and definition of ""Sin"" does not even apply to an omnipotent being like him. Santa, however, is not omnipotent nor omniscient, (except in the context of your argument, which I rebutted already) and thus, he *CAN* Sin. 9. I would say, indeed, for a fact that I would believe in Santa, in the context that everyone in the world worshipped Santa except for about 2% of the population. However, nobody in the world worships Santa except for you. This is Reality. Btw, I would get thrown into Gehenna, into the River of Fire for worshipping an Idol. I would get punished, severely, for worshipping Santa. Your main argument is stupid. I shall now destroy your main argument. There is not sufficient evidence to state the Existence of Santa. Scientifically, Santa does not exist. You stated scientifically about how Santa and his reindeer worked, (and I applaud you for that bullcrap) but the science part was based on the claim that you visited Area 51, which is not believable, and not backed up by any evidence. God is proven scientifically, from a single tiny strand of DNA to the measurement of plants and music, and most of all, nature. Logically and Scientifically, God is real. There is an ultimate Designer of this Universe, it is just which one. And theoretically, logically, God exists. There is no evidence of Santa. Most of your rebuttals are on the premise that you assume that Santa is real, while you do not have any evidence to state that fact. Which is why most of your rebuttals are originally not meant to be rebutted, but as kindhearted as I am, I did rebut. This Debate has been stupid, especially as my opponent himself is stupid. He thinks that making up all these lies and claims, that are based on no evidence will help him win this Debate. By proof, I mean legitimate proof. Most of your ""evidence"" is fake, false, and a lie. (claims) ""The Babble states that... 10 commandments..."" Bullcrap, Santa does not have 10 commandments and a Babble. Get actual evidence. This is one of the rebuttals which I have posted last round. You still have not rebutted it. Just saying, ""I lost my work"" is not an actual excuse. I win, tejretics is back. He isn't stupid like you, and will most likely vote for the better Debater. I believe in God, because he has concrete, scientific evidence, while Santa does not. *NOTE THAT ""****"" MEANS PRO HAS NOT REBUTTED, AND ""*"" MEANS THAT I HAVE REBUTTED THE STATEMENT!* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rebuttals: -Wikipedia, and almost all links related to Santa states that Santa is false, fake, and a lie.

You can't retract your statement. You have made a serious blunder."" -God is real, proven scientifically, historically, logically, is a widely held belief, and in my case, a fact.

Get better concrete, hard, evidence. ""I have solid evidence behind the existence of Santa"". Don't make me laugh.**** (Not rebutted) -He answers ""at least 90% of the time"". What is with that ""at least"" and ""90%""? Santa is, according to your statements and claims, omnipotent. He can answer 100% of the time.* (Rebutted your rebut) - If Santa was indeed omniscient and omnipotent, he would not need anybody to catch him on a mere technological device (that is, a camera). Neither will he need a child to catch him putting presents below the Christmas Tree. It is hardly evidence and illogical. Santa would wanting to be on tape is pure crap.* (Rebutted your rebut) -You yourself admit that Santa's thinking is flawed. Isn't this strange? Starvation. Hunger. Tragedy. Overpopulation. Santa does not solve these problems, instead he gives out presents to kids. (Rebutted your rebut) -""Santa is helpful to everyone and uses his immense power very wisely."" You usually say a sentence like this when you have a limited/finite amount of power. But remember, Santa is ""omnipotent"". So he does not have to use his immense power very wisely. Santa does not have a great plan. The more I read, the more you blasphemy.**** (Not rebutted) -There is no such definition of ""Babble"". In your context, you state that this ""Babble"" is a book. Allow me to show you: Babble: talk rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way. Somehow, it admittedly suits you.**** (Not rebutted) -You have no evidence, concrete or not, to support your claims. Do you not understand? -There is a serious flaw in this. Santa has no use for any servants, yet he has elves to make toys when he could materialise them out of thin air.* (Rebutted your rebut) -Elves have higher technology than Humans, but the toys are still the same.* (Rebutted your rebut) Dear Readers, note that there are more statements that Pro has not rebutted.

S5732ba4d-Ae42c9a44	Is This life what you think it is? Hell if you see life wrong maybe the place you end up.	"Thank you, read this carefully It may change you? Hell! Through out history it has been thought of as the most foolish and regretful place to end up out of the whole existence of everything. If I was confronted with a slight possibility of a place like this where you end up after your ""first death"" I would consider to think about the wording of ""what if and ""if only"". Although there is no proof in the physical world that such a please existence. It would be wise to try and understand the strange spiritual world. By finding out if God does actually exist or not by close (not skeptical) examination of God's ever lasting love. By saying ""I know what love feels like, so why do I need God's love?"" I will answer.... ""All love is from God even from other people as it hell there is no love, and all the love you feel now is spiritual love."" As science can not excitement with love emotions. It could be possible to decrease or increase the amount of love you feel. But not get rid of it, this occurs naturally anyway, when you injure emotions. There is no such thing as a emotion with no love. You may think hate is a emotion with no love. But you only truly really feel bad emotions in hell. As there is no God to offer good emotions. (God will be none existent to you in hell) Likewise you may blame God for curtin emotions, but God is actually the one not to blame since He is giving all the love He can to you but you simply reject it by blaming God. Hell is a place where you know all the sins which appeared good turn out to be evil and corrupt, Jesus said ""Turn from your sins now"" Jesus did not say that to spoil your enjoyment but to give you ever lasting enjoyment. Love is enjoyable, enjoyment is love-able. Sin is selfish, selfish is sin. Example: Getting into a drunken state leads to bad atmosphere, making it unconformable, disrespectful and insecure. But you are having fun. No? By not getting drunk will allow you to see clearly at the foolishness which occurs. Get drunk in the Holy Spirit and you can see what is foolish. Even one sin will, even if you steal a paper clip. God sees material thing unworthy of heaven, so what you still is not the point, It is the very thought of making the thought come true. Even by taking a paper clip will make you injure endless suffering and pain in hell. If I mention the ""not so good"" news, I must give you the good. Jesus Christ can save you from hell if you trust in him by giving your sins to Him. As Jesus lived a perfect life He should of lived but instead God decided to make Him Son injure instead. So you selfish people (including me) can have ever lasting life. From DE's, people have said hell seems more real than this life and having no sense of the time. Once in hell you will see a faint bright light which contained all the love aviaible to you in heaven, But instead you having it God rejects you like you rejected Jesus Christ. Making a perfect man die for nothing. If you were the only person Jesus could die for on earth Jesus would still have died for you! Yet every time you sin it is like spitting in His face. If you sin once a day that's spitting 3550 times in Jesus' face for 10 years. If you sin 10 times a day that's 35500 times in 10 years. And that's only one person. It seems people forget Jesus was perfect. And they (sinners) are not. As a child you believe in Santa Claus? Most children do. You enjoyed the fact that Santa was a cheerful man, who deserved to give gifts to your children. (If you are a parent you get no credit for Christmas when you have young children as Santa does all the work) You as a Child are born enjoying Christmas every year believe that Santa will come into your house (If Santa was to visit ever house in one night, He would have to spend a 1 millionth of a second at each house) Moving that fast is supernatural. Like the devil who hides, it would be impossible for the eye to see Santa as your eye can only see a maximum of a 20th of a second. So Santa is the devils way for bring in the children into the Physical world (mentioned in my other debate, ""Randomness is a lack of knowledge in the Spiritual and Physical world"") As a Child the Devil acts like the child is in control by doing nothing on Christmas and the devil (now known to me as Santa) has the burden of running about after presents. When you Grow older you become the devils slave as you do not believe in Santa and therefore the devil anymore. Making your life style converted by physical not spiritual beliefs. And now as a adult with money ""You can not serve two masters, money and God."" is more avaible, again more involved in the physical world. So now the burden is on you to run into shops buying gifts you are now the devils slave who has seemed to have disappeared as quickly as Santa did, therefore God disappears from the picture altogether. If one tells you of God you are skepticial (examin closer) The trap is hell and if you are still a sinner you will go there unless you trust in Jesus (spiritual) and confess you are a evil person in a physical world.

I have just read your words, you might offended from what you have seen: from gay priest and failures of other religions. Do not assumed these things as a part of God's real church. We cannot judge the quality of a school from the attitude of some bad students. Evidences regarding the accounts of JESUS after his death and resurrection, including the books written by his disciples were destroyed by the Jewish and Romans. Early REAL Christians were suffered from tortures, fed to lions and brutal killings. (Source: Hebrews 11:37). Some of them who survived are scattered around the world. The next batch of Christians (The real born again christians) were also killed by the Nazi ordered by the Roman Catholic popes. Bibles were burned. And anyone who opposed the Catholic religion were put to death. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org...) Even the late pope John Paul say sorry about the mass killing committed by their previous popes. (Source: http://thescotsman.scotsman.com...) All I can say, all these things were made by the DEVIL. He wants all proofs of God existence to disappear. Regarding Satan, ofcourse GOD can destroy Satan anytime He wants. You should know that Satan was one of God's best angels. (Ezekiel 28 & Isaiah 14) But one day he rebelled from God, and 1/3 of God's angels were convinced and brainwashed by him. (Revelation 12:4) These angels become his armies. We do not know everything about the rebellion and accusation of Satan to GOD. God might not kill Satan for the sake of fairness, for the sake of his faithful angels ,and for the sake of Satan's accusation to GOD. Anyway Satan is bound for destruction and punishment after the 2nd coming of Christ. Since you are looking for a good evidence of GOD existence. I want to share how GOD moves from our Church. We have thousands of living testimonies that shows the greatness of GOD. The bible speaks of a sign of GOD's real church: (Mark 16:17-18) ~ And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. (Matthew 10:8) ~ Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. I am so blessed to become a part of GOD's real church ~ JESUS MIRACLE CRUSADE INTERNATIONAL MINISTRY How can you explain a clinically dead people brings back to life thru prayers? Some of them have received a death certificate from the hospital. Only GOD can raise a dead person it cannot be imitate by Satan. (John 11:25). We have thousand of church members healed from incurable diseases such as LEPROSY, CANCER, AIDS, PSORIASIS and other sicknesses WITHOUT USING MEDICINE or MEDICAL operation. We were all healed thru prayers. The bible says no weapon can destroy a true children of GOD. (Isaiah 54:17). We have church brethrens being shot by a gun but nothing happened. We have homesexual brethrens and now become a real man and woman. ( Source: http://www.jmcim.org... ) In year 2000 our pastor Wilde Almeda with 12 church preachers goes to the camp of muslim rebels in Talipao Jolo Sulu, Philippines to rescue 21 foreign hostages. These rebels were convinced and amazed because their highpowered guns and swords did not penerate from our pastor and to our church preachers. All foreign hostages were rescued! (Source: http://www.jmcim.org... ) GOD will reveal only his power to those who fully trust him and do his will. The TRUE CHURCH of GOD is packed with tremendous signs and wonders, and with divers miracles. GOD is real, and he is the same yesterday and tomorrow . He doesnt change.	PRO	427

Sd686be90-Af952c788	Santa Claus is Real	I will be debating that Santa Claus is real. When I was young my parents told me all about Santa Claus and his magical miracles and stuff. He is so kind to bring presents to everyone. When I was six years old my parents gave me a book about Santa Claus. I remember how I used to write my wish list and send it off to Santa and he would always respond to my every request with the presents I asked for. The book about Santa said that Santa will do whatever you ask in his name, and will bring toys and stuff. One day my parents said that Santa was not real. I am really upset now because I know that Santa is real so why are they trying to tell me that he is not. I know he is real because I have a book about Santa and the book is the word of Santa. I am sure that the book is the word of Santa because the it says so right in the book. And the book is infallible because it is the word of Santa. And I know it is the word of Santa because it says so in the book. Anyway, now everyone is trying to tell me that Santa is not real but obviously he is. In the book it says that all nonbelievers will get coal, but if you believe in Santa you will get presents. My friends have tried to convert me to believing in other magical beings such as the tooth fairy and the easter bunny but I know that these are all fake. It's so dumb that they believe in those things. I mean seriously, obviously Santa is the one true magical being. My friends are trying to tell me that if I don't believe in the tooth fairy then I won't get money and if I don't believe in the easter bunny then I won't get a chocolate bunny, but I tried to use logic and reasoning to convince them that they won't get presents if they don't believe in Santa. Then I got my other friends that believe in Santa and I fought against my other friends that believe in their magical beings. I am very mad that people are attacking my beliefs about Santa.

Before my beginning argument, I feel it is important to talk about the study of metaphysics. The prefix ""Meta"", meaning ""beyond"" and the word ""Physical"", meaning ""That which is material"". Metaphysics is a fundamental branch of philosophy that looks at the nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Thing's like ideas, opinions, and thought are all considered to metaphysical.

Most people for some reason are incapable of arguing with me on this site without trying to degrade and insult me. I can't disagree with anything the Bible holds true. The Bible does specifically adress certain types of antagonistic behaviour and does call people names according to their behaviour. Since you are showing me a measure of respect, I will not point out the names in the Bible that would apply to you based on the things you have stated in your arguments. For this debate, the only name I have for you is the same name that applies to me, Ghandi, Hitler, Muhammed, Mother Tersea, Bhudda, and every other person who has ever breathed God's air (atheist's too, it's still God's air if they admit it or not): sinner. All of your questions and objections have been answered. If I say more, I'll be repeating myself. For this round, I will only ask you to look more carefully at the questions and statements you are making and the answers I gave. You are repeating your questions and statement. I don't want to repeat my answers. If you didn't accept them the first time, yoiu will not accept them by me repeating them now. Scroll back and look. All of your questions and statements were answered. You are not accepting the answers. You can understand God if you try. All you are doing is trying to justify your existence outside of the fire of Hell. It's not possible to justify your existence outside of the fire of Hell if you are not justified by God Himself in the death, burial, and resurrection of God the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ our Messiah and our King.

S3a7cba7f-A9b557b66	Evolution is real.	"Evolution is, overall, a well proven theory. Before we officially begin, a ""theory"" is defined as ""a re-proven and reiterated idea."" In fact, evolution is one of the most well formulated theories in all of science. Anyway, why it is real: Chimpanzees/monkeys and other primates have had close genetic similarities and behaviors as many humans. Also, many systems of the human anatomy work virtually the same. For instance, humans have been proven to have the strongest immunities of all living beings. And what living being comes next on the list? Chimpanzees. That is because of evolution; The Immune System has become stronger as evolution has progressed. We'll go into depth once you accept."	PRO	434

Given, I think, by how you made your argument. Death is separation from God caused... the law does not bring punishment. Right, we are all lawbreakers at some point. You are correct when you say lawbreakers ""deserve"" to be punished. What kind of punishment though? You seem to think that eternal and infinite suffering is a just penalty for ""the tiniest"" lie. I would be horrified if that was the logic humans used. Should we torture to death anyone who breaks the speed limit? There are things such as just and unjust punishments, and it is ludicrous to think that infinite suffering is a just penalty for a finite, minor transgression. God does not want... He created to enjoy. You're honestly telling me that an omniscient and omnipotent entity has to fear ""rebellion""? Why would God want to forever go... separted from God forever because of our sin.. Well, if God was so adverse to ""heartache"", I don't know why he would create creatures that had such a capacity for sin. Non sequitur. Why must there be an eternal separation between God and his creatures given his not wanting ""heartache""? He could just separate the ones who say his law is good and ones who say his law is bad. You know, like the Bible says. Heaven vs hell and all. Right, God didn't have to create us. He did create us, though. I would think that he wouldn't send to eternal suffering and cause himself ""heartache"" humans if he bothered to create us in the first place. That probably isn't his intention. Okay, many points in here for rebels to argue... enough to pull them back from death to life. Or maybe you could lose because your arguments aren't as good?"	CON	435

S74fdcbb5-Afaf8ed57	God Is Not Real	"I am honestly quite confused since the argument my opponent has posted has nothing to do with disproving the existence of God. The argument is merely just questions about the existence of God. That said, I will present some arguments and then respond to what was written. Part One- The Cosmological argument: a. Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence. Defense: It is impossible for something to come from nothing. Therefore it is logical to say that everything that begins to exist has a cause. This premise is common sense. b. The universe began to exist. Defense: The second law of thermodynamics lets us know that the universe is running out of usable energy (hence heading towards a heat death). In an eternal universe, it would have run out of energy by now. So since this hasn't happened, we know that the Universe had a beginning (since it is not eternal). Also, there is the discovery of red-shift in 1929. Basically, this discovery showed us that the universe is expanding which means if you were to go back in time, the universe would shrink and shrink. William Lane Craig says it better, he states that ""as one traces the expansion back in time, the universe becomes denser and denser until one reaches a point of infinite density from which the universe began to expand."" So basically, modern science supports that the Universe began to exist. c. Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence. Defense: Since everything that begins to exist has a cause, and because the universe began to exist, the universe must have had a cause. d. Since the cause of the Universe has to be.... Eternal-the cause of the universe led to the existence of time. Omnipresent-the cause of the universe led to the existence of space. Omnipotent-the cause of the universe led to the existence of everything. Moral-the cause of the universe led to the existence of morality Personal-William Lane Craig states that ""the cause of the universe must be an ultramundane being which transcends space and time and is therefore either an unembodied mind or an abstract object; it cannot be the latter; hence, it must be the former, which is to say that this being is personal"" (http://www.reasonablefaith.org......). Therefore, the cause of the Universe must be God since he is all of those things. Nothing else is all of those things that the cause is. So God is the best explanation for why the Universe exists. The Existence of Jesus: Almost all scholars in our age believe that Jesus was a real person (http://www.is-there-a-god.info...). There are many ancient historians (https://www.google.com...) that have written about him and we even have writings from the people that knew Jesus (The New Testament). You should have no doubt that Jesus was a real person. The famous historian Josephus for example stated that ""Jesus was a wise teacher who was crucified by Pontius Pilate"" In other words, we also have proof that Jesus was crucified. The Bible affirms all of this and even explains why Jesus' body went missing from the empty tomb. More on that later... Jesus claimed to be God and his friends and his brothers claimed that he was God. Josephus tells us that Jesus was a good teacher. But it is a mistake to believe that Jesus was only a good teacher. C.S. Lewis stated that ""is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg; or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the son of God: or else a madman or something worse."" People of the time period indicate that Jesus was a good person and a good teacher...but you can't be these things if you are insane. Lets go back to the empty tomb. The historian Luke states (chapter 24) that the tomb was found empty by women. How did this happen? The best explanation(http://www.reasonablefaith.org.........) is that Jesus was who he said he was and did in fact rise from the dead. People might claim that Jesus never died but this is silly considering that we know he was crucified and that he was buried. No one could survive that process. Others claim that the body never went missing which is ridiculous considering the Romans and the Jews could have merely shown Christians the body and then their faith would be destroyed. And on top of that, there are people such as the New Testament writers that claim they along with 500 other people saw Jesus after his death. Even the brothers of Jesus (who previously disbelieved in the deity of their brother) came to believe that Jesus was God. Think about that for a moment...what would it take for you to believe that your brother (if you have one) was God? Would it take a resurrection? Nevertheless they became Christians. Since we have good evidence that Jesus was resurrected, and since only a God can do this, and since Jesus claimed to be God (John 10:30), it is true that the Christian God is the one that exists. Part Two- My opponent starts off his argument by saying ""God's logic is exceptionally flawed. If God 'intelligently designs' each human, in his own image, why does he decide to make people gay?"" My response is that my opponent has made a bare assertion and they need to support what they say. In other words, prove that people are born gay before you make claims like that. Then my opponent states that praying is pointless because God decides when we die according to Psalm 139:16. This argument makes no sense at all. Prayer is the act of talking to God and the Bible verse only says that God knows when we are going to die. That said, why would our eventual death prevent us from talking to God? So my opponent has to explain this before any progress in the conversation can be made. Then my opponent states that ""Design, in nature, is unintelligent."" No one would claim that that design is intelligent. That said, I would say that the designer was intelligent. As for the question about the larynx, I guess God was using his creativity when creating giraffes. Or maybe this helps the giraffe in some way (with eating). I really don't know. But honestly, I am surprised that my opponent brought this up since the supposed evolution of the giraffe is a huge problem for evolutionists. Apparently, no evidence has been found to support the evolution of giraffes. The most common explanation for the giraffes long neck is that natural selection helped the giraffe eat food on talk trees. But the problem is that ""we now know acquired characteristics are not inherited"" (https://creation.com...). So...evolutionists have a lot of explaining to do. My opponent then asserts (without evidence) that evolution is not incompatible with intelligent design. Many people like Michael Behe would disagree with him on that. That said, I happen to agree with my opponent so I will not press the issue. Then my opponent makes another bare assertion that ""evolution is a proven theory unlike the existence of God"". I don't even know where to start on this point. First of all, if it were proven, then it wouldn't be a theory. Second of all, if by evolution my opponent means that organisms adapt and descend from other organisms, then that is a fact. But if my opponent is referring to common ancestry or that humans came from apes, then that is not even close to being considered a fact. Lastly, my opponent leaves us with three more bare assertions which are as follows: ""there is no scientific evidence of God. God has never left any proof of his existence, nor did Jesus leave any proof of his miracles."" I have just shown that cosmology is evidence for the existence of God. I could go into mathematics and into fine tuning but I like to limit the amount of arguments I use for God's existence. As for the miracles of Jesus, we just so happen to have eye witness accounts of the miracles he preformed. Read the gospels for more details. Speaking of eye witness accounts, they claim that Jesus is eternal (John 1:1-5), Omnipresent (Matthew 18:20), Omnipotent (John 11:38-44), Moral (kind of obvious...but Matthew 5), and Personal (spent his life ministering to people). So Jesus according to the people that knew him does in fact satisfy the requirements in order to the the cause of the universe. In conclusion, my opponent has not provided a single argument against the existence of God but has merely asked questions. I on the other hand have provided two strong arguments for the existence of the Christians God and have responded to everything my opponent has written. I now await for my opponent's next response."

Sa38ca994-Aeaf27cc6	The Five-Second Rule is Real	I apologize if any of this seems disjointed, the debate setup does not call for rebuttals until next round; I am therefore abstaining from reading con’s case until then. To open I shall first provide the requested dictionary definitions, then I shall lay out a two tiered argument based on the most likely interpretations. Definitions: From UrbanDictionary.com… The Five Second Rule’s most approved definition (85.5% like it) is “A simple rule stating that food dropped on the ground is still perfectly edible if it is picked up in five seconds. Ingeniously created by guys for the sole purpose of reducing wasted food and allowing a person that second chance they needed to enjoy their food” [1]. The 5 Second Rule is “An unwritten law dictating that if a food or other consumable item is dropped onto the floor, it may be picked up up and eaten within five seconds” [2]. From Merriam-Webster.com (my preferred dictionary, which lacked the Five Second Rule)… Rule is “a prescribed guide for conduct or action,” or “an accepted procedure, custom, or habit” [3]. Real is “important and deserving to be regarded or treated in a serious way,” however as that definition is overly favorable it may be best to look at the origin of the word “Middle English, real, relating to things (in law) … First Known Use: 14th century” [4]. Arguments: The Five Second Rule is Real… If something is real, has nothing to do with if people should follow it. Slavery was very real, people should not have owned slaves, yet still did (and continue to in many parts of the world). Honey Boo Boo is real, so are Child Protective Services; yet the latter is shown to be lacking by the former, yet this ineffectiveness does not lead to the conclusion of one not being real. Pertaining to the Five Second Rule, it is a popular tradition among both men and women, surprisingly similar to the Three Second and Ten Second rules (all are likely variants from one origin, which the chief of the division of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medical College Dr. Roy M. Gulick, states “the five-second rule probably should become the zero-second rule,” [5]). The rule is intelligently designed to decrease the level of exposure to harmful bacteria, much like how milk can be transported home unrefrigerated with no harmful effects, whereas left in the car overnight it is no longer safe. Of course the degree to which it is followed, closely relates to the desirability of the food in question; furthered weighted against the cleanliness of the surface touched. There are no known cases of it being employed in a bathroom, or of Jell-O being slurped up until five seconds has been reached. In 2003 the nutrition department at the University of Illinois conducted a Nobel Prize winning study. Taking swabs of the floors in the lab, hall, dorms, and even the cafeteria; they found very few microorganisms, then repeated it to the same result and concluded “the floors were so clean, from a microbiological point of view, because floors are dry, and most pathogens like salmonella, listeria, or E. coli can't survive without moisture.” Finally to get the desired results, they intentionally covered tiles in large amounts of E. coli which had some transference [6]. The study strongly implies a normal dry floor is safe, however someone can intentionally transfer E. coli; but if someone is trying to poison you, I have a hard time imagining them targeting the floor instead of the food directly. However a 2007 Connecticut College study looked closely at the non-manipulated results, then conducted a more realistic study. Dropping a dry food and a moist food in various dining locations around campus, it was concluded “no bacteria were present on the foods that had remained on the floor for five, ten, or thirty seconds” [5], the 300 seconds being another matter. These findings support the initial (pre lab introduced E. coli) conclusion of the 2003 study. The Five Second Rule is Valid: As a bonus to amend to the above, the rule can be proven to be valid (as opposed to merely real) in additional ways. In medicine the Hygiene Hypothesis basically states that too little germ exposure makes our immune system weak, thus we should occasionally embrace low level exposure. A recent study gave weight to this at least in children, connecting common bacterial species to healthy immune response and less allergies later in life [7]. This is not to say eat off the bathroom floor, merely that occasional small doses of household germs (such as from dropped food which was recovered quickly) may actually be beneficial.

S8881963f-A7735373f	God IS real	"I agree that it's wrong to control people using religion like the Catholic Church did. But belief is a choice that everyone has to make. When a person truly is a follower of God, they WANT to obey him, not because they are scared of the consequences of not obeying. They have a deep love for him and want others to be able to experience that also. Evolution couldn""t ""just so happen"" to make anything so amazing as the human. The basis of our thoughts comes from the Lord, not from a blob of slime. And we have a soul, an eternal life! But that""s where faith comes in.

Adam and Eve disobeyed him and the world is no longer perfect, because God cannot be in the same place as sin. Heaven is perfect so He is there waiting for us, his beloved children, to run to him. Yes, we do change cells, but God created the intricate processes needed for it. We were given the choice to have children or not to have children. He even gave us the choice to believe something like evolution. He did create earthly things to last forever, but once we sinned that automatically changed. Now, humans"" earthly bodies die, but not our spiritual ones. He allows things that he made to be destroyed to show us that nothing from the earth lasts forever, so we must follow him. To answer your question, God was not created. He is outside of time. It is hard for a nonbeliever to understand. God is so amazing and awesome that we cant even begin to comprehend all of his works.

S74fdcbb5-A4262fe37	God Is Not Real	"I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. Definitions: God: the Christian interpretation of God Intelligent Design: the theory that life cannot have arisen by chance and was designed and created by some intelligent entity. Evolution: the process by which different kinds of living organisms have developed and diversified from earlier forms during the history of the earth. Larynx: the hollow muscular organ forming an air passage to the lungs and holding the vocal cords in humans and other mammals; the voice box. Aorta: the main artery of the body, supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system. God's logic is exceptionally flawed. If God ""intelligently designs"" each human, in his own image, why does he decide to make people gay? The Bible clearly condemns homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22). God crafts this unique human, decides to make them gay, and sends him or her to Earth, and when he or she dies, he sends them to Hell for being gay. The very idea of praying is pointless. God has already decided the day each person will die (Psalm 139:16). A cancer patient could pray for every second of the day, but whether they live or die depends entirely on God's plan, and praying in a situation like this would not change God's plan. God has ""intelligently designed"" everything according to the Bible (Hebrews 3:4). Design, in nature, is unintelligent. In the case of giraffes, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the muscles in the larynx, is approximately 15 ft long. The nerve comes from the brain, passes within an inch of the larynx, travels down the giraffe's neck, loops under the aorta, travels back up the giraffe's neck, and connects to the larynx. What kind of sane designer would choose this design, instead of connecting it directly to the larynx? The nerve travels this way because it is not inherently harmful to the giraffe, so it has not been removed by natural selection. ""Intelligent design"" and evolution are incompatible. If God has designed everything perfectly, why would he allow evolution to take place, seeing as it could possibly ruin his impeccable creations? Evolution is a proven theory, unlike the existence of God. There is no scientific evidence of God. God has never left any proof of his existence, nor did Jesus leave any proof of his miracles. If there was any evidence of God, we would talk about ""the science of God,"" not ""faith in God."""	PRO	441
Sc9cae544-Ac2975c65	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"I just wanna say real quick before things get heated that I've enjoyed this debate and I'd be happy to do it again in the future. We seem to be entering what has occurred to me to be the usually final stage in any debate – the ships in the night stage. As the arguments intensify, the distinctions become more nuanced and the chances of really understanding each other decrease. This is where it appears we both are at. I do not feel that you have understood my objections and you do not feel I have understood yours. But I must press on for this final argument – I'll do my best. Before I get to my arguments, let's talk about ‘external evidence'. I concur that it is strange to call for evidence in a theology debate, but this call does have a point. My argument is that you have simply invented a definition for love which happens to work very well with your theodicy. This is exactly what I was worried about with argument 1a from the very top of the debate (oh so long ago) and this is an ad hoc argument. My worries about the use of ad hoc argumentation are explained above. Now, what seems to be your response is that we are discussing Christianity and so Christianity is your evidence. My problem with this response is you have not, at any point given me anything in Christianity that explicitly says ""love is meant to be reciprocated"" where as I have explained that God is often called ‘the father' indicating a type of love very different from the one you think he possesses. 1) What kind of love does God have? You accuse me (correctly) of dropping your argument concerning the effect of unrequited love. This was not some large blunder on my part, but was instead a well-thought out decision. As I see it, if I am right in defining God's love as paternal, then this whole argument is irrelevant. If God is the father, he would do what is best for us regardless of if we liked it or not. This could include removing my freedom to ""throw my grandmother's treats into the trash"" i.e. spurn Gods love. He could just make us love him and accept him and carry about our merry way. What happens to us if we reject God's freely-given love is irrelevant until we have determined that God would even give us the opportunity to reject him. So, here's where I stand. I do not see any reason to think that God's love works the way you describe. This is where evidence is needed because when people have two different interpretations of the world, evidence and reason are the only ways to settle the dispute. Since you essentially have nothing supporting your arbitrary definition of love, I can't go with you on this point. 2) Given that you rest of your debate has been so good, your response on here is unfortunate. First, I want to take a moment to discuss my red herring. I just want to bask a little in totally refuting your claim that ""There is no causation between religion/atheism and intelligence"" with not one, but TWO independent studies that suggest something completely different…. Ahh, that feels good. Ok, now you claim that I am arguing here that more reason and logic endowed in human beings would make no one reject God and that God should have created us this way. I want to point out AGAIN, that I merely used that as an example of a way that ""freedom to reject"" could exist without actual rejection. For your convenience, here are some quotes from me, telling you that I am not arguing what you think I'm arguing: Round 2: ""Why can't God create a world in which everyone is free, yet everyone freely accepts God? … unless you can demonstrate that freedom and complete acceptance of God are, by necessity, in contradiction, the response cannot fly"" Round 3: ""I am suggesting that it is not logically contradictory that everyone could have ""freedom to reject"" but no one would choose it … Again, this argument is important because if a world where freedom to reject did not imply actual rejection could exist, then a morally perfect God would not create any other world."" Round 4: ""additionally, I wasn't even really trying to say that God could make us smarter to make us accept him more. What I am saying fundamentally is that it is not logically impossible that we could have ""freedom to reject"" and not have actual rejection. It MUST be the case that God could not create a world where we have all the advantages of unforced love without anyone going to Hell or your theodicy fails and I do not see any answer to this point coming from you."" In every single round I have stated that my argument is that the two concepts are not logically contradictory and in every single round I have stated that without logical contradiction, your theodicy fails. You have had 3 rounds since I made this claim to answer it and you have failed 3 times. I should win on this point alone and on your fundamental failure to understand my argument and then you absurd attempt to tell me what I argued. If a world can exist where everyone has freedom to accept God and everyone does it, then a morally perfect God should do exactly that. According to your own ah hoc theodicy, he has not done this. This either means that God is not morally perfect, or there is no hell. If there can be a KO punch in this debate, I think this argument and the corresponding lack of refutation is it. CONCLUSION: My opponent failed to demonstrate that God's love works the way he describes. This demonstration is necessary because we disagree fundamentally on this topic and without it, I cannot accept his love-as-reciprocation idea. Secondly, and most easily, my opponent failed to understand that I challenged him on 3 separate occasions to demonstrate that ""freedom to reject"" necessitates actual rejection and 3 times he completely failed to demonstrate this. He thus implicitly concedes this argument and I win on that alone. If he responds in this last speech it's too late. He's had his turn and squandered it. Thanks for the debate, it's been fun."

One, girl surviving a crash is unlikely but not impossible. If on average, a plane has 100 passengers, and the number of survivors is somewhere between 0 and 100, then the probability that 1 person survives a crash is 1%. (This is assuming equal probabilities, but in reality ""0"" and ""1"" are more probable than the other numbers). So on average, every 100 plane crashes will have 1 survivor. In 2012 there were 13 commercial airplane crashes, but if we include private airplains it will be in the hundreds I bet. In 5 years, that would be 65 commercial airplane crashes, and the probability of having a 1-survivor airplane crash in 5 years is 65%. The probability that this surviver is also a theist, whould be 32.5%. That is hardly a miracle at all. You give only one example of a ""miracle"" in 5 years, and you conclude that miracles happen every day. This conclusion is unfounded.

Because it reveals the holy spirit not a he as Pro claimed but as an it, something sounding like wind. What is Acts relevant? Because it reveals multiple races with different languages speaking their own native tongue to other races while the other races understand them in their own language. German speaking German to Frenchman as the Frenchmen understands every German word in French. Why is Acts relevant? Because it reveals that ""tongues"" refer to human languages. Why is Acts relevant? Because it shows humans speaking in tongues understanding each other in real languages. My use of Acts by no means proves the holy spirit is real. My use proves: 1. Pro's defense of tongues being language of angels or a way to talk to God is fiction. There is not one reference in Acts 2 where the people are speaking to angels or God or said to be speaking the language of angels; 2. Pro can't interpret her religious story correctly, is it plausible she can prove something that sounds like wind is a person in a three tier relationship? C2. ""I don't see your point for showing the Lonnie Mackley video..."" A man rambling at random. He states I'm going to ""speak in tongues"" so he's said ""I going to say something in tongues."" But he never tells us WHAT HE SAID even though he specifically told us he was going to say something in tongues. What was it? But here's the billion dollar bullsh*t that Christians don't realize kills their credibility. As I showed ""tongue"" comes from the greek word ""glossa"" which means ""language"". Christians leave plural; Lonnie thus said ""I'm going to speak in languages."" But rambled off the same similar phonetic sounds. So are their several languages that phonetically sound exactly the same? Or did he bullsh*t us with his babble? Also, speaking involves literally the vocalization of established grammatical language words. Lonnie did not speak--as in with words, he rambled off sounds. Please understand that essential fact. C3 ""I don't see your point for showing the video by ResotredCOG"" Oh. Did not a Christian pastor thoroughly debunk WITH THE BIBLE speaking in tongues does not sound like gibberish but real human language? You didn't look at the video. He methodically broke down with your Bible what tongues is and isn't. Pro feels it's okay for her to use a Christian to support a biblical topic; but it isn't okay for anyone to use a Christian to discredit a biblical topic. So a devout Christian's beliefs are only valid to support biblical malarkey but a devout Christian's beliefs are invalid if they discredit biblical malarkey. And they have the nerve to call Atheists illogical. D. ""The debate has been particularly a waste of time..."" Actually it wasn't. It showed us: -- a Christian debater blindly expected us to blindly believe the holy spirit is real simply by stating it. -- a Pro laying down a loosely thought-out resolution, believing it was ironclad with factual maxims. -- a Con revealing that if one crucial belief in the Bible is shown blemished the whole house Christianity crumbles. E. "" In conclusion I will say that the Holy Spirit hasn't been refuted and I had to spend half the time explaining and retelling my case so my argument could only go so far."" You didn't prove the holy spirit real as claimed whereas I proved it cannot be proved real when Christians are divided upon is it a he or it; does it make you ramble out indistinguishable sounds or does it make you speak decipherable human words. You spent ""half the time explaining and retelling"" your case because you presented a factless, illogical argument based on your belief that proving the holy spirit as real was easy as saying look at those people there, they're happy, they have the holy spirit, the holy spirit is real, see I proved it. I have no doubt you are a sincere believer in your bible beliefs, but advertised for a debate on one, so I just gave you want I got to offer in opposition."	CON	444

Sa2c55adb-Aa7758e74	God is not real	"""I never said science disproves God, I'm just saying it can't prove it either, just like it can't disprove the Easter bunny, flying spagetti monster, aliens like you said, or anything else supernatural."" But you can actually see people hiding the easter eggs so.......yeah. MAYBE FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTERS DO EXIST. ""You found that in the bible, and you know what's also in the bible? That the Earth is flat."" I have read the bible many times and the bible never said the earth is flat. If you are going to quote a bible then, at least say where it is. ""Also, it talks about how a tree from the center of the Earth will reach the heavens that everyone else on Earth could see it."" 1.If you are going to quote a bible then, at least say where it is. 2.It could just be figurative language The children and small unborn babies would receive eternal happiness with god in heaven. The life on earth is not really important but merely to set us up for our place in heaven. One of the most haunting questions we face concerns the problem of evil. Why is there evil in the world if there is a God? Why isn""t He doing something about it? Many assume that the existence of evil disproves the existence of God. Sometimes the problem of evil is put to the Christian in the form of a complex question, ""If God is good, then He must not be powerful enough to deal with all the evil and injustice in the world since it is still going on. If He is powerful enough to stop wrongdoing, then He Himself must be an evil God since He""s not doing anything about it even though He has the capability. So which is it? Is He a bad God or a God that""s not all powerful?"" Even the biblical writers complained about pain and evil. ""Evils have encompassed me without number"" (Psalm 40:12, RSV). ""Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?"" (Jeremiah 15:18, RSV). ""The whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now"" (Romans 8:22, RSV). Thus we readily admit that evil is a problem and we also admit that if God created the world the way it is today, He would not be a God of love, but rather an evil God. However the Scriptures make it plain that God did not create the world in the state in which it is now, but evil came as a result of the selfishness of man. The Bible says that God is a God of love and He desired to create a person and eventually a race that would love Him. But genuine love cannot exist unless freely given through free choice and will, and thus man was given the choice to accept God""s love or to reject it. This choice made the possibility of evil become very real. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they did not choose something God created, but, by. their choice, they brought evil into the world. God is neither evil nor did He create evil. Man brought evil upon himself by selfishly choosing his own way apart from God""s way. Because of the Fall, the world now is abnormal. Things are not in the state that they should be in. Man, as a result of the Fall, has been separated from God. Nature is not always kind to man and the animal world can also be his enemy. There is conflict between man and his fellowman. None of these conditions were true before the Fall. Any solution that might be given to the problems mankind faces must take into consideration that the world as it stands now is not normal. Although evil is here and it is real, it is also temporary. Evil will eventually be destroyed. This is the hope that the believer has. There is a new world coming in which there will be no more tears or pain because all things will be made new (Revelation 21:5). Paradise lost will be paradise regained. God will right every wrong and put away evil once for all, in His time. If God created all things, He must have created evil. However, evil is not a 'thing' like a rock or a puppy. Just as cold is the absence of heat, evil is merely the absence of good. Therefore, creating good was all that was necessary for its opposite to come into being. Although God's creation was good, He put in it two humans with volition, the choice to obey or rebel. Sadly, they chose the latter. Just as Lucifer rebelled against His perfect Creator in the perfect heaven, so Adam and Eve chose to rebel against Him and evil was born out of that rebellion. God did not create evil... but humans did. Christians have a justification for fighting evil, immorality and corruption. The world was not designed with evil in mind and the believer has a real basis for fighting social ills. He is not following the belief that whatever is, is right. The Christian does not condone wrongdoing by claiming it is God""s world, neither does he assume that everything that happens is agreed to by God. God does not desire evil nor does he ever condone it. He hates evil, and the Christian also is not only to despise evil, he is obligated to do something about it. Even though sin is real, it is not something that the believer accepts as the way things ought to be. By identifying with Jesus, the believer has a duty to call things wrong that are wrong and to speak out when evil is overtaking good. The Christian is not fighting against God by fighting social problems. Natural disasters, crime, and mental retardation should not be the accepted order of things, because they were never meant to be and they will not be in God""s future kingdom. However, some people are still bothered that God even allows evil in the first place. They question His wisdom in giving man a choice in the matter. Dorothy Sayers put the problem of evil in the proper perspective: ""For whatever reason God chose to make man as he is"" limited and suffering and subject to sorrows and death""He had the honesty and the courage to take His own medicine. Whatever game He is playing with His creation, He has kept His own rules and played fair. He can exact nothing from man that He has not exacted from Himself. He has Himself gone through the whole of human experience, from the trivial irritations of family life and the cramping restrictions of hard work and lack of money to the worst horrors of pain and humiliation, defeat, despair and death. When He was a man, He played the man. He was born in poverty and died in disgrace and thought it well worthwhile"" (Dorothy Sayers, Creed or Chaos? New York, Harcourt Brace, 1949, p. 4). The Bible tells us that God""s purposes are sometimes beyond our understanding. ""For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8, 9, NASB). Paul, in a similar vein, wrote to the church at Rome, ""Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How un""searchable are His judgments and un""fathomable His ways"" (Romans 11:33, NASB). Although the Bible informs us how and why evil came about, it does not tell us why God allowed it to happen. However, we do know that God is all-wise and all-knowing and that He has reasons for allowing things to happen that are beyond our comprehension This is why there is evil in the world. Why did God not simply make us so that we could not be sinful? This is the question of free will. Without free will, we would be God's puppets. We could not truly love God. Because He desired to have a real relationship with us "" one that involves choice "" He had to allow for evil to exist. We may say that God could still give us free will while at the same time preventing the consequences of evil. This becomes a question of degrees. We may want God to intervene in the case of murder or rape. But do we want God to intervene in the case of our own idolatry? Sin is not graded on a sliding scale. All sin is an offense to God, and it all separates us from Him equally. An unsaved person whose worst sin is that of gossip is just as unsaved as a nonbeliever who is a serial killer.

Sa2c4dff2-A9ad0aff0	God is not real.	My friend, did you even read my argument? I said that man created religion, not God. Where, in my post, did I say that I was a Christian? So first off, quit making assumptions about me. Did I also not say that there are many religions and philosophies of the world? You are focusing on one religion as your argument, and not religion as a whole as your argument. There are many monotheistic religions of the world who believe in God, not just Christianity. Faith is defined as - complete trust or confidence in someone or something I have faith that God exists. You have faith that God doesn't exist. The way we come to believe, or not believe in God, is through one's own perception of the universe, and creation. To say that God doesn't exist because there is no evidence for Him, is the exact same as me saying that God does exist because there is no evidence to refute Him. The argument it's self could go on forever, and no one would win. Your headline says that God is not real. This is merely a belief. Nothing more, nothing less.	CON	447
S1a699cf1-Aa82e14cb	ADHD is not real	Okay so I will go through your argument piece by piece. You say: ' It is a specific set of traits that are grouped together, it negatively affects that way that people live their day to day life' . I have already stated this pretty much, I don't understand how this suggests that it is not 'real'. For many labels for groups of traits could be devised, and these may negatively effect someone's life. It does not make them real... Also I would add that the NHS definition for ADHD, definition being the symptoms (as these are the only thing that is there), is very vague, not at all specific. 'High energy levels' 'Lack of attention' etc. These are present in all people and especially children! You say: 'Some people are unable to focus or do anything in a socially acceptable manner without medication' 'socially acceptable manner'? You mean, sit a desk and do low-grade clerical work? I'm not surprised some children find this torture, it is not natural. Not to mention all the other things in this society that influence children to be fun loving, and the stigmatization of hard work, and even the modern diet has been shown to increase all the same symptoms of ADHD. What do you say to primitive culture (or 'normal' culture as I like to call it) not having ADHD? In your view, is it a genetic mutation that is spreading quicker than thought genes could multiply? Or is it a reflection of a society not made to fit our nature? What medication would you give? http://www.youtube.com... and http://www.youtube.com... An excellent talk whereby he says that the teachers of a particular school said 'the drugs made him less attentive, less interested, less animated and more reserved, but at least he was quiet!' does that sound like a good attitude to ADHD to you? You say: 'I do not believe that drugs are the right way to solve this problem- perhaps alternative medication or natural solutions' So if drugs aren't the right way, it can only be a change in the environment and the learned cognition of the individual. Therefore it must have also of been this that caused it, surely? So if you believe this to be true we have no argument. Though you say alternative medicine or natural solutions, so I don't know if you are talking of medicine. So please answer the issues I brought up in my opening statement: Basically that it is a reflection of an unnatural life. We all live it, but I am saying ADHD is not something you are born with nor can you acquire it without relevant influence.	PRO	448

S39bab7b8-A4417d139	The following users will probably go to hell because Christian theism is true.	"I have made it my goal in this debate to demolish the intellectual and moral pretenses of the Christian religion. Of course this demolition will have to take a back seat to the resolution that awaits us. I consider Christianity to be a wicked, depraved, and intellectually bankrupt cult that consistently perpetuates blatant falsehoods and is responsible for outrageous amounts of needles suffering- even whilst it maintains an air of superciliousness. Two thousand years is far too long far any illusion to be sheltered from the light of reason. The time of its destruction is before us. My antagonist will simply be arguing in favor of the truth of Christian theism, no more and no less. ============ The condemned: ============ Everyone on this list is confirmed as being either an atheist or an agnostic. And the resolution my antagonist will try to affirm is that it's reasonable to conclude that these people will have their skeptical doubts rewarded with an eternity of suffering. (I-am-a-panda) (idontbelieveit) (SWfiend) (Ragnar_Rahl) (JBlake) (Nags) (Rezzealaux) (TheSkeptic) (atheistman) (Maikuru) (MTGandP) (comoncents) (Realist) (tmhustler) (theLwerd) (RoyLatham) and, of course, myself (Freeman) ======== Contention 1: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. ======== Whatever can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. Or as Carl Sagan famously put it ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"". Without extraordinary evidence that hell exists we can reasonably say that claiming to know that certain members of our species will go to hell is an unsupported and unsupportable claim to knowledge. ======== Contention 2: Christianities method of salvation/ damnation is unsupported by evidence. ======== Sam Harris did a good job of surmising the main thesis of Christianity's salvation scheme so allow me to paraphrase what he wrote. Jesus Christ, a carpenter by trade, was born by parthenogenesis, ritually murdered upon a cross for the collective sins of his species, and then promptly resurrected after an interval of three days. Afterwards he ascended bodily to ""heaven"" where for two millennia he has watched over the Earth in anticipation of his imminent return, at which time he will judge humanity for its skeptical doubts and grant immortality to those that had the good fortune to be convinced, upon mother's knee, that this baffling litany of miracles was the most important series of truth claims ever revealed about our cosmos. [1]-[2] Of course Jesus hasn't completely left humanity out to dry after his untimely departure from this Earth. If you manage to telepathically tell this invisible carpenter/ zombie/ deity that you will forever be his servant in loving worship then you will get bliss in the afterlife. He has also availed himself to be conveniently eaten in the form of a cracker to remind you of how unworthy and wretched you are. This would also technically constitute cannibalism if you are a believing Catholic. Is there any doubt that if only a single person were to believe this he would be considered mad? ======== Contention 3: Hearsay is insufficient evidence to validate the truth of miracles. ======== The main quandary with arguing for the truth of religion, and Christianity in particular, is that the evidence for our religious doctrines is either terrible or non-existent. Christianity is predicated upon the reliability of the miracle stories of Jesus laid out in the New Testament. This is why people believe that Jesus is the son of God, divine, etc. These textual claims are problematic for a number of reasons. As many of you are probably already aware the earliest Gospels were not written until some four decades after Jesus was supposedly crucified. [3] On top of this there are no extra biblical accounts of the miracles of Jesus. But the truth is actually quite a bit worse than that. Even if we had multiple contemporaneous eye witness accounts of the miracles of Jesus that would still not provide a sufficient basis to believe that these events actually occurred. The problem is that first hand accounts of miracles are quite common even in the 21st century. There are literally millions of educated westerners who think that their favorite guru has magic powers. The powers ascribed to these gurus are every bit as outlandish as those that were given to Jesus. Millions of people believe that Sathya sai baba, the south Indian guru, is a living god. He has been claimed, by his followers, to have raised the dead, materialize objects and he even claims to have been born of a virgin- which isn't all that unique in the history of religion or in history generally. [4] If you're curious enough you can even watch some of his miracles on youtube. Sathya sai baba's miracles probably wouldn't even impress most children that weren't otherwise indoctrinated into his tawdry cult. So why, dear Christian, don't you treat the miracle stories of Jesus with the same skepticism? ======== Contention 4: A brief history of unreason ======== Religion had the unfortunate advantage of being our first form of Philosophy. Full credit to religion for attempting this, some one had to try after all. But because it was our first it was our worst. Such is the case with virtually all other human endeavors. Ten thousand years ago we didn't know why the tides came in and out, why the sun rose, why people die, where we came from. God seemed to be a perfectly reasonable explanation for that time. We now have better explanations both for the origins of our species and for the origins of our cosmos; so much better that had they been available to us ten thousand years ago religion never would have taken root. [5]-[6] No one would now go back to a time when we had no real philosophy; when we thought that the Earth was flat and that it orbited the Sun. Religion comes to us, in other words, from the infancy of our species. It comes to us from a time when we didn't know that there were microorganisms that caused disease. Theology was the branch of ignorance that came to us from a time when all causal relationships about the world were opaque and when we didn't know a damn thing. Therefore it is not surprising that our curious and bemused ancestors would have endorsed various supernatural explanations for various natural phenomena; they didn't know any better. ======== Conclusion ======== The fact that I could write this essay and sleep peacefully at night should be a sign to you of how unfounded I think your religious certainties are. I am not convinced by any of the patently absurd miracle stories of Christianity or any of the shoddy philosophical arguments that have been used to support them, and I don't think you should be either. On the other hand I am convinced by the evidence which shows that Christians are part of a pathological subculture that has been groomed to not look critically upon its own discourse. This entire game is zero sum, dear Christian; one of us will have to concede after having admitted to intellectual and moral defeat. Best, Freeman Sources: [1] http://www.reasonproject.org...

Were the topic The Five-Second Rule is True, this would be on topic; however real is a judgment on existence rather than of quality. Imagine claiming The Bible does not exist because it contains mythology, even while pointing at very real copies of the named item. Is my coffee not real, just because it’s from a lower quality café? “…‘other people employ the rule as a polite social fiction that will allow them to still eat a lightly contaminated piece of food, despite the potential reservations of their peers.’” Near concession? Con seems to be in firm agreement with me that the rule exists, and cites a firm example of how it is used with knowledge of lesser contamination (as opposed to if con was arguing the rule calls for zero contamination). “This was an episode in mythbusters.” Ignoring the obvious problems of that not being MythBusters when represented as such… 1. At 2:07 they step on the food, no version of the Five Second Rule calls for also stepping on it. 2. At 2:20 in the video, they cough onto the food and swabs. 3. At 3:15 they contaminate the samples dropped in dirt with their mouths, which are known to be dirty. 4. At 3:40 they claim a pile of flour is the same thing as bacterium. Unless you are proposing no one eat bread, this is of no merit. 5. No stopwatch was used in the study. Scientists do not tend to rely on such variable timepieces as teenaged girls. 6. At no point are they seen to wear sterile gloves, or even wash their hands before handling the food to be studied; thus there is no way to know if the bacterial growth seen stems from the ground or their dirty hands. “‘There was no significant difference in the number of bacteria collected from 2 seconds exposure as there was from 6 seconds exposure.’” Flaws in their study have been thoroughly proven; see point 6 above for the probable cause of the no significant difference. “Sources” With the exception of the video, those were not actually connected to the argument.

Sc9cae544-A407c7274	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"If you don't mind, I'll just jump right in. 1) Ok, so the main argument from you is that ""I assert that love is meant to be reciprocated"" and I feel as if your whole argument, indeed your whole theodicy hinges on this single claim. I challenge this claim by mentioning that love without expectations seems purer than love that expects something in return. A famous bible verse echoes this idea that love has no expectations: ""Love is patient; love is kind and envies no one. Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude; never selfish, not quick to take offense. There is nothing love cannot face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, and endurance. In a word, there are three things that last forever: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of them all is love. (1 Corinthians 13:4)"" What I see as responses to this challenge from you are a few quotes: ""love is by design, by the Designer, intended to be reciprocated."" And: ""Love is…done because one is moved by the other person's inherent truth and goodness and beauty, but the exposing of oneself sequentially creates the Hope of being loved in return."" In both cases, I see very little in the way of external evidence supporting the claim that love is meant to be reciprocated. You have merely fiated that God intends love to be reciprocated and then described a vision of love that is consistent with you love-as-reciprocation view. So as I see it, your argument boils down to love is meant to be reciprocated because God created it that way. Now, we clearly have no way to know how God intended love to work unless he tells us (he is noticeably silent on many issues), but we can look at the evidence and see that many terrific forms of love are often not reciprocated or are imperfectly reciprocated (such as the plethora of forms I mention) and conclude that maybe God did not create love to be reciprocated. So, without adequate support for your love-as-reciprocation view, I do not see any reason to agree with it. 2) You claim: ""There is no causation between religion/atheism and intelligence."" Now, it is of course, technically true that we do not have data suggesting causation between these variables (because we can't manipulate intelligence) but we have some correlation data suggesting a connection: ""In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs, and compared their personality characteristics. He found that ""Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics."" He used SAT's as a measure of intelligence for this study."" (http://en.wikipedia.org...) ""Sociologist Zena Blau of the University of Houston recently conducted a study of more than a thousand children in Chicago. [...] In 1981 Blau reported that IQs were lowest among children whose mothers have overly strict religious beliefs. Children whose mothers were from a non-denominational or non-religious background had the highest average IQs - 110 for whites, 109 for blacks. Children whose mothers belonged to ""fundamentalist"" religious groups tended to have IQs that were 7 to 10 points lower. According to Blau, these religion-IQ differences hold even when you take into account the mother's social class, current occupational status, and education."" (Understanding Human Behavior"" by James V. McConnel, p555-6) So, there is an inverse connection between religious belief and intelligence and it does not seem to me to be caused by entertainment. To my mind, we as a society are becoming smarter and thus less religious. But there's no way to know for sure. This seems to refute the whole point of your response on this point. Additionally, I wasn't even really trying to say that God could make us smarter to make us accept him more. What I am saying fundamentally is that it is not logically impossible that we could have ""freedom to reject"" and not have actual rejection. It MUST be the case that God could not create a world where we have all the advantages of unforced love without anyone going to Hell or your theodicy fails and I do not see any answer to this point coming from you. CONCLUSION: I do not have any external evidence validating my opponents claim on point 1 that ""love is meant to be reciprocated"" despite the fact that I repeatedly provide examples of love that does not necessarily involve reciprocation. On point 2 I assert that my opponent's theodicy and no one going to Hell are not logically contradictory so an all-powerful, morally perfect deity should create such a world. I do not see any reason to doubt this claim coming from my opponent."	PRO	456
Sc9cae544-A9e5c318a	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (redo)	"I have enjoyed this debate quite a bit as well. But we're down to the final round. I've presented my position in full in round 4, for readers who are interested in cutting to the chase, and I will simply take these closing remarks to address Kvaughan's last points. He begins by returning to an original argument from Round 2. >""My argument is that you have simply invented a definition for love which happens to work very well with your theodicy. >""Now, what seems to be your response is that we are discussing Christianity and so Christianity is your evidence. My problem with this response is you have not, at any point given me anything in Christianity that explicitly says ""love is meant to be reciprocated"" where as I have explained that God is often called ‘the father' indicating a type of love very different from the one you think he possesses."" But I have, you simply haven't interacted with them. I argued, Intended Reciprocity: ""We know this from the massive disparity in the consequences of love which is returned and love which is not."" Romantic Love: ""While I don't think the Bible mentions ""grandmotherly"" love, all of these are applicable to God, run parallel with each other, and are given to us as a 'type' to understand how we are to experience God."" As for Christian evidence, in the very first round, I prevented an extended quote from Hoseah in the form of wedding vows. The rest of Hoseah, incidentally, is a tirade of God against Israel for being an unfaithful lover. And yet, you ignore this in favor of a ""Fatherly Love"" position. But assuming that Fatherly Love is as distinct from Spousal love as you imply, yours is the ad hoc position, not mine. You are trying to argue, without evidence, that this is the single type of love out of many which Christianity relates to Omnibenevolence and to Eternal Life. But I have presented evidence in the very first Round that Omnibenevolence, Eternal Life and Hell are defined not by the Fatherly love, but by an intimate love. I demonstrated, ""This is eternal life, that THEY MAY KNOW YOU, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."" (John 17:3) And the word ""know"" here is a double entendre, often used to express sex. Consequently, the Fatherly love of God is not relevant to the discussion of Hell, as the love in question is an intimate love meant to be reciprocated. It therefore means that God would not force Himself onto the other person. As for your evidence, >""First, I want to take a moment to discuss my red herring. I just want to bask a little in totally refuting your claim that ""There is no causation between religion/atheism and intelligence"" with not one, but TWO independent studies that suggest something completely different…."" Total Fallacy: I admitted a correlation, you didn't come close to proving causation. If you really wanted a proof of where intelligence leads, find a study which compares the IQs of people converting to Catholicism from Atheism, and from Atheism to Catholicism. As someone who is and knows many converts, the contrast is quite striking. And anyways, Church attendance now is about the same as it was in the Middle Ages. With only 12 percent of the world claiming to be atheist, I'm not sure that's any higher than anywhere else in time. Finally, you pull four supposed arguments from each sequential round to supposedly show how God could create a world where people could have freedom to reject, without actually rejecting. But all of your quotes essentially say the same thing, and don't actually make an argument, let alone interacts with the reasoning I've already provided. In your own summary: >""In every single round I have stated that my argument is that the two concepts are not logically contradictory and in every single round I have stated that without logical contradiction, your theodicy fails."" Yes, you have so stated. Four times no less. But all of the human faculties are created by God, and if there is any such faculty which motivates our choice irrefutably, then God has made our choice for us. I made this clear in Round 2: ""Otherwise it would mean you were programmed to accept."" Only one's personal choice is relevant. If for any reason every person would not reject God, then there is no free will. Freedom to Accept must come with Freedom to Reject, and it is not freedom but slavery or coercion if God is forcibly motivating that choice for you. Moreover, in Round 3, I also went back to the definition of love and the need for Love to be done without expectation, saying that: ""Doing so would create the expectation that everything which exists will love you in return, so that love would become obligation and not love."" And you seem to concur, saying in Round 4: >""I challenge this claim by mentioning that love without expectations seems purer than love that expects something in return."" CONCLUSION: I have consistently, sufficiently, addressed Kvaughan's arguments. God vowed Himself to Omnibenevolence, meaning that through self-sacrifice, He revealed Himself to us, creating the Hope of a Loving Intimacy meant to be returned."	CON	457

Sa2c55b38-A4f39b158	God is not real	"Well my opponent essentially conceded the debate. However, I'll just keep the discussion going, because why not? 1) Responding to the claim that God doesn't have any supporting evidence. Most of the evidence for God is philosophical or based on mathematical conjecture (argument from complexity). However, the arguments in themselves are fairly convincing. Plus, the documentation in the Bible is some of the most historically accurate information about ancient times. The only parts that aren't agreed upon are the parts that mention God's intervention. According to the Smithsonian Institution, ""Much of the Bible, in particular the historical books of the old testament, are as accurate historical documents as any that we have from antiquity and are in fact more accurate than many of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Greek histories. ""These Biblical records can be and are used as are other ancient documents in archaeological work. For the most part, historical events described took place and the peoples cited really existed. This is not to say that every event as reported in the historical books happened exactly as stated."" So whether you believe in God or not, a lot of the Bible is fairly accurate. You can tell authors paid attention to detail when they started out certain verses. For example, Nehemiah 1:1 says, ""The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twelfth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa."" So it's a documentation of when this verse was written. The Bible also references other historical sources to compare it too in several verses (very heavily used in 2 Kings). My point here is that because the Bible is taken seriously as a historical document, it puts a lot more weight on the fact that The Bible isn't just a book full of magic and religious ramblings about God. The people who wrote the Bible were fairly accurate, and most of them were historians to some degree. 2) This is actually my opponent's first numbered point. The Hebrew Bible was written before the Greeks wrote their Bible, and it wasn't to explain natural phenomena. The Bible was written for several reasons. It was written as a historical document (as mentioned above), it contained books of laws (parts of Exodus and Numbers plus all of Leviticus), and it even included ancient versions of accounting balance sheets (the first part of Numbers). The Greeks did use mythology to explain natural phenomena, but the only example of that in the Bible is the creation of the world. 3) The devil is actually a fallen angel who has not made it to Hell yet. However, I understand the common misconception. The idea of Satan has been misconstrued to a great degree. Satan's purpose is to provide the possibility of free will to humans. Humans would not have free will without him, because we would only know God. Because God is a God of love, he needs free will to exist in order for his creation to reciprocate love by choosing him over the opposite option. I hope I cleared some issues up."	CON	460

I am extremely angry (ok fine, I'm not angry, I'm rlly just fking amused) at my Religion being ridiculed. -.- I don't know whether to laugh or cry, but... Exhibit C, I have to admit, was totally bullsh1t. It was so fake, and the beard was probably fake too. I'm pretty sure Santa came through the front door instead of coming down the chimney too. Exhibit A is total bullsh1t too. Send a message to Santa is entire horsesh1t. Probably a scam, you should know better. As for the books, I haven't read them, so I can't exactly rebut it yet. Tracking is also a scam. You look, you see, it's totally common sense that that was an obvious fake. As for Step 5 & 6...Haha. It was so funny, I forgot to laugh. I'd like to see you get a legit picture of Santa, you can try the steps yourself. And I want a legit one, not your Dad having pillows stuffed inside his jacket and with a fake beard. Exhibit C was at least decent. It explained Santa's existence with Science. But, nah. ""OK, so neither of these places gets as chilly as absolute zero, but it must count for something that no deserving child would address their wish list to hot places such as, say, Borneo or Brazil. The very idea is quite ridiculous. QED (which stands for Quantum Electrodynamics, as any fule kno.)"" Nope. This theory is unfalsifiable. But I liked the theory of Santa Claus being in every place, simultaneously, everywhere, but wavefunction collapsing if discovered. Rebuttal Type 1: ""As you can see my evidence is far more persuasive because it supports the existence of Santa Claus. Now, I am 100% certain of the existence of Santa and I will prove his existence to you."" Nope. My argument, will always, always be far more persuasive. Particularly because it is widely known that Santa is a lie. ""Clearly the presents had to be created from somewhere. The presents can't just spring into existence from nothing."" The ""intelligent design"" is ""coincidentally"" the same as human design. For some reason, the Elves have the same technology as humans. Same old plastic, same old factory. The presents had a creator, that is, the toy industries or factories. My friend caught his Dad sneaking down to put down some presents at the last minute while attempting to catch a glimpse of Santa. Parents have admitted to sneaking down and putting Christmas Presents at Midnight. It was a traumatising experience for him. As for me, my parents go to a toy shop. They ask me ""What do you want for Christmas?"" ...Sad life, I know ^ Hmm. Rebuttal Type 2. Miracles. Please define the word Miracles. Santa answers their wishes? Don't make me laugh. He answers ""at least 90% of the time"". You have stated that Santa is omniscient & omnipotent. Santa could easily grant all the Children's Wishes - 100% - if he was indeed omniscient and omnipotent. This is *NOT* logical. If Santa was indeed omniscient and omnipotent, he would not need anybody to catch him on a mere technological device (that is, a camera). Neither will he need a child to catch him putting presents below the Christmas Tree. It is hardly evidence and illogical. Santa would wanting to be on tape is pure crap. Rebuttal Type 3. ""Without Santa there is no morality! Where do you get your morals?!... Etc. Etc."" Now, my lass. You seem to have terribly mistaken Santa for God. Either this is one big troll, or I'm hallucinating. I honestly hope it's the latter. You get your morals from Religion. Christianity, Jewish, Catholic, Islam, and others. They give you a reason for life, and morals. In our Religion (yours is basically a deluded version of our Religion) God is watching us every second. He knows what we're thinking, how we're feeling. He is omniscient. He knows everything about us. God judges us for Good or Bad. You act like an angel and you help people out. Because you know Santa will reward you. This is truly undeserving, as you *act like an angel and you help people out only for the reason that Santa will reward you*. Purely helping people out (and actually, you're just acting) for the sake of presents aren't very good. You help people, and your morals are purely based on the fact and belief that Santa will give you presents if he judges you good. This shows that your ulterior motive is to *GET PRESENTS*. However, we Christians do not act. We legitly help others. We act like angels, because we know God does not judge us on our actions alone, he looks at our hearts. He knows our true motive, and he judges us based on that. Your definition of ""good"" in this context is almost purely subjective: Good = Help your mom carry groceries Bad = Not obeying your mom's orders I think those definitions are good enough. Note that you can't retract your statements. Our definition: Good = Be a ""role model"" for the none believers of Christ, be a believer, do not sin, etc. etc. Bad =...self explanatory. As you can see the difference ^ The 10 commandments are totally screwed up. I commend you on your creativity though. Santa rewards you with materialistic gifts that you crave and silently lust for, God rewards you peace of mind, happiness, joy, immortality, and many others. If you are talking about God having a mass murder on a global level of genocide, then I warn you, you will lose that one. Rebuttal Type 4. I find it strange that most of your arguments are based on the premise that Santa is real. Whatever, I'll rebut them in the context that Santa is real too then. ""I find it strange that with this power he doesn't just feed every starving person in the world but whatever."" You yourself admit that Santa's thinking is flawed. Isn't this strange? Starvation. Hunger. Tragedy. Overpopulation. ""Santa is helpful to everyone and uses his immense power very wisely."" You usually say a sentence like this when you have a limited/finite amount of power. But remember, Santa is ""omnipotent"". So he does not have to use his immense power very wisely. Santa does not have a great plan. The more I read, the more you blasphemy. I am almost extremely certain that you are trolling. Rebuttal Type 5. Purely stupid. Readers, the sh1t is real. Deez nuts. Rebuttal Type 6. Erm, it's Bible. There is no such ""babble"". There is no existence of that book. Only the existence of the Bible. Babble definition: talk rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way. Rebuttal Type 7. You are wrong indeed, in your flawed belief of Santa. You did not live a life of morals, you blasphemed. Firstly, we are correct. You are wrong. Nobody wants toys. We don't get coal either. If you honestly believe that all non-believers of Santa get coal, then slap yourself. Nobody wants toys. We want real gifts, gifts that only our omnipotent, omniscient, eternal, and transcendent of time God can give us. He offers us everything. Everything we want. Not mere toys. Rebuttal Type 8. It is a widely held, universally known fact that Santa does not exist. This is a *FACT*. Rebuttal Type 9. Wait. I just read this. You wot m8? The outcome of this Debate is concluded. Dude, trust me, taking drugs/weed is not cool. Destroys your body, and makes you *hallucinate*. If you are talking legitly, then that is the Satan, corrupting you, which partially explains why you are like that. He has not done any miracles. Jesus is the true saviour. He is a LIE. I never said that a widely held belief makes something true. God is scientifically and...............proven. If every single person believed in Santa, then even I, admit that I will believe in Santa. He will be real to me, but he will not be real in reality, nor before God. Note that you have not posted any rebuttals for some of my statements or rebuttals. This means that you AGREE with me.

Pro's states there isn't any proof heaven is real outside the bible, he has yet to demonstrate the bible is true, so he it cannot be said that he has fulfilled his burden of proof. He states there isn't any proof God isn't real, however since Pro is making the claim the burden of proof is on him. Con need only Nonetheless, I will present an argument attacking the concept that there is a heaven. I will attempt to demonstrate that once we are dead, we are dead. There is no other place anyone's minds or souls will go to. If this is true, then there is no heaven, as heaven is defined as a place where people's identities go after death. I will be extrapolating the argument from a previous debate of mine [http://www.debate.org...] Why Heaven doesn't Exist. When thinking about the requirements for a theory of personal identity which is compatible with an afterlife we come to two possible explanations. We either have something in common with the spiritual or something which can be recreated in the spiritual. The first idea is that the content of our consciousness (memories, ect) is what makes us the same person over time and is reconstructed in heavenly material. This allows for physicalist ontologies of the mind (the view that the mind is physical) because the material of a person is irrelevant, only the content. The other is a dualist view, that we have something already in common with the spiritual because we posses a soul. The soul is what makes us ""us"" overtime and is simply transferred into heaven when we die. Both of these are problematic. Problems with Reconstructionism Two people can have the same psychology. If for some reason the commander of the afterlife, like God messed up and created you now, it clearly wouldn’t be you. After all, two people cannot be identical to the same person. Let’s say, I die and my psychology is reconstructed in the afterlife. But, at the same time my psychology is also reconstructed on a computer, what would’ve happened to me? Psychology doesn’t need to be unique to individuals and therefore, a psychological constructionist view of the afterlife is false. Problems with Dualism Another view is dualism. When you go to the afterlife, your nonphysical identity goes to a nonphysical place. This is the conception that your soul “floats up” to the afterlife. Since I’ve demonstrated identity doesn’t lay in facts about psychology, the question comes up how exactly does the soul preserve identity? What makes my soul and your soul different? It cannot be facts about psychology or facts about the physical. It asserts it preserves identity without explaining how. What would happen if our souls switched? Nothing about our consciousness or bodies would change, but we would be different people. There doesn’t seem there would be any difference whatsoever. There could be constant soul switchings and we’d never know. As William James said “A difference which makes no difference is no difference at all.” [http://www.quoteyard.com...] A dualist theory of identity cannot explain identity in the first place. We cannot get to the afterlife by being reconstructed or by being “carried up”, but since an afterlife is a realm where individual's identity goes, then there cannot be an afterlife. As an individual's identity cannot go to any other realm. Now to Pro."	CON	463
Sf48c7376-A7f4e2573	Global warming is real	"Research has led to an overwhelming consensus among climate scientists that climate change, a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations, is a real, anthropogenic phenomenon being driven by fossil fuel emissions. Data from multiple sources seem to point to the same conclusion. Average temperature indicators since the Industrial Revolution as well as increasing intensity of weather patterns in recent years, and historical trends in levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have convinced well over 90% of the scientific community that global warming is happening now and, if left unchecked, could be catastrophic for the biosphere. The main objections to this theory have been made by skeptics who tend to be unqualified or biased; most of these ""scientists"" have financial interests in the oil industry or their research was funded by oil executives such as the Koch brothers. In fact, even some of this oil-subsidized research has concluded that, in fact, this is a real issue.

Sd3b36db4-A7f20e010	Homosexuality is a sin and if one continues in the sin, then it will sadly lead that person to hell.	"I am glad to see Telanian have this discussion with me. I trust that we all will seek to come to know the truth. Obviously, Telanian is an atheist. If I were to put my argument in a form, then it would go something like this: If God exists, and the Bible is God's word, and the Bible teaches X, then X is true. X would stand for homosexuality is a sin. I know that for my argument to stand, then I must prove God exists and the Bible is God's Word, and we can debate on those two subjects in the near future. I am going to go ahead and do so since I must prove my proposition. Obviously, my opponent realizes that the Bible does clearly teach that it is a sin and if it not repented of, but rather continued in, then it will tragically lead that person to hell. My proposition stands true if I can prove the first two things. The cosmological argument states: ""If there ever had been a time when nothing existed, then there would be nothing now. It is a self-evident truth that nothing produces nothing. In view of this, since something exists now, it must follow logically that something has existed forever. As Sproul has remarked: Indeed, reason demands that if something exists, either the world or God (or anything else), then something must be self-existent.... There must be a self-existent being of some sort somewhere, or nothing would or could exist (1994, pp. 179,185 emp. in orig.). Everything that exists can be classified as either matter (which includes energy), or mind. There is no third alternative. The theist's argument, then, is this: Everything that exists is either matter or mind. Something exists now, so something eternal must exist. Therefore, either matter or mind is eternal. Either matter or mind is eternal. Matter is not eternal, per the evidence cited above. Thus, it is mind that is eternal. That eternal mind is God. (http://www.apologeticspress.org... The teleological argument states: 1. If the Universe shows evidence of design,it must have had a designer. 2. The Universe does show evidence of design. 3. Thus, the Universe must have had a designer. (http://apologeticspress.org...) The universe, animals, human beings, etc. all show design, therefore pointing to a Designer - God. The moral argument states: ""Premise 1: If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist. Premise 2: Objective moral values exist. Conclusion: God exists. Thomas B. Warren worded the argument in a positive, more detailed manner in his debates with atheist Antony Flew (p. 173) and Wallace Matson (p. 285). If the moral code and/or actions of any individual or society can properly be subjects of criticism (as to real moral wrong), then there must be some objective standard (some ""higher law which transcends the provincial and transient"") which is other than the particular moral code and which has an obligatory character which can be recognized. The moral code and/or actions of any individual or society can properly be subjects of criticism (as to real moral wrong). Therefore, there must be some objective standard (some ""higher law which transcends the provincial and transient"") which is other than the particular moral code and which has an obligatory character which can be recognized. Why do most rational people believe in objective morality? That is, why do people generally think that some actions are ""right"" and some actions are ""wrong,"" regardless of people's subjective opinions? Why do most people believe that it is ""evil"" or ""wicked"" (1) for someone to walk into a random house, shoot everyone in it, and steal everything in sight? (2) for a man to beat and rape a kind, innocent woman? (3) for an adult to torture an innocent child simply for the fun of it? or (4) for parents to have children for the sole purpose of abusing them sexually every day of their lives? Because, as evolutionist Edward Slingerland noted, humans have metaphysical rights—rights that are ""a reality beyond what is perceptible to the senses"" (""Metaphysical,"" 2011)—and ""rely on moral values."" The fact is, most people, even many atheists, have admitted that real, objective good and evil exist."" (http://www.apologeticspress.org...) I can guarantee you that my opponent believes that some activities are intrinsically and objectively moral or immoral, good or evil. If this does prove the case, then my opponent will be surrendering and testifying indirectly that the moral argument is stronger and is coherent and correspondent with Ultimate Reality - God. He states about the Bible: "" an ancient collection of confused and contradictory writings by scientifically illiterate men, which cannot be taken seriously as a truthful message by anyone today."" (1) My opponent has the burden of proof placed on him to show where the Bible contradicts itself and is not compatible with science. (2) He states that the Bible cannot be taken as a ""truthful message"". Implicitly, my opponent believes then that there is such a concept as a lie. He must believe that lying is immoral. Else why would he debate me on this proposition unless he believed that he was doing the moral (right) thing - tell the truth. Obviously, he believes that I am teaching a false proposition - a lie. He has further given stronger allegiance to the moral argument that God exists. ""Here is a strong argument for the Bible being the word of God: ""If it is the case that the Bible possesses property A, property B, property C . . . property Z (where the total situation involved in having such properties makes it clear that the Bible is beyond mere human production), then the Bible is the word of God. It is the case that the Bible possesses property A, property B, property C . . . property Z. Conclusion: Therefore, the Bible is the word of God. By ""property A, property B,...,"" etc., Warren meant ""affirmative propositions regarding some fact regarding the Bible"" (""God's Word"" 18). It is clear that the argument is valid in form. It is a hypothetical syllogism in which the antecedent of the major premise (1) is affirmed. The only way the argument could be shown to be unsound (i.e. the truth of the conclusion does not follow from the premises) would be to show at least one of the premises is false."" (http://warrenapologeticscenter.org...) You could put in the Property A = the fulfillment of hundreds of OT prophecies, Property B = eyewitnesses of the resurrection of Christ, Property C = Eyewitnesses of the miracles of Jesus, Property D = scientific foreknowledge, etc. I would be glad to go into this a little deeper in the next round. My opponent states: ""they can't even come up with a rational explanation as to why that god would outlaw homosexuality. The simple fact is that if god exists, if he is good and if he says that homosexuality is a sin - all things claimed by my opponent in his first statement - then there will be a good, rational reason as to why he would do so. So I ask my opponent: what is that reason?"" It is obvious that my opponent believes in logic and reasoning. Where does logic and reasoning derive from? The naturalistic worldview cannot account for logic and reasoning because how could the blind, random chance forces of matter (which somehow created itself - ""it takes more faith to be an atheist than a theist"") change or convert over into mind?"" It can't! Only the Christian worldview can account for logic and reasoning in that it derives from an Ultimate Mind - God. My opponent asked me about, ""continuing in sin""? I summarize by stating that there are former homosexuals who have given up their sin by changing their lives to God in living a righteous life. They are still tempted though and have strong tendencies or desires to commit the sin, yet overcome those temptations through submission to God who are striving to walk in the light, thus have the promise of eternal life."

S7908009f-A17bdf06d	God is Real, Evolution isn't	"I am saying that, once we die, we will discover whether atheism or Christianity is correct, so worrying about it before we find out is completely pointless. 100 years really isn't that long to wait, in the cosmic scheme of things. Perhaps all religions are true. Perhaps none are. People should be able to go wherever they want when they die. Hindu people won't go to Christian Heaven. That wouldn't make any sense. People can believe whatever they want and non tolerance of other religions is the ultimate sin that mankind can commit. Again, this doesn't have anything to do with the argument, I just thought I'd clear it up. If God kills people for not believing in him, then he's the evil one. It's evil to kill people based on their religion. Religion should not define a person. They should have a personality besides their faith. You claim that there's no evidence for evolution. Why do you say this? There's evidence all over. Go to your local natural science museum. Your mind will be blown. There are displays of mollusks at different stages of evolution, mammoth teeth, anything you can think of. Denial of this evidence is futile. It exists. We have uncovered archaeological proof of evolution. You claim that evolution should still be occurring. It is still occurring. what we see are, indeed, ""transitional"" forms. Saying that evolution has ended does not make it end. Denying the existence of evolution is like denying the existence of DNA. We know DNA exists, and if the DNA is jumbled enough, then a new life form emerges. Before attempting to disprove evolution, you should at least know how it operates. You wrongly claim that the animals as we know them now have always been the same. That's absurd. Our planet's ecosystem is constantly changing. We've driven many animals to extinction. The dodo bird, the mammoth. The list goes on and on. I'm not trying to be an environmental nut, but saying that the types of animals on the Earth never change is the same as denying the existence of woolly mammoths. We know they exist, we've found their carcasses. They are not here today. We have changed the amount of animals on Earth quite a bit. Even your ""flawless"" bible acknowledges, to some degree, the existence of change among animals: In the Adam and Eve story, snakes have legs, then God takes away their legs. Cats and dogs are incapable of breeding a hybrid because their genetic material is too different. Not just anything can breed. That's like saying a ladybug can breed with a giraffe. Both dogs and cats have evolved separately. They might have a common ancestor somewhere, but you cannot deny that dogs began as savage Arctic wolves, and cavemen started domesticating them. Soon, from the different, slight variants of wolves, there emerged huskies, and then Labradors, and dalmatians, and all the others. Dogs have evolved quite a bit, but only within their own species. Same for cats. This is a good example of solid evolution. The slow, gradual mutation of a species until it becomes a slightly different species. Man can't cause something to evolve without highly advanced technology, and the biological material of fruit flies is far different than that of a human, so the results would probably come out different. However, we do know about giant dragonflies from the prehistoric age, so insects aren't immune to evolution either. https://en.wikipedia.org... Evolution does go on much too slow for the naked eye to observe. You can't assume something will go fast. Evolution is a process which requires hundreds of thousands of generations to produce even somewhat of a change. However, due to the longevity of fossils, we are able to notice many anatomical changes in the structure of a certain species. Mollusks grew bigger over time, as did dinosaurs, and eventually, us. These fossils, of course, don't contain DNA. If they did, we would be able to construct a real life Jurassic Park. They are simply unavoidable proof of skeletons which don't apply to any currently living creature. There are no longer any dinosaurs, but we have an ample amount of their skeletons, thus, they must have existed. And, yes, many of these skeletons do show clear transitions. Of course, if somebody finds two skeletons in the same spot, chances are that they won't be too different, but we can see that the Earth's crust is broken into several layers, and as we get deeper, the things get older, and the higher we dig, the newer the things are. A denial of evolution implies that men have existed forever. We haven't. This view has been developed from hundreds of years of man feeling a sense of superiority. We are animals. We can't deny this, we're only sacks of blood and mucus, and there is something much bigger than us, but it might not be God. It might be millions of years in which we did not exist. It's hard to accept, but we must accept it. Religion was invented in a time when man had no science, and felt compelled to provide reasons for his own existence before he was prepared to. Simply the existence of more than one religion seems to prove that religion is false. If it was true, it would be a solid universal belief. Evolution is not a religion. It does not have a holy book, it does not have a messiah, it does not contain the concept of an overpowering deity. No matter how much we try to connect science and religion in our minds, it simply cannot be done. The two subjects are so contradictory that they will never agree. What I suggest is that religion is not accepted as an absolute truth, but rather, something to believe in and worship. Science, then, should be accepted as a rational system that governs our lives. Science does not have to replace religion. Contradictory systems can often work in harmony if kept separate. In Ancient China, Confucianism was accepted as the basis for society, while Taoism was accepted as a way to relax. People often practiced both, but did not consider the two to be in conflict with each other. Evolution does not try to destroy God, it provides an alternative answer, one which makes much more sense and has much more going for it. Do we really need a God? Do we need a giant man in the sky? Can't somebody believe in anything they want to? Religion is such a controversial topic that perhaps it should be abolished. No, it shouldn't, it provides comfort to the human race, and provides the possibility of life after death, but I think some people refuse to accept religion simply because of how forceful it is. People should be able to build their own religions, and religion should not require conversion. If it was true, it would not require conversion. Religion is very corrupt. For years in Medieval Europe, the pope sold indulgences. The basis of religion, like all things, is money. I should be able to believe in a giant galactic bunny named GROX 464 who lives in a pillow if I want to. I should not have to believe what other people believe. The corruption and ignorance of many religions makes people reluctant to join. You have created atheism from your refusal to accept atheism even a tiny bit. Atheism is a religion. So is Christianity. So is Zoroastrianism. Our definition of ""religion"" has been warped over the years. It's not true, it's just something you believe in, something that helps you feel better. If atheists want to deny the existence of God, they should be able to, because they are more accustomed to reality. And, if God sends them to Hell forever, just because of a lack of faith, then God is evil. I don't care if they believe or not, they're people. Atheists don't worship the devil. If they don't murder anyone, or rape anyone, they don't deserve Hell. If someone is forced to worship or burn up, of course they'll be reluctant. Of course we can't prove that there isn't a God. We can't prove there is one. There's lots of proof of science, and none of religion, besides a book. I think that says it all."	CON	466

Sae460e9d-A4d98ae47	God is real	"My first argument is in in the very roots of how the universe began. According to you god is just an illusion if I stand to be corrected. If you do not believe in divine creation you probably believe in the spontaneous big bang. I believe this because like most people you need an answer to how the universe started and since god doesn't cut it you believe in the scientific view that the big bang started spontaneously with no reason. Like most theories this one has a major flaw. Scientist have taught us all our life that all everything has a reason. the only problem is that according to the big bang theory is one day the event just happened with no reason at all. Does it truly make sense that the big bang started out of nothing. If you can explain to me how ""nothing"" can become ""something"" you have my vote. The whole theory goes against all of science but scientist turn a blind eye and proclaim ""that is what really happened"".David C Pack stated""the probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a printing shop."" (Origins?)"" . The best think about this is that If we were to put god in the picture we could say that the big bang was real and was created by divine intervention. I believe this because god spoke tho world into existence in a flash. ""The verse states In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"".Somewhat the big bang. Enough about the big bang and lets move on to the next biggest thing... Evolution. Lets not get confused evolution may explain adaptation but not in the case of origin and humans.The sad part is that people often confuse evolution for adaptation. Evolution is based entirely on faith because no facts or proof have ever been found to support much of it! Many researchers have proved that we did not ""evolve"" from monkeys. If you do not believe me you should read the article http://scienceline.ucsb.edu.... You will probably try the argument that more people believe that we evolved from apes and scientist say so so its true. The past has often showed us that just because a vast amount of people believe something doesn't mean its right. David c park sates the problem about the scientific world. Hasty Generalization: A small sample is used to reach a broad conclusion. Suppose your local car dealership only sells American cars; a hasty generalization would be to conclude that all dealerships in your state or your country only sell American cars. Begging the Question: Often referred to as circular reasoning or circular logic. An assumption is used to prove a conclusion; in turn, that conclusion is used to prove the original assumption. Misuse of Authority: Pointing to a group of experts to validate a conclusion, even if those experts disagree with each other or with the conclusion. An example would be stating that dentists prefer a certain brand of toothpaste without actually polling them on their preferences. Appeal to the People: Using the general public as a basis for proving a hypothesis instead of relying on relevant evidence. Stating, ""of course, everyone accepts that as fact,of"" is one example. Argument to Future: Stating that while a theory is not yet proven, it will be with further study and investigation. Hypothesis Contrary to Fact: Repeating as new, a theory or hypothesis already disproved. This is a kin to asserting that the Earth might be flat when evidence demonstrates otherwise. Chronological Snobbery: Refuting or proving a theory by dating evidence that is extremely old, making it either no longer available or impossible to verify. Another fact is dna. DNA in our cells is very similar to an intricate computer program. In the photo on the left, you see that a computer program is made up of a series of ones and zeros (called binary code). The sequencing and ordering of these ones and zeros is what makes the computer program work properly. In the same way, DNA is made up of four chemicals, abbreviated as letters A, T, G, and C. Much like the ones and zeros, these letters are arranged in the human cell like this: CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on. The order in which they are arranged instructs the cell's actions.What is amazing is that within the tiny space in every cell in your body, this code is three billion letters long!!To grasp the amount of DNA information in one cell, ""a live reading of that code at a rate of three letters per second would take thirty-one years, even if reading continued day and night."" Wait, there's more.It has been determined that 99.9% of your DNA is similar to everyone's genetic makeup. What is uniquely you comes in the fractional difference in how those three billion letters are sequenced in your cells.The U.S. government is able to identify everyone in our country by the arrangement of a nine-digit social security number. Yet, inside every cell in you is a three-billion-lettered DNA structure that belongs only to you. This code identifies you and continually instructs your cells' behavior. Serry Marshall, an information specialist, comments on the implications of this. ""There has never existed a computer program that wasn't designed...[whether it is] a code, or a program, or a message given through a language, there is always an intelligent mind behind it."" My last point is a rather basic point. Lets pretend there is no god and after we die we disappear forever. In that case believe in god would have no cost for me and we all meet the same fate. Now lets say that there is a god and I believe in him. I go to heaven and much of the world will suffer a horrible fate hell. I like to believe that I have a 50 percent chance that I will go to heaven because I believe in god. But you my friend will have a 0 percent chance because you do not believe. Do the math and you will see that my point makes sense. Unlike you Imperiah I like living life knowing how the world really started with a way that makes sense (the existence of god) than a hypothetical process with flaws the so big it takes ignorance to believe in it (the universe without the existence of god)"	PRO	468
Sa2c55eda-Adb587d8d	God is not real	Ofcourse there is a possibility we are wrong, but that's true for a lot of things. So much science is theories and assumptions. The possibility of being wrong is not a proof of being wrong. Universe is everything we have discovered or imagined so far. There are multiverse theories stating that there are parallel universes. You are saying the universe was here all along, but people try to extrapolate time to before the universe. They try to imagine and contemplate. Very few believe in the idea of universe existing from infinite years ago. To answer to your what ifs, we don't know, but that doesn't mean you are any more right than I. It's possible there's evidence out there of planets being created by some process, but then again, people ask- who initiated that process? Again the view of God as someone who created humans is arguable. Many theists believe in evolution. I agree the world has been around for 1000's of years, but what made it exist? Bible isn't an argument I have used or will use at any point. If you're not saying that you know there is no God, you are agnostic and not atheist so please get your definitions clear. Again ideas of pleasing God and karma and even heavens may not be true, but the idea of a creator may. No one says God controls death and birth. No one says God approves slavery, opposes women or kills people naturally attracted to the same sex. Humans do that. They do it for social reasons. But how this society came into existence may have God as an answer. No one says God is a leader. Today we look to politicians and humanitarian as leaders. Not all religions believe in heaven and he'll. God isn't restricted to particular religions or beliefs about his powers and control over beings. But the existence of a God cannot be disproved. You can have personal opinions, but the topic of this debate is that God is not real, which is an affirmative statement. This can not be proved with all certainty. The lack of existence of a creator cannot be disproved by any amount of science.	CON	469
S5732ba4d-Af0284d7a	Is This life what you think it is? Hell if you see life wrong maybe the place you end up.	"|| Clarification || While the resolution is seemingly non-sensical (poor grammar), I'd like to establish the case which I have agreed to debate my opponent on as discussed via PM: That it is better to live righteously by God's word and assume that Hell exists, rather than assume it doesn't only to wind up there and suffer. I have agreed to argue the CON position agaist this resolution (which is similar to the idea of Pascal's Wager). REBUTTAL: || The Existance of Hell || Pro notes that there is no physical proof that Hell exists. Because he has offered no proof or even a substantial argument defending its existence, we cannot assume that it does. At best, we can say it 'maybe' exists for the purpose of this debate. || God's Love || Pro proposes that all the love we feel - romantic or otherwise - is only possible through God's existance. Once again, he provides no proof for these claims, therefore we have no reason to accept his ideology. || Science & Love || Actually, almost every emotion we feel can be explained via brain cells (neurons and the like) and their reactions + our physical and chemical make-up in general. This is proven given the fact that science now provides medicine and medication to either tame or stimulate emotions (i.e. Xanax or other mood stabalizers). While I'm no physicist and do not wish to go in depth about our brain function, the fact remains that there is more proof that science (biology) and not God is responsible for the love (or any emotion) that we feel. Assuming you agree that God is responsible for our biological make-up, again, at best this point can only result in a stalemate, or the notion that MAYBE God is responsible for the love that we feel. || Jesus & Sin || Not only is there no proof that Jesus was a holy figure, but history now speculates the very nature of his existance. Thus, the points about ""spitting in Jesus' face"" are irrelevant. || Jesus & Santa Clause || My opponent has equated believing in Jesus and the Devil to believing in Santa Clause. Now because we accept that the story of Santa Clause is a fictional one we teach our children for their benefit (enjoyment), we must accept that Pro has merely made the point that the story of Jesus and the Devil is just a fable tought to people that is for their supposed benefit. While the intentions may be good, the reality is false. || My Case || Given Pro's evidence (or lack thereof), at best we can conclude that MAYBE there is a God/Jesus and MAYBE there is a Hell. This leaves us with a 50/50 chance based on the little proof or arguments Pro listed in his favor. However, considering my points that science can and has explained a lot of the questions or mysteries of the world (or at least what we have discussed in this debate: one's emotions), you should consider my reasoning that God probably does not exist, making the odds more in my favor. However, even if we establish the presence of a 50/50 scenario, I stand in affirmation of the CON position -- that it's better to not believe that Hell exists rather than live in fear of such a place. 1. Pro is assuming that there are only 2 options -- The existence of God or the non-existance of God. This is flawed, of course, given the fact that there are COUNTLESS religions in the world in addition to Christianity. Consider Islam, for instance, or even polytheistic religions such as Paganism. To assume that his religion or his idea of Hell is the only possible one that can exist is non-sensical and certainly not supported via his own arguments. Assuming that there are 1,000 versions of religion/God/Hell/the afterlife (and that's a significantly low number), the odds of Pro being correct are only 1/1,000... and that's being generous. Thus, logically we should assume that his presumption is wrong, and therefore it wouldn't be of sound reason to in fact agree with his depiction of God and Hell. 2. Suppose that the Christian God does not exist, but another god does and we deny his existence. Being blasphemous is worse than not believing, thus it would be better for us to not believe in any god rather than assert one's superiroity or imminent reign over another (when we have only faith to go by). 3. Following God's law often inhibits us from living our lives the way we'd like. For instance, it's considered sinful to engage in premarital sex. However, most of us believe that if we are safe and mature with our decisions, then our sex lives should be our business. Choosing to ignore our own human desires out of fear is no way to make the most of our lives here on earth. We must conclude that if no god exists, it's better to give our lives meaning and define our own existence, i.e. live our lives to the fullest or as best we possibly can based on our own moral beliefs. If we're wrong and God DOES in fact exist, the idea that he is all forgiving and merciful should mean that He would be understanding of our sin and our skepticism, as it is only human nature to seek truth and fulfillment. 4. If God doesn't exist, we will have wasted a lot of time (going to church, praying, etc.), money (tithings, religious ceremonies, etc.), livelihoods (consider those that choose the priesthood) and even lives (think about all of the holy wars). It almost seems as if believing in God and Hell means being willing to sacrifice our lives here on earth. The only thing is, we have proof that earth and humanity exists. We don't have PROOF (not based on faith) that God/Hell exists. Again, because of this, God - if one exists as they say he does - should understand our predicament. 5. God is supposed to only reward and save true believers. If one doesn't believe for any reason, to pretend that we believe or to force ourselves to believe would not indicate valid submission to the idea of God and Hell. Therefore what we believe is somewhat out of our hands. We don't have absolute control of our faith. Furthermore, we only believe what we do because that is what we are tought as young children. Surely God wouldn't punish those who were never given the opportunity to believe in Him based on the circumstances to which they were born. 6. A just god judges people for who they are, not for what their minds tell them is likely to be true or not. Therefore a just god would still save atheists if they were good people. Is it really likely that non-believers are sent to hell, only because their great minds didn't find any evidence of the Christian god? In that case the word ""just"" is not applieable to god, and such a god is not even worth worshipping. To worship such a god would be like worshiping your worst enemy because you were afraid of his revenge if you didn't submit to his power [1]. || Conclusion || I'll stop here for now, curious to see as what my opponent proposes next. If he attempts any type of intelligent rebuttal, I will continue debunking the resolution at hand. Good luck. Source: [1] http://www.update.uu.se..."	CON	470
S30b19de3-A3d37a4c5	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	"There may be no evidence to prove God, but there is no evidence against it. Both scientifically, and statistically, it is impossible to say there is not a God. Of course, the inverse is also true, you cannot say God exists. As for your statement about the Bible (of which all the texts I know the best), you have yet to provide much, if any examples. Sure, you believe that sheep herders writing a book is ludicrous, but you haven't given an example, or proven this statement in any way, this is still up for debate. The existence of God is very possible; the paradoxes do not invalidate the concept, similar Quantum Mechanics being vary paradoxical, yet perfectly reasonable, and actually very true... although I have never heard that he is ""spaceless and timeless"". God can be loving, and there can still be a Hell. Let us say there is a man, and his son. This man wants his son to grow, and live a happy life. So because of this, the father puts his son through school, and teaches him how to live life, and tells the son that if he does what the man says, then he will be happy and will be able to live life to the fullest. But if the son does not learn, and he becomes a stupid child, then he is destined to live in the slums. The man loves his son, and is willing to forgive him if he procrastinates, or fights against his father. If the son continues to do this until he has to leave, then the son WILL live in the slums, there will be no choice, not even for the father. It is impossible for the man to 'beam' his son to the high-life, because he will only fail, and go directly to the slums. The analogy is nearly perfect. The man is God, we are His son, the happy and healthy high-life is Heaven, and the slums are Hell. He loves his child, and wants him to grow, but he can't change that his child is in the slums. One more thing, ""a realm full of hell fire"", and such, are only analogies; you can't take the Bible literally. As for homosexuality, perhaps there is a reason God chose to impart this on us. Honestly, whether he does this or not is irrelevant to the discussion. Even if he does hate homosexuals, that doesn't make it impossible that he should exist. As for your belief in science, that is where you are wholly wrong. Science has nothing to do with belief. It is about evidence, hypothesis, and explanations. You can take your belief in science, and stick it in the mud. Science has never been, nor ever will be a belief system. Believing in science will only make a person who is biased to the opinions of the whole. Such would make a non-skeptical scientist, but we know that skepticism is one of the main pillars of it. You like to say that the holy books provide faith instead of facts, of which science provides. But if you believe in science, you are putting your faith in science, and that is illogical, and hypocritical. Honestly, most of your arguments have nothing to do with the existence of God. They either concern your misconceptions about the Bible, your own inability to understand a religion, or your blind belief in science, and those things are irrelevant to the existence of God. I chose to counter some of your arguments anyway, since I didn't want to alienate you (actually I wanted to help you understand), and your whole post."	CON	471

In fact, Mark Twain once said ""Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.""

S9958d011-Af2d2644a	Christianity is not real.	"I thank Con for accepting the debate. Now I shall state my point. There are uncanny similarities of Jesus to other people in history who existed before he supposedly did. Jesus Christ's life bears uncanny resemblances to many other people who also supposedly existed in history, some who may have even existed before him. This suggests that the life of Jesus Christ was fabricated. (1) Horus, Egyptian God - c.3000 BCE Political commentator Bill Maher confronted a Christian man about the parallels between the Egyptian God Horus' life and Jesus' life, and this is part of what he found. ""Written in 1280 B.C., the Book of the Dead describes a God, Horus. Horus is the son of the god Osiris, born to a virgin mother. He was baptised in a river by Anup the Baptiser who was later beheaded. Like Jesus, Horus was tempted while alone in the desert, healed the sick, the blind, cast out demons, and walked on water. He raised Asar from the dead. ""Asar"" translates to ""Lazarus."" Oh, yeah, he also had twelve disciples. Yes, Horus was crucified first, and after three days, two women announced Horus, the saviour of humanity, had been resurrected."" Maher. Summary of points Both Jesus and Horus were born to a virgin mother Both Jesus and Horus are the sons of God Both Jesus and Horus were baptised Both Jesus and Horus were tempted in the desert Both Jesus and Horus cured the sick, helped people, etc. Both Jesus and Horus died due to crucifying Both Jesus and Horus were brought back to life three days after their deaths Hmm, the similarities are uncanny, right? But that's not all. (2) Krishna, Hindu God - 3227 BCE to 3102 BCE Lord Krishna and Jesus Christ also have much in common. These are some of the similarities: Both Krishna and Jesus were born in unusual places. Jesus was born in a lowly manger and Lord Krishna in a prison cell. Both of them were divinely saved from death. Jesus came back to life after he died, while Krishna survived being brutally murdered by his uncle, Kamsa. Both of them were pursued by evil forces which tried to bring them down, but they both escaped on numerous occasions. Both died of wounds caused by sharp objects - Jesus died from being nailed to a cross and Lord Krishna was killed by an arrow. Even their names are similar! Krishna means 'dark in complexion' while Christ means 'covered in dark.' All of this is quite strange. It is almost as if someone copied the story of Krishna and invented a new story... (3) Buddha, main figure of Buddhism - Both Buddha and Christ preached many similar things, and Buddha lived many, many years before Christ ever claimed to. Here are some quotes from both of them that show the similarities of their teachings: Example #1 Buddha: ""Lose self to gain nirvana and escape from suffering."" Christ: ""Lose self to gain Christ and entrance into heaven, where there will be no suffering."" Example #2 Buddha: ""Consider others as yourself."" Christ: ""Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.""5 ""You shall love your neighbour as yourself."" Example #3 Buddha: ""Hatred does not ever cease in this world by hating, but by love; this is an eternal truth. . . . Overcome anger by love, overcome evil by good, overcome the miser by giving, overcome the liar by truth."" Christ: ""Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you."" Now this is getting ridiculous. It is literally the teachings of Buddha copied and turned into a book that makes up the Bible. The similarities between the stories of Christ and the stories of Buddha, Krishna and Horus are amazing. It is clear to see that the stories of Jesus have been based off these three people. Whether any of them are real or not is a different matter, but the stories of Horus, Krishna and Buddha existed long before Christ's story did, so it is only logical to say that whoever invented Christ's story copied these other stories.

On the other hand, the Queen represents an entity above politics, and the monarchy ensures that Britain retains sound diplomatic relations with other nations through state visits. It is also important to ask what would happen if the monarchy was scrapped, what would replace the Queen?	CON	475
S9e30175f-Adee54f07	Evolution is a Real Thing	"I must elaborate that this debate bores me. First thing first: Your Accusation. This is no argument at all? Thanks to you! Debate: To engage in argument by discussing opposing points. Argument: A discussion in which disagreement is expressed; a debate. Expressed: 1. To set forth in words; state. 2. To manifest or communicate, as by a gesture; show. 3. To make known the feelings or opinions of (oneself), as by statement or art. So legally, this IS an argument. You just fail so bad at convincing anyone. Yes, I am stabbing the belief of many people, there is no problem in that as long as civil discussion is being used, and the purpose is not to offend or incite them, but made toward a constructive purpose away from forgery and lies. Knowledge exists not to please, knowledge exists to inform. However, you attempted to stab me as an individual, thus you are as bad as you claimed me to be. ""You seem to be saying that evolutionists in particular ""avoid arguments""..... Forgive me for failing to see the logic in this statement."" Man... What possessed me to say such things? I wonder... *Super hint! You are the living fossil er... proof!* Btw, I forgive you ;) You must have a hard time making arguments... I understand. Since we cleaned the can of worms, lets get into the real stuff. The first statement ignores one of the points I left last for a PURPOSE, I did NOT put it there for fun. Therefore, I have the right to dismiss that point, However (Damn buts and howevers)... I am going to refute it in order to prove my point. The refutation have a very simple, but true answer. A THEORY CAN NOT PREDICT THE OPPOSITE. A theory can not create a hypothesis predicting the opposite of the theory, if it did then it is not science, it is child play since this would be a contradictory trick to keep the theory alive when science should attempt to destroy theories and replace them with better ones. Furthermore, what happened to ""Luck"" and ""Chance"" you evolutionists are so happy about? Does this mean evolution is based on intelligent design? if the chance is 10 base 50, it will never happen. The probability of producing a human cell by chance is 10 base 119,000. Make the math. And here is an other question: How do creatures evolve at the same time? If the luck from mutation and natural selection caused a creature to evolve into an other specie, then the said specie cannot produce on it's own. *Note, I am ignoring the flinch statement just like you ignored the refutation* Are you saying the book is made by one stupid person? They are not stupid, they are conspirators. Ernst Haeckel said that there are hundreds of fellow culprits in the forgery, and many of them are seen as respected and trustworthy biologist. “Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it because the only alternative is special creation which is unthinkable.” -Sir Arthur Keith ""Evolution is a fairy tale for adults.""I believe that is exactly what it is. In Grimms' Fairy Tales someone kisses a frog and in two seconds it becomes a prince. That is a fairy tale. In evolution, someone kisses a frog and in two million years, it becomes a prince. Tat is no science. It is simply a faith."" -Dr Duane Gish ""In the meantime, the educated public continues to believe that Darwin has provided all the relevant answers by the magic formula of random mutations plus natural selection-quite unaware of the fact that random mutations have turned out to be irrelevant and natural selection a tautology."" -Arthur Koestler Information for future Internet use: BTW = Trivial information. Therefore,what you wrote did nothing but make your argument seem longer, it is not like it is long anyway. Is that your super-reply to the subject?

As for your last point: Evolution: Living things (Like single cell organism) become more complicated living things by accident (Like a multi-cell organism). Spontaneous generation: Non-Living things create living things by accident (Like the first cell). As for the video, it is simply an imaginary scenario, not an argument, nor science. Arthur Koestler is a Hungarian-born British novelist, journalist, and critic: In the meantime, the educated public continues to believe that Darwin has provided all the relevant answers by the magic formula of random mutations plus natural selection-quite unaware of the fact that random mutations have turned out to be irrelevant and natural selection a tautology."

Sa2c4dff2-Af8af9ce	God is not real.	Your argument here, is complete fallacy. Fallacy - A mistaken belief, especially one based on unsound argument You claim that God doesn't exist, because there is no evidence to support Him. This is fallacy, because I can make the same, yet opposite claim. God is real, because there is no evidence to refute Him. Your argument is based solely on opinion, and not fact. There are no facts that say that God doesn't exist. Not one scientific equation says that God doesn't exist. Science seems to negate the story of creation in the Bible, but that really isn't the case. However, that's a much deeper argument, and for now, I'm going to keep it simple. God is good. If He weren't, you, I, or anyone else would be here. Why would you think that God is evil? God doesn't go around killing people, hurting people, letting people starve, etc.. People do. Not God, people. We must understand that God and religion, are no means the same thing. Man created religion, not God. Since the dawn of intelligent thinking, man has felt something greater than himself in the universe. It's man's interpretation of God that we have religion. Through this, we have come to have many religions and philosophies across the planet. Even some scientists, who don't believe in God, are coming to believe in intelligent design. I have Faith in God and His existence. You have faith that God doesn't exist. These are simply beliefs with no evidence to prove either way. We will not know the truth until our time is up on this beautiful planet. Which is why we should just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Telling someone they are wrong, or trying to prove someone wrong when there is no evidence to prove so, is wasting time. Why can't we just accept everyone's right to their own beliefs? If they aren't hurting anyone, then what is the problem?	CON	477
Sf48c7376-A68e4449c	Global warming is real	"The use of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change as a source is almost worse than having no sources at all. First of all, the page my opponent links to was written in 1998. But more importantly, this is an organization run by Craig and Keith Idso, both skeptics whose research has been funded by the oil-backed Heartland Institute: http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com... Hardly the most trustworthy source, but even if you don't think their questionable motivations are making them biased towards denial of climate science, I think a more reasonable way to determine how likely it is as laypeople would be to examine the consensus on the issue among scientists. Admittedly this is anecdotal evidence, but I actually predicted my opponent to cite the Idso family, because they are among only a small handful of actual scientists who try to convince the public that global warming isn't real. Why is this the case? Well, there is in fact an overwhelming scientific consensus on the issue: http://iopscience.iop.org... Several studies of this kind have been done, and they invariably find that somewhere in the range of 97% of climate scientists not only say that warming is real, but that it is anthropogenic. I think I have made my point abundantly clear that if we take into account what actual scientists say on this issue in the aggregate, it is no contest. But if you are inclined to believe my opponent's study, I'd like to point out that there is no real warrant to the claim that is made. My opponent gives the claim of his evidence, and then says ""it is clear that the rise in temperature caused it as the Center for Study of Carbon Dioxide says""-this is clearly a logical fallacy. If we are to place so much value on this study, there has to be a better reason than ""my source is clearly correct as my source says, thus I'm right."" This is the equivalent of saying it is correct because it said so, and he later repeats this by saying that I went on a rant about scientists ""but the study here was correct."" No, I simply said that these are marginal voices, and there are specific reasons to think the study was not correct. Just keep in mind that 97% of scientists think that what it said is false. I won't really address the oceans claim because it isn't really explained to the level of being an argument, but as far as I can tell it is about how much carbon the oceans contain which is utterly irrelevant as the greenhouse effect is driven by gases in the atmosphere, and the only source that has increased significantly within the last couple centuries has been human pollution."

S58afba79-Af92ac3da	The Holy Spirit is real	"First, let me get things straight. My opponent has already concluded confidently that the Holy Spirit cannot be proven as real because there is no physical evidence. Of course, I do not like debating anybody who has absolutely no open-mindedness (because it could be considered a waste of time). But I shall have fun indoctrinating RichardCypher and proving that his automatic conclusion is wrong. Second of all I want to remind you that I am not arguing for Creationism as this is not a debate about that. Instead I will have to let you research evidence (scientific, historically, observably) for God, but still showing a provable case that the Christian Trinity is not a myth. ""...anything someone claims the holy spirit done it is not practical reason because someone else can attribute the so-called act to a ghost, wind, fate, destiny, or logical order."" The Holy Spirit comes unlike we could comprehend because He is God and God is all-powerful. I say this because I believe that the Bible is God's Word and what He says in It is true, so I will have to have - faith - that our Creator God does not just have little assistants (Jesus and the Holy Spirit) who work with Him. DEFINITIONS AND INTRODUCTION Most people would say that Holy Spirit is the third part of the Trinity. The Trinity is 3-in-1 because there are three parts of one good God who created the earth. All the Creation evidence that can be seen throughout the universe and history is really eye opening and it all comes together when you read the Bible, because after all, it is truly His story that we are even here, living; it is part of His story that we are debating this. The very beginning of this magnificent story can be read in Genesis, chapters 1 through 7. We see that there""s more to it than ""God created the world and it was good."" Jesus and the Holy Spirit created it too, [1] and all of the creations were not just good, but perfect. That is, until the Devil tempted Adam and Eve which disrupted this perfect world. This is the Creation story and it is where things start to tie together. CHRISTIANS PROVE THE HOLY SPIRIT IS REAL I always wonder, if the Holy Spirit hasn't been around all this time, how and why have Christians been so involved and enthusiastic in their faith? Most Christians that I have ever known started off skeptical and seeing the logic in atheism more than believing in a guy up in the sky. But then they realized something, and in my opinion their eyes are opened when they experienced the supernatural gift and friendship that you can have as soon as you allow Jesus and His (the Bible""s) morals into your life and heart. [2] These Christians become not only devout and satisfied with their faith, but also they are still learning things and keep discovering more gifts from the relationship with God. This just seems too complicated for a person""s conscience to make up, as if the whole thing they call a relationship is a simple figment of their imagination. [3] Furthermore, this would mean that approximately 77% of the American adult population would be labelled mentally crazy, and that would cause a ripple effect of multiple controversial changes in the American way. [4] Who knows what would happen then. The point is: I challenge you (my opponent) to consider why Christians are so devoted if, when they read the Bible and it says you shall have a relationship with Christ and they end up not having one (as you say). And if I were to suppose that they are NOT all mentally ill, than why wouldn't the Holy Spirit be real too? The link for the TV series, called ""Encountering the Holy Spirit THE JORDAN RIVER,"" is on Round 1. I strongly encourage you to watch because it gives a thorough explanation of the Holy Spirit working and powerfully moving in people's lives. THE BIBLE (FIGURATIVELY) PROVES THE HOLY SPIRIT IS REAL By studying/reading in Genesis, we realize how the Trinity worked in the start of human history and how it is systemized so that all Three have roles even though they are all God. For example, John 6:44 says ""No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the prophets, 'AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me."" Then again in John 14:6, ""No one comes to the Father except through me."" [5] This is proof enough that God's Son (Jesus) and the Father (God) work(ed) in unity, as a tri-une God. You can see how the Holy Spirit has had and has now a significant role in this world. Everything I will explain will probably have a foundation coming from God's Word, but when explaining the Holy Spirit I will mostly be sharing stories of witnesses plus accounts of when the Holy Ghost has been seen and experienced. Here are some verses that have become real to people about the Third Person in the Trinity: Matthew 3:11 ""I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."" Acts 2:38 ""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."" In this verse, God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are united in works to make it possible for us to receive supernatural gifts and be released from all guilt and sins. Luke 11:13 ""If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask!"" God is saying here that even though we are sinful, we can receive nice gifts - just as we give gifts to our kids - and that the Holy Spirit is better than any gifts! This also explains why all around the Bible it says God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost are our friends who love and help us more than we can comprehend. This is who the Holy Spirit is. 2nd Corinthians 13:14 AND Philippians 2:1-2 ""The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."" Verses that can in a way prove the existence of the Trinity: Genesis 1:26 ""Let us make man in OUR image."" John 1:1 ""In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God. And the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God."" John 10:33 ""'I and the Father are one.' The Jews took up stones again to stone Him: Has it not been written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?"" Philippians 2:9 ""Therefore also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of those who are on heaven and on earth and under the earth, every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."" [6] THE UNIVERSE PROVES THE HOLY SPIRIT IS REAL This is an amazing fact that will be interesting for you to try to rebut. That the divine Trinity, the tri-une God, has created a great universe which is itself a trinity, with each of its three components also structured as trinities. This would not necessarily prove that God is a Trinity, but it is a fact that needs explanation. Could God have created it as a model (or type, or analogy) that would help people understand His own Nature, at least in some degree? The universe is all Space, all Time, and all Matter (including energy as a form of matter); in fact, many scientists speak of it as a Space-Matter-Time continuum. Each component permeating and representing the whole as the Universe. Furthermore, note the parallels between the divine trinity and the tri-universe in terms of the logical order of its three components. Space is the invisible, omnipresent background of everything in the universe. Matter-and-Energy reveal the reality of the universe. Time makes the universe understandable in the events occurring in it. Note that exactly the same sentence will apply if the words Father, Son, and Holy Spirit replace the words, Space, Matter, and Time. Space itself is also a tri-unity, comprised of three dimensions, with each dimension permeating all space. The reality of any portion of space is obtained by multiplying the three dimensions together (the ""mathematics of the Trinity"" is not 1+1+1=1, but rather 1x1x1=1). Further, Space is identified in the first dimension seen in the second dimension, experienced in the third dimension. The same sentence could be used with Father, Son, and Spirit replacing first, second, and third dimensions. Etc. etc with the Time and Matter, as time is present, future and past, and matter is unseen yet omnipotent Energy. [7] HISTORY PROVES THE HOLY SPIRIT IS REAL Considering the fact that the Bible is composed of many journals, song books, prophetic words, poems, and more journals, we can call it historical artifacts written from the perspectives of real people. Here are some verses that show the Holy Spirit working in the lives of people in the Old Testament. Ezekiel 11:5; Micah 3:8; Zechariah 7:12; Acts 28:25. CONCLUSION The Holy Spirit proves that God is real. The Holy Spirit proves that Jesus is real. And finally, the Holy Spirit proves that there is such a thing as supernatural activity, this can be witnessed most times you encounter a protestant church or a knowledgeable Christian.

You should have the time to read everything, considering that you seem young. Firstly, *Santa Claus is not real.* Evidence: http://www.wikihow.com... http://www.telegraph.co.uk... https://en.wikipedia.org... Please note that Wikipedia states that Santa is a mythical, legendary, historical and folkloric orgins... ""Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle and simply ""Santa"", is a mythical figure with legendary, historical and folkloric origins who, in many Western cultures, is said to bring gifts to the homes of the good children on 24 December, the night before Christmas Day. However, in some European countries children receive their presents on St. Nicholas' Day, either the 6th or 19th of December."" Although I do not want to spoil your perfect, happy, idyllic world and belief, I honestly do NOT think that Santa Claus is real. Unfortunately, not everything is true. You might have grown up with Santa Claus, but I never grew up with him. Listen. Firstly, your belief in Santa was probably instigated by your parents. I know it is hard to stop believing, (just like how I'm a Christian and how my parents told me that God is not real) but honestly, Santa does *NOT* exist. The book is lying. The book is obviously made for young children, something to induce imagination in a Child. Note that your English is good, considering that I originally thought you of a 7 year old. If you're trying to troll me, don't try. ""The book is infallible because it is the word of Santa."" It sounds like bullsh1t to me, but if I look at it from your point of view, it's like this: ""The Bible is infallible because it is the word of God."" Unfortunately God is real, proven scientifically, historically and logically, and is a widely held belief, and in my case, a fact. However, Santa is the exact opposite of this. I doubt Santa would have wrote the book personally, and I also doubt that his words have been passed down from generations to generations. Santa is mythical, and he is very *VERY* old. I don't think he can live for that long, tbh. ""In the book..."" Nah. The book is wrong. Even if it is correct, I haven't received a single coal in my life, although I don't believe in Santa. This is probably the main reason why your friends do not believe in Santa. Santa is a fictional character. Note that the Easter Bunny is false, and not exactly real. And it is a little too late to get mad. Your belief has been trampled on, ripped apart, crushed, destroyed, wrecked, rekt, shrekt, owned, trashed, pwned, since a long time ago. Santa is false, this truth may be hard on you, and I'm sorry, but honestly. Oh yeah, question time: How old are you? Did you give your wish list to your parents where they ""sent it to Santa""? You don't need to answer either of the questions. Just do something that I ask you to do this year: In your Wish List, put: -Lexus (Car. You can also put any car, like a Ferrari, or a Rose Royce) -Bungalow (You could put a mansion too, or a castle) -Immortality Potion like the one Chang'e had -Strength Potion that allows me to rival the strength of Gilgamesh/Hercules -Epic of Gilgamesh, Enuma Elish -Awesome Potion that gives you Omnipotence (God) -Potion that gives you the power of Zeus -Potion that gives you the knowledge of Athena -Potion that gives you all the good things in the world -Unlimited, infinite, wishes that will grant you any wish, and last you a perennial amount of time, a lifetime. But in your case, considering you're immortal, make it infinite and unlimited. -Potion that gives you the power of Time (Kronos) -Potion that gives you victory (Nike, Odin) -Sword of Grief (Grams) -Sword of the woman of the lake (Excalibur) -Sword of Arthur (Caliburn) -Spear of Heaven, made out of Uru, aka Gungnir -Etc.

S6d66188-A7f804694	where are the real republicans	"What do we mean when we say ""Real Republicans""? If the argument is that they should be conservatives (economically), follow the Constitution, and be non-interventionist, then I think there is no question that the current GOP no longer fits this description. However, why is that the definition of a ""Real Republican""? Yes, this was the definition of a Republican during World War One, the interwar period, World War Two, and perhaps for a bit after that. But the GOP has existed since the antebellum period. Why should we decide that the ""Real Republicans"" were the Robert Taft types and not the Abraham Lincoln types? If we are to accept the latter as our measure of a ""Real Republican"" then I think the current batch of Republicans (save Ron Paul) are very much ""Real Republicans."" A few criteria modern Republicans should fit if they are to be ""Lincoln Republicans"": Pro-centralization of government, protectionist, nationalistic, racist, little regard for individual rights, militarist, interventionist/corporatist in economic policy, and, in general, fascist. Let's see how they fit. Centralization of Government: The Republicans have long claimed to be ""federalist"" when it came to state's rights, that is, they are in favor of them. But how true is that? Republicans currently support national bans on abortion, homosexual marriage, medical marijuana (and illicit drugs in general), flag burning, stem cell research, and other things (depending on your Republican-of-choice, Mike Huckabee supports a national smoking ban, for instance). Also, we can look to immigration, where the Republicans all agree this is an issue for the federal government - despite this not being prescribed for the federal government in the Constitution and thus in the realm of the states. And what Republican (save perhaps Ron Paul) believes in the right to secession? Protectionist: Despite their claims to the contrary, almost every single Republican is a protectionist to one degree or another. Only Ron Paul supports real free trade - which is the simple, unilateral elimination of all trade barriers and tariffs. Republicans support sanctions/embargoes on Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq (after Gulf War 1), and various other nations, in spite of the fact that it impinges on the freedom of US citizens regarding trade. Republicans support fake free trade agreements like NAFTA (which is really just a tariff union), the WTO (which ""manages"" trade - sort of how socialism ""manages"" the economy), and all sorts of tariffs and barriers. Many Republicans are taking a ""hard-line"" on China - which means they want to put up all sorts of barriers to trade until the Chinese do what we want. Is all this really what free traders would do? The answer is no, and the Republicans who support this stuff are protectionists. Nationalistic: From their support of a Constitutional amendment to ban flag burning to their worship of all things patriotism to their support of the President no matter what, the Republicans are moving into hypernationalist territory frequently seen in countries like Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. I don't think there is any controversy over whether or not the Republican Party is infected with nationalism to the extreme. Racist: The whole immigration debate seems to make my point on this one. ""They're taking our jobs!"" is the call. As if the jobs belong to you. But what complaints are raised when jobs go to other Americans (and by this, I mean white Americans)? The fear of the Chinese and Japanese making our things is out of control as well, but what of companies in Europe? Are there protests against them? And all the hype about foreign oil? It is always the evil people in the Middle East. But what they don't tell you is the number one exporter of crude oil to the United States is Canada. And the number one exporter of petroleum to the United States is also Canada. But the issue here isn't that the oil is foreign. And the issues with China are not that their products are foreign and their labor is cheaper. The issue is that they look different and they are making things. And Republicans don't like it. Individual Rights: Mr. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus for the first time in the history of the United States of America. And so, in following with tradition, the Republicans suspended it once again in the 2006 Military Commissions Act. The Republicans of the modern age also launched the War on Drugs - perhaps the most invasive and rights-destroying policy in the history of the USA. As stated earlier, the Republicans are also looking to ban various things that individuals have a right to do on a national scale. Republicans also support the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which completely decimated property rights and freedom of association. Militarist: John McCain is a front-runner. Need I say more? The Republicans have gotten absolutely out of control with their ""support the troops"" and military spending. So-called ""fiscal conservatives"" also tend to be the ones to call for massive military expenditures. Republicans are war-hawks and try to compete in hawkish statements (leading to McCain saying things like it would be okay for us to stay in Iraq for 10,000 years). If you saw the last debate, there was a segment of probably ten minutes discussing if Romney is sufficiently dedicated to stay in Iraq, despite his constant rhetoric about staying ""until the job is done."" McCain got on him about not supporting the surge fervently enough. Non-interventionists like Ron Paul are laughed at, mocked, and generally considered to be RINO. Socialist/Fascist Economics: George W. Bush massively increase federal spending and the size of government. Even the Republicans admit it. They all claim to be for smaller government and ""changing Washington."" They then will go on to brag about how much they plan to spend on the military, police, border security, and the Drug War. The Republicans have claimed since Reagan that they wanted to get rid of the Department of Education, and it doubled in size under Reagan, it was increased dramatically under both Bushes (especially the latest with NCLB). They subsidize farmers, oil companies, and other ""vital industries."" They build and repair ""infrastructure."" They ""privatize"" Social Security not by letting you keep your money, but by putting it somewhere different than the Democrats want to put it. They support ""tax reform"" - which means tinkering with where the tax burden falls and, overall, raising taxes. They bail out companies that are ""too big to fail"" and support anti-trust to crush their more efficient competitors. They have supported price controls. They inflate and artificially lower interest rates. They spend, and spend, and spend, and spend. They regulate and keep big corporations untouchable. There are some, like John McCain, who hardly even try to hide their socialistic ideas. But do not be fooled by the others. They, too, are in support of bigger government, more spending, and higher taxes. The Republicans are not in favor of the free market - they are in favor of Big Government with Big Business. They are corporatists and/or socialists. Fascism: Above, I have described the general outline of what a fascist is. And what the modern Republicans are. This fits very well with what the early, Lincoln Republicans were and I think we should consider them the real ""Real Republicans."""	CON	482

Summary The conflicting alleged works of the Holy Spirit to cause Christians to speak in tongues aka languages is verifiable proof it does not exist, it is not real. Mentally ill? If God told man to write the Bible in his words and God told them to write ""speaking in (human) languages"", then why do Christians attribute speaking in (human) languages to babbling sounds? How come the Greek word for tongues in the Act chapter has the human meaning for human language--and not babble or an unknown word? An unknown word would be some convincing evidence that the babble Anita spoke was indeed the language of angels or God. Is this not the sign of mental illness, for multiple people to invent an undecipherable phonetic ramble and not use an actual language? Not only is it lunacy, its a fraud, and its laughable."	CON	483
S3796484f-A587c697b	Heaven is real	"There is proof but the problem with requiring proof to believe is that there is proof but the requirement on your part is to step into belief. At that time you will experience spiritual rebirth. The spirit is the ""receptor"" of things that will prove God's existence. This is about relationship not scientific evidence. You accuse God of condemnation when His Son takes that condemnation for you. It is not His choice that is condemning but rather yours. Tell a sick patient the only way to cure that cursed disease is with that medication knowing as the doctor that you are right but they don't act on your prescription because they don't believe it and they have sealed their own fate. You as the prescriber didn't kill them. it was the illness. That is similar to relationship with God. There are spiritual laws like physical, understanding them is critical to moving around in the spiritual realms. Being too intelligent can be a problem very difficult to overcome in becoming humble enough to even ask God to begin showing you what you need to see to help you believe. Your pride will block those things. Because you have an opinion of yourself as being too intelligent to let you believe superstitions if real evidence that you could get came your way it would blast right by you. All I know is once I was blind but now I see. I was once you but there came a day I was made humble enough to look up and beyond myself and His Spirit flooded in. I can show physical evidence except a changed life. Finally, I don't know how these exchanges sit with you cause I don't know you. I am always open to honest dialogue.

S224da923-A7e60a16f	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	Why does 2008 have any impact on what's happening currently? Barcelona's main two strikers back then were Henry and Eto'o(who was also their highest goal scorer in the league and scorred in the final against Man U) neither of which have played for Barcelona in years. Ronaldo, Kaka, Benzema, Xabi Alonso and Diara didn't even play for Real Madrid back then. At that period in time Man City finished 40 points behind Manchester United in the Premiership. As great as that Barcelona run is, it does not matter currently. Also 5 European cups in a row is a bit better. 2. As stated before Real Madrid are higher in La Liga by 5 points and have a better goal difference. They also did better in the current Champions League. Yet again these are statistical things from right now where Real Madrid are playing at a higher level than Barcelona. Over the 5 past La Liga seasons Real Madrid's point total has been 7 points higher than that of Barcelona. (1) 3. The last 5 matches between these teams has been 1 win for Real Madrid, 1 win for Barcelona and 3 draws. They played just 24 hours ago in a 2-2 draw where Real had in my opinion an unfair red card and a goal dissallowed. With many feeling as if Madrid were the better team. 4. As mentioned they both play the same position yet Ronaldo has scored more frequntly and hase been selected to the UEFA team of the Year 6 times compared to Messi's 4. 5. Saying Barcelona is a better playing team than Madrid is very subjective. As stated Madrid are doing better in La Liga currently and over the past 5 years cummitavely. They both play beautiful football yet one doesn't have to roll around on the floor for 30 minutes. It is fairly clear that Madrid are beating Barcelona at the moment in a league which better suits Barcelona whilst if they played in the more physical premiership or Bundesleague Real Madrid would cope better. 6. As stated Real Madrid has two Fifa World Players of the year on its team(2), whilst Barcelona have 1. As you conceeded Real Madrid have the better goal keeper. Real Madrid have scorere higher than Barcelona in each of the last 3 seasons in La Liga proving they have the more dangerous attack. For the World Cup Spain even picked more Real Madrid defenders than it did for Barcelona.(3) (1)http://goalzz.com... (2)http://en.wikipedia.org... (3)http://news.bbc.co.uk...	CON	485

Notably, In view of the importance attached to the apparent homology of the vertebrate skeleton, And the weight given to embryology for identifying homology, It is especially relevant that vertebrae "" a major component of the vertebrate skeleton "" form embryologically in significantly different ways for different classes of vertebrate (such as mammals, Birds, Amphibians and fish), And even from different groups of early embryonic cells.

They will insult with no credible explanations just insult What I really want to say is I know there is no god. I'll break it down very quickly my points and observations.

Next, as times change it becomes convent to make acceptations to who goes to hll based on social acceptance and/or directions.

I find it funny how some religious people skip over this fact…there are gay priest n now. You can't conveniently decide what's expect able, how can man just dictate what they feel is appropriate for the times; and why are these gods not intervening to correct such atrocities! I know why Quick point: Did you know the story of Jesus has been repeated throughout ancient history's' text- years before Jesus. Nope you didn't, that is why you are getting mad.

S1a699cf1-A3de8fe2f	ADHD is not real	"You say: ""You say that these are not specific traits, then what defines specific. Also one of these traits might not be specific on its own but the more and more traits you add, the rarer the combination is."" This is true, so if the symptoms where specific, such as hearing voices, severely impaired social skills and fits for example, then yes. If sufferers of all three symptoms where sparsely divided into the society, and over a wide range of social backgrounds, then it would be considered a biological problem. But the symptoms of ADHD go hand in hand. Difficulty paying attention in school, hyperactivity and high energy levels all go hand in hand. Its not like you wouldn't expect to see one without the other. This also suggests that it is organic, as its typical of a person who has a lot of energy too struggle to sit still for hours on end and learn about boring stuff. Its not like hearing voices or having down syndrome, its just a personality. You say: ""You show the example of one gene that is changed by environment, but fail to mention hundreds of others that are for the most part not."" Im sorry but where have you learned this? Genes are not set, the are like an instruction book for things that is only consulted when needed and is adapted to the environment. If genes where set then why, if I had an incredibly traumatic experience tomorrow, would the genes of my second child be different to that of my first? Also how do you think animals have evolved without genetic malleability? I cannot go into the details of genes and their relationship with the brain and the brains effect on personality. But let me tell you its not what 99% of people think, its far more complex. Almost ALL psychological conditions can be avoided. I accept that many people will never change, but this does not mean that there behaviours are built in from birth. Indeed they are built in, their brains are hard wired to that personality and their genes even reflect it, but it DOESNT mean that they HAD to peruse that route. The gene evolves in life in order to mean the requirements of the environment. Watch (humanbehaviouralbiology. Sapolsky) Or anything with Robert Sapolsky. Genes are read by other systems in the body that 'choose' what to read. For example if you put the gene that says 'put eye here' from a mouse into a fly, the fly will grow the eye there, but it will be a fly eye, not a mouse eye. Gene biology is still very much undiscovered, and so to simply say that hyperactivity and a low attention span for children in school is some kind of new unavoidable genetic condition, that needs medication and cannot be avoided, is ridiculous, lazy and even damaging. You say: ""being in the womb does affect personality, but only a tiny bit."" This isn't very scientific, we don't know how much it effects personality. It could even be a lot as this is the time when a person needs to learn as much as they can as quickly as they can about the world they are about to enter. But who knows, such a claim as you have made is not very accurate. You say: ""Every morning they would provide intense exercise of the children for an hour. Then the children were provided with specially trained private tutors, every hour they would have a break. And every Friday they would spend all day outside. That sounds pretty far from normal to me."" It doesn't too me. No offence to the school its doing its best and its not a bad approach, but they are not thinking outside the box. For pupils could only come to school once a week and pursue one of their interests at home or somewhere more appropriate depending on their passion. Who knows, the point is its still school, just more relaxed. And also there are other factors, general ignorance amongst the population about human psychology and human health, also media that makes children not see the point of an education, as so many their role models are violent action hero's or sluty women. You say: ""You say that the classroom caused it. Then why don't all children have it? Do some have some genetic predetermination that could be causing this? "" No. All children do have it, just not as much to be labelled as having it. And the reason why some children are less and more energetic than others, is because of their life. They all have had totally different lives. Everybody gets bored in class and looses attention at times, and we all can have days where we have more energy. Its not like schizophrenia where nobody can relate too you as your symptoms are things like hearing voices and other, alien behaviours. You say: ""ADHD might be becoming more common is genetics, if parents pass down ADHD to their children then it should be increasing exponentially."" It takes generations and generations for genetic disorders to spread throughout a population. And it would not be growing more and more in the more developed countries now, for such a trait would have been much more useful hundreds of years ago and so it would of spread now and not be on the increase right now. Summary. So a lot of people think ADHD is real because they no somebody with it, or even have it themselves. I don't mean to offend anyone I actually don't believe ADHD to be a bad thing. And by that I mean, I don't think having an energetic personality which is very spontaneous and creative is a bad thing. School is boring and we all know that, we know that we can be interested in science, but not like sitting a desk for hours on end learning about a specific piece of information at 9 in the morning. When all your mates are there and its sunny outside, and you live in a society with less authority than 50 years ago. Its hell for most students, don't be fooled by people saying they loved school when they are 22 or older. They are exhibiting positive memory syndrome, most of them really didn't like it 80% of the time. (20% being break time). (I must admit as you probably know, these figures are made up for no such research has been done, I ask the readers to ponder this point and comment with your opinion on this idea, its lazy I know). So people like this need to be properly engaged more than the rest of us do. 40% of people don't get 5 grade a to c in the UK at GCSE level. (1). Many of these are forced to do it anyway, and not necessarily because they actually have a passion for any subject. Most people get there heads down and endure it, others flunk it and don't really care, others cannot take the $h!t, and this is perhaps where the ADHD sufferers come in. They are not badly behaved children for this is nonsense, they are misunderstood and probably more effected by the obscenities in our society, for if they have the right environment and circumstances they can thrive more than 'normal' people. So to treat it like a disorder, a genetically determined 'problem' is wrong, it should be a sign to the government that we need change in our education system and change our culture. No that there is some fluke disorder that is spreading like a disease or something that means we must drug our children and sedate them! Insane. There is no evidence for ADHD. None at all. It is a term given to children who exhibit normal behaviours to an extent that is created by the observer. All it is, is a child struggling to concentrate (because they don't want to) in school, and having high energy levels. I believe the growth of ADHD in society is actually a result of growing disinterest in education (due to many factors); less discipline; a culture of instant gratification and comfort; a decrease in obedience to our elders and less value given to hard-work and thriftiness. Even somebody totally sceptical of this new understanding cannot argue that these factors potentially increase the chances of the symptoms of 'ADHD' occurring. We all know that the children of this generation are different with the way technology and culture is changing. Schools haven't changed its no wonder there is conflict. Do you really think its more likely that a fluke genetic disorder appeared and is now spreading across the country? Also genetic disorder that supposedly changes brain function, a thing now understood to be much much more complicated than that, something that is a reflection of the life it leads."	PRO	489
Sd686be90-Ad6b1b445	Santa Claus is Real	My counter arguments to your evidence. Exhibit a) http://www.wikihow.com... Exhibit b) http://www.theguardian.com... Exhibit c) http://hollywoodlife.com... As you can see my evidence is far more persuasive because it supports the existence of Santa Claus. Now, I am 100% certain of the existence of Santa and I will prove his existence to you. I have solid evidence behind the existence of Santa. 1. Look around you. Look at the presents that so many people receive on christmas. Clearly the presents had to be created from somewhere. The presents can't just spring into existence from nothing. As you know, something cannot come from nothing. Do you really believe that the presents just exploded into existence with a big bang and appeared right underneath the christmas tree? It is only logical to believe that the presents must have had a creator. There must have been intelligent design. And that is what Santa's elves are for. They intelligently design the presents. You can conduct an experiment. Try to snap your fingers and make a present out of nothing... See it doesn't work! 2. There have been many miracles and so many children have seen these miracles with their own eyes. The children plead to Santa by writing him a letter and he answers their wishes. If anything he actually seems to answer at least 90% of the time... unlike other things... While there is no camera evidence for some reason, I know that Santa can do many miracles such as fit his obese body down a chimney and fly into every single house in just a single night. That's like more than a million houses in just one night. Oh yeah! And Santa also has a bag that never seems to run out of stuff. Actually his bag gives out WAY more stuff... than some other person... I know that these miracles have never been caught on camera... Ever... but it's still evidence because ether are so many witnesses. 3. Without Santa there is no morality! Where do you get your morals?! Hmmm. At least I get morals from the fact that I know that Santa, an old obese man, is spying on me every second of my life. He watches me while a sleep. All night long. He watches me while I'm awake. He knows when I've been bad or good. This is why I have morals. This is why I act like an angel and I help people out. Because I know Santa will reward me. Where do you get your morals from? How do you know not to behave like an unruly brat? Hmmmmmm. In the great Book of Santa, know as the Babble, Santa clearly lists his ten Santa Commandments. I will list them for you. 1. Thou shalt have no other magical beings before me. 2. Thou shalt not make onto me any merry image. 3. Though shalt not take the name, thy Santa, in vain. 4. Remember the Santa Day, keep it holy. 5. Honor me for I am the one that gives the presents. 6. Though shalt keep thy hands to thyself 7. Thou shalt be loyal to thy playmate 8. Thou shalt share your toys 9. Though shalt not be a tattle tale 10. Though shalt not whine... and complain See, these are the ten commandments of Santa. These are great morals, and there is no way you could possibly figure this out unless you follow Santa. Santa also doesn't have a reputation of being a mass murder on a global level genocide... like some people. 4. Santa is omnipotent, omniscient, and forgiving! He has so much power and he helps so many children get presents. He has the power to fly at light speed, spy and millions of kids all at the same time, make millions of presents with just a few elves, and he has a bag that hold an infinite amount of things. He has all this power. I find it a bit strange that with this power he doesn't just feed every starving person in the world but whatever. Who cares that he lets evil continue when he has the power to easily stop it but instead he prefers to focus on insignificant wishes such as giving kids toys. Anyway, Santa is helpful to everyone and uses his immense power very wisely. And Remember, it's all part of Santa's grand plan. 5. When I put out the body of Santa (cookies) and the blood of Santa (milk), it always disappears. Santa must exist because he must eat his body and blood. 6. You see, the Book of Santa, The Babble, was written when Santa began giving presents. That was so long ago that nobody can actually verify if the book was actually written by Santa so therefore it must have been written by Santa because nobody was there to verify it. The existence of this book proves Santa's existence. 7. Even if I am... somehow... wrong about my belief in Santa at least nothing happens. I was wrong. At least I lived a life of morals. Nothing to gain, nothing to lose. But you. If you are wrong and Santa is real then guess what... you get big, fat, lump of coal! So what do you pick? A chance for presents? Or. A chance for a big lump of coal! 8. You cannot prove that Santa doesn't exist so therefore he must be real! 9. Santa sends his guardian elves to talk with me and he communicates with me personally. I have a very personal relationship with him that you can not disprove. Now that I am done giving my unbreakably strong reasons I will give my rebuttals. You say that my belief in Santa was instigated by my parents. This is absolutely not true. I could have been born in another family that believes in the easter bunny for example and I would still believe in santa and not the easter bunny because I know that santa is the one true magical being. You see, it is not my upbringing that decides which magical being I believe in but it's just that I know for a fact that Santa is real and the others are fake. I mean seriously! A bunny that hops around. How dumb do you need to be to believe that. And a fairy that flies around. Stupidest thing I ever heard. Santa is real, proven scientifically, historically and logically. Scientifically he is real because if he didn't exist then the atoms of the universe would not exist and as some random law of science states if you take those atoms out of the universe then you can not do that because matter cannot be destroyed or something. Historically, he has proved himself over and over with so many miracles. Also his book is to old to verify. Logically you use your brain to know that he exists because it makes sense to me and that is what I want. You mention that a widely held belief makes something true. One last thing. Say every single person in the world believed in Santa... except you. Would that make Santa real? Or not............................................................ WELL OF COURSE HE'D BE REAL! HE IS SANTA CLAUS!!!!!!! VOTE FOR ME THE PRO DUDE!!!!	PRO	490

Sa2c55bd3-Adc524706	God is not real	Your entire argument is based on the idea that the Christian god shares our own western morality. Asking why a benevolent God would do something is comparing his actions to what we in the 21st century deem moral and just. There is no reason to claim that we know the morality of this God, and so in his eyes any 'unjust' thing may be completely just. To claim God is only good if he falls in line with our current morality in the West is simply wrong, as morality has changed enormously over time, there's no reason to say we have reached true good and justice. Moreover you claim to comprehend the mind of this God in saying that if he were real, he would not do this or he would do that. This is a God that makes the rules themselves, it is entirely possible that we are wrong. Logic is a human creation and is our best attempt at explaining the universe before us. As such it is possible that we are wrong, which would be true if God's actions make no sense to us. If this God is omniscient, then it would surely know what does or does not make sense, meaning that we of course would be in the wrong. The fact of the matter is that religion is based on interpretation and so we would never know what the Bible truly means, nor will we know what the initial message was considering humans were the ones that documented it. We have no idea what this God intended when scripture was written, and so to claim there are contradictions would be true, but would not disprove the God, but simply prove that either humans made mistakes when they wrote the Bible, or simply that what we perceive as sense and logic are simply wrong. It is extremely unlikely that what most Christians believe is in fact true as their idea of God is founded on their own opinions and interpretations, which being only human are probably wrong. We may think that this God because of his rules is tyrannical and evil, but that doesn't mean he doesn't exist. There is no logical step from 'I don't like what he's saying' to 'therefore he must be wrong'. Of course things wouldn't make sense to us, considering we are not benevolent, omniscient, or omnipotent, and so have no possible means of empathising with a God. Regardless of whether you agree with scripture teachings, or if they don't make sense, this doesn't mean that God doesn't exist, but could mean that our view of morality, and our view of sense and nonsense, is wrong.

But we don't mean that literally. We just mean they're really good at it. The same thing is true of David. When he says he is sinful from his mother's womb, he just means he's an awful sinner."" Indeed. Practically any claim made in the Bible can be taken as a hyperbole. There isn't sufficient evidence to think that Psalm 51:5 is actually a hyperbole, unless the rest of the Bible indicates that babies aren't born sinful, or perhaps an indication of such. This is completely up for debate still. Please give a reason why you think it is a hyperbole other than that hyperboles exist. ""Psalm 51:5 says that David was sinful from the time his mother conceived him. It's impossible for that to be literally true because sin requires the faculty of volition, and volition requires mental states such as intention, desire, and the ability to act. A cluster of cells is completely incapable of having any cognition whatsoever, and it is also incapable of making any choices or taking any action. So it is impossible for David to have literally been sinful from the moment of his conception."" I would like Biblical evidence for the ""sin requires the faculty of volition"" statement, which this entire argument relies on. ""The whole of Ezekiel 18 argues against children sharing in the guilt of the sins of their parents. So not only do the unborn have no sin of their own, but neither do they bear the sins of their parents."" Ezekiel 18 is way too long to quote, so I will give a link to it here: https://www.biblegateway.com... Please read the entire chapter and come back. This entire chapter argues that a son will not bear the consequences of their parents sin. The story given in this chapter is also a hypothetical situation in which they have a presumable ""perfect"" son. Everything from Ezekiel 18:1-20 is summed up in Ezekiel 18:20 which says, ""The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them."" This does not mean babies are born unsinful. The conclusion you made is non sequitur. Please point out in Ezekiel 18 where it says the unborn have no sin of their own. ""In Isaiah 7, there's a prophecy about the birth of Immanuel. In verses 15-16 it says that Immanuel ""will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right,for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste."" This passage shows that people are not born with the ability to act morally (i.e. to choose between right and wrong). Rather, it's something they acquire some time after birth. It follows that the unborn lack this capacity and are therefore incapable of sin."" Again, the conclusion here is a non sequitur. You jump from not know how to choose right from wrong to not being able to sin. This passage shows that babies are unable to make the right decisions, not that they aren't making wrong decisions. It does not follow that the unborn lack this capacity and are therefore incapable of sin. They may not be conscious of their wrong doing, but that doesn't give them an excuse for sinning, at least not according to the Bible. ""Nobody can be morally accountable for what they don't know. Jesus said, ""If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains"" (John 9:41). He also said, ""If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin"" (John 15:22). James writes, ""If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them"" (James 4:17). Notice the condition James places on sinning. Before one can sin, they must first know the good they ought to do. But the unborn know nothing at all. From the moment of conception, they don't even have brains. The brain developes some time later. So it's impossible for the unborn to know right from wrong, which means it's impossible for them to be guilty of sin."" For this, I will have to go passage by passage. John 9 talks about a miracle Jesus did. Jesus healed a blind man. Then some pharisees came to stir up trouble. Please read John 9:35-41 which contains the majority of the important information. Here is a link: https://www.biblegateway.com... The title of this section in the NIV Bible is ""Spiritual Blindness"" which indicates that Jesus isn't talking about our eyes, but instead our beliefs. This not only makes the passages make more sense, but it also justifies the title. That being said, here is some commentary I found explaining what Jesus meant, since it was rather cryptic: http://www.studylight.org... Those who do not see are the ones who are spiritually blind. Jesus came to reveal the true son of god to them, that they may see. Those who see are the ones who are not worshiping the real god [note that this is different from the ones who now see from the previous sentence]. Jesus will make those people blind, showing them that their god is false, since he is the real son of god. Please read John 15:18-25 Link: https://www.biblegateway.com... By using the context of the passage, we that 'them' was Jesus was talking about the whole world. Since Jesus prophesied about everything he would do [starting in Genesis 3:14] and now Jesus is fulfilling said prophecies, nobody in the world has an excuse for sinning, even babies. James 4:17 doesn't define sinning. It only gives an example of sinning. Exodus 20:1-17, Galatians 5:19-21, and Colossians 3:5-6 are a larger but still incomplete list of sins. The condition that James gives is only for that type of sin. Rebuttal directly against Premise 2 Premise 2 says ""Aborted babies are without sin."" I will now present a large list of passages that support the concept of original sin, the idea that the moment somebody is conceived, they have sin. I hope that my opponent can go through each and every passage and give a justified interpretation for each one explaining how it is not evidence for original sin. Note: In Round 1, I never stated that passages in the Bible can't contradict eachother. These passages I will present will completely contradict all 5 arguments you gave for defending premise 2, if any of them still hold true after I refuted them. The best way to handle a situation like this would be that the person with the most evidence wins this argument? By evidence, I mean Bible passages supporting the concept of course. Some of these I will give a short explanation for. Others are really long and I will give a link to read it. 1) Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful from birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."" 2) Ephesians 2:2-3 https://www.biblegateway.com... We were by nature deserving of wrath. 3) Genesis 8:21 https://www.biblegateway.com... 4) Romans 3:23 ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god"" 5) James 1:15 ""Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."" Notice that death is a result of sin, hence aborted babies are sinners. 6) Isaiah 64:6 ""All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf,and like the wind our sins sweep us away."" We are all unclean, including babies. 7) Romans 3:20 ""Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin."" When we look at the god's law written in the Bible, nobody is righteous and we become conscious of our sin. Thank you and good luck. I look forward to seeing my opponent's rebuttal to my opening argument."	PRO	496

In order for your resolution to be complete, you must do this. You have simply put out random questions about God, and failed to provide the verse references I have asked for. However, I will do as best I can to save this debate. You claim that WE cannot create something from nothing, you are correct. Of course, WE are not the Christian God. You are probably getting the idea of nothing before God from the book of Genesis. God made sure to tell people that there was nothing before Him. Now, you say that this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible. I will now explain how God can be the first. The answers to your questions can be found in the first verse of the book of Genesis (first verse in the bible). It states: ""In the BEGINNING God created the heavens and the earth."" Here you can see that God was the beginning, God made time therefore there was no beginning before him. Two make it simpler for you to understand, here is an example. I raise my left hand at 12:30 PM, then my right hand at 12:31 PM. Since time does exist, you can see that before I raised my right hand I raised my left. There is no before and after if there is no time, therefore there was nothing before God. There are many other speculations about this, but this is the simplest. Either way, this part of your argument fails to prove that God does not exist. You ask why God does not simply give us signs to prove his existence. The reason is that he wants us to follow him because we want to, not because it is the 'logical' choice. If God showed up and said, ""I AM HERE! FOLLOW ME OR YOU SHALL GO TO HELL"" Then everyone would follow him because they have to. Jesus even told the demons to be quiet when they were talking about him being the Son of God. He wants us humans to have faith in him. This part of your argument also fails to disprove God's existence. Your last argument of it seeming like a bedtime story has nothing to do with your point. I could say the same thing about evolution! Once there was an organism who wanted to be a human. Then one day after waiting a long time, BAM, human! This does not prove that evolution is false. The reason the bible may seem like a bedtime story is that some parents like to tell their kids stories with morals in it. The Bible is full of them.

Sbaa6345c-A22b92690	Violent Video Games Lead to Real Violence (First Debate)	"I feel that just because a video game have the ability to glamorize illegal things (such as using and selling drugs, speeding cars, and murder) does not mean that people who play these games will actually do illegal things. If people are influenced by taking drugs, running red lights, or being violent in anyway because they did it on a video game then there is something else driving that person to do it. No moral and mentally healthy person would go kill people for fun due to a video game. No one wants to sell drugs due to it ""looking fun"". No one wants to get into a fist fight because ""why not"". No one wants to get police to chase them in a speeding car for the hell of it. There are definable other aspects in said persons life that would lead them to that. I think it is quite clear that people get desensitized to violence in general due to video games and movies, however that does not mean people are going to be violent. Desensitization of violence doesn't necessary mean you will be a violent person, but will not be mentally affected by it if you see it. On a personal note, I have been playing video games ever since I could remember with games like Pokemon, and Runescape. To this day, I am still a big gamer and have played most mainstream games. When I saw the Deadpool movie this weekend (extremely graphic), I did not freak out at the crazy amount of violence. I would say I'm desensitized to most violence, but I'm also basically a pacifist and never really hit anyone or got into a fight. I acknowledge this is my situation, but I wasn't raised around violence. I never really saw a real fist fight. Real violence wasn't around me, so that's probably why I'm a pacifist. But that is kind of my point, it's individual experiences that might make people violent, not from a role-playing game on a television. From my perspective anyone who plays violent games with a relatively healthy mind knows that these games are fake. Someone who is violent probably did not get it from watching fake scenarios of violence, like in movies or video games because it is clear it is fake. There is no urge (from a mentally healthy person at least) to go and try this in real life. I just don't feel that anyone who is a normal human being would take something from ""Grand Theft Auto"" and go steal cars, kill police, and punch hookers. I just don't see it happening. Again I do see the desensitization of violence, but I don't see it causing extra violence in stable teenagers (or anyone for that matter). I keep saying ""stable"" and ""mentally healthy"" because if someone has a mental problem they might do something crazy from an idea a video game gave them, but that's not exclusive to video games.

S58afba79-A1ece37d6	The Holy Spirit is real	"This round is all rebuttals: ""...But I can't prove to you I saw a ghost regardless if you saw one too at another time, in another place. I can't prove to you aliens exist regard if you believe it or not."" You cannot feel or experience aliens or ghosts, because according to the stories, aliens are their own species and they do not rule anything and ghosts are dead people who come back to 'earth' as souls; all unlike the Holy Spirit therefore irrelevant to the subject. The Bible can be figurative and still prove something, am I wrong? Besides, I didn't say the Bible is figurative, I said 'figuratively speaking the Bible proves the existence of the Holy Spirit.' God's Word describes who/what the Holy Spirit is; this obviously doesn't just prove that the Holy Spirit is real yet shows us how we know that 'speaking in tongues of men in angels' is from the Holy Spirit. New resolution for this statement - so that you can further understand - is ""Non directly the Bible proves the Holy Spirit is Real."" I want a rebuttal for my argument concerning that the Universe is evidence for the Holy Spirit and what do I get? A typical atheist answer: ""Well, actually it literally proves matter exist--nothing else."" Let me ask you, how did the matter get there? It came out of thin air...oh wait, in the very beginning there WAS no air...hmm? The very fact that what I explained is true is proof that a Creator is quite likely and that the Holy Spirit is part of the tri-une, almighty Creator God. New resolution for this statement so that you can understand me better: ""Science proves the Holy Spirit is real."" All your rebuttals have been wasted because of your 1) ignorance, or 2) misunderstanding on my argument. ""Copi says that only evidence of something that exist or occurred is provable. And if it did actually occurred qualified investigators would like find some evidence of it."" The first video you posted is proof that there have been investigations on the events and occurrences and these investigations turned out positive and proving that the Christian's claim is true. About the video you posted (speaking in tongues medical study proves), I do not see why it is faulty. ""There is nothing about that video that proves a holy spirit. Just a bunch of Third World Pakistanis adopting a practice historically shown to have slaughtered the same race of people."" There is nothing about that last sentence that explains how hundreds of people literally crash to the ground in seemingly trances, sometimes shaking violently and other times talking in Tongues. I extend my argument and wish you would please rebut. Acts 2 you showed but did not point out anything worth talking about. '1. There is no physical evidence or eyewitness testimony apart from the bible that this event really occurred. No one secular historian has ever produced authenic evidence this event took place."" Well obviously, because he's secular! And can you prove that the Bible is not made up of authentic journals that proves the writers are not eyewitnesses themselves? You have been dismissing that thought and moving onto ridiculing it's contents. Stop jumping to conclusions, please. I went to 1:48 of that medical study video. Nothing but truth comes from those mouths. Is this investigation, run by real medics and scientists, not enough to prove it is not a language? And if you watched the whole thing, you would know why Anita says those syllables. BECAUSE it is HER language personally given to from the HOLY SPIRIT. The vid also pointed out how everybody has a different Tongue (a.k.a. Heart) Language. ""If God told man to write the Bible in his words and God told them to write ""speaking in (human) languages"", then why do Christians attribute speaking in (human) languages to babbling sounds? How come the Greek word for tongues in the Act chapter has the human meaning for human language--and not babble or an unknown word? An unknown word would be some convincing evidence that the babble Anita spoke was indeed the language of angels or God."" Think of your childhood when you were around 5 or 6 years old. When I was that age and I heard foreign languages, I would not know what they were saying and also laugh because it entered my brain as gibberish. It wasn't identifiable to me and are not to anyone who doesn't speak the language. You do not have a source for that Greek claim so I will wait on that. ""Is this not the sign of mental illness, for multiple people to invent an undecipherable phonetic ramble and not use an actual language? Not only is it lunacy, its a fraud, and its laughable."" You have proven my point. Approximately 77% of the American adult population are now labelled mentally crazy by you. First I ask you, why would all those people CARE or even bother creating a whole language, practicing speaking it, and then spending half their lives at church worshiping a figment of their imagination and posting YouTube videos about it? That's a huge ""fraud."" Second of all, I'd like to see you try to speak the way Anita did. If you can do that exactly show us all. Then what will be laughable? My summary is that the Holy Spirit has not been disproven by you, so I hope you understand my argument better now so we can seriously debate."	PRO	503
S91b6b3a2-A5b751151	The Christian god sends aborted babies to hell.	"This will be a defense of my opening in light of Pro’s rebuttal. In my opening, I made this argument: 1. If aborted babies are without sin, then the Christian God does not send aborted babies to hell. 2. Aborted babies are without sin. 3. Therefore, the Christian God does not send aborted babies to hell. In his rebuttal, Pro conceded my first premise but disputed my second premise. I gave five arguments for the second premise that included a rebuttal to Pro’s argument against it in his opening. Let’s see how he responded. 2.1 David was sinful from conception I argued that David’s statement was a hyperbole. Pro conceded the possibility but challenged me to give a direct reason. In fact, I did give a reason for why we should take it as hyperbole. We should take it as hyperbole because it conforms to a well-understood hyperbolic pattern—saying that somebody was born with a banjo in their hands. I also argued in subsequent points that a literal interpretation is impossible. 2.2 No volition Here, I argued that since the unborn (especially in the earliest stages of development) do not have the faculty of volition that they cannot sin. Rather than denying my argument, Pro just requests me to support my claim that sin requires the faculty of volition with scripture. The support for my claim comes from the very meaning of the words, “sin” and “volition.” Sin is when one does what they shouldn’t do (1 John 3:4) or doesn’t do what they should (James 4:17). Doing and not doing are acts of volition. One cannot obey or disobey the law without the faculty of volition. 2.3 No inherited guilt. I argued this point from Ezekiel 18. Pro seems to agree with me. He even quoted the conclusion of the chapter, which says “The child will not share the guilt of the parent.” Pro’s response is that the passage does not say the unborn have no sin at all. But that response commits the strawman fallacy. The point I meant to make from Ezekiel 18 is that children do not inherit their parents sin. This point was meant to stand beside my other arguments which showed that the unborn do not commit sins. If children neither commit sins of their own (as I showed in other points), nor inherit the sins of their parents (as I showed in this point), then the unborn are sinless. So this was not a stand alone argument for the sinlessness of the unborn; rather, it was part of a cumulative case against the sinfulness of the unborn. 2.4 Age of accountability I argued from Isaiah 7 that prior to some point after birth, people cannot choose between right and wrong and therefore cannot be guilty of sin. Pro seems to think that although the passage does support the notion that the unborn cannot “reject the wrong and choose the right,” they nevertheless can choose the wrong. But that is clearly a misunderstanding of the spirit of the passage. Granted, the passage does not explicitly say that the unborn cannot choose the wrong, but surely it is implied that they can choose neither right nor wrong because they are not moral agents. 2.5 No knowledge Here, I argued from various scripture that one cannot be guilty of sin unless they know right from wrong, and the unborn know nothing at all. The first scripture was John 9:41. Pro’s explanation of the passage seems to be consistent with mine, so I don’t know how he thinks it amounts to a rebuttal. He’s right when he says it’s about our beliefs. If we are blind in the sense that we lack knowledge, then we cannot be guilty of sin. The unborn have no beliefs, therefore no knowledge, therefore no sin. The second scripture was John 15:22 where Jesus said, “If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin.” Pro argues that because Jesus is referring to the “world,” and the world includes the unborn, then Jesus must be implying that the unborn have no excuse for their sin either. But the context indicates that “world” does not refer to every living person. Rather, it refers to those to whom he spoke and those who witnessed his miracles. In verse 24, he says, “As it is, they have seen [the miracles], and yet they have hated both me and my Father.” In the New Testament, “world” hardly ever refers to every single person. It is plainly evident that no unborn person has ever seen Jesus’ miracles nor heard him speak, nor heard anything about him. They have no knowledge of Jesus because they are incapable of having knowledge. If a person who has no knowledge can have no sin, then the unborn have no sin. The third scripture was James 4:17, which says that anyone who “knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it” sins. Pro replies that it’s not the definition of a sin but only an example of it. I grant that. But sin is either doing wrong or not doing right. James 4:17 shows that before one can fail in doing right or wrong, they must first know what they ought or ought not to do. So even though James 4:17 only gives one side of the coin, it still shows that knowledge is necessary for sin. Pro’s arguments against my second premise Pro says, “I never stated that passages in the Bible can't contradict each other.” However, Rule 4 says, “Assume the Bible is 100% truth.” A contradiction is a certain indication of error, so Pro must assume no contradictions in the Bible or he violates Rule 4. Pro gave seven scriptures to disprove my second premise, to wit: 1) Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful from birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."" I have already responded to this. 2) Ephesians 2:2-3 We were by nature deserving of wrath. The “we” in this passage refers to those who, prior to conversion, were “gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts.” Obviously, that doesn’t refer to the unborn since they have no desires or thoughts. 3) Genesis 8:21 Genesis 8:21 contradicts Pro’s view. It says that “every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood,” not from conception. 4) Romans 3:23 ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god"" Pro takes “all” to mean “every single person” but “all” is used frequently in the New Testament to a limited group. For example, in Romans 5:18, it says, “Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.” If “all” means “every single person,” then this would lead to universal salvation. But Pro and I both reject universal salvation. So “all” does not mean “every single person.” 5) James 1:15 ""Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."" Notice that death is a result of sin, hence aborted babies are sinners. This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. It goes like this: 5.1 If you sin, then you die. 5.2 The unborn die. 5.3 Therefore, the unborn sin Pro’s argument from James 1:15 is logically invalid. 6) Isaiah 64:6 ""All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf,and like the wind our sins sweep us away."" We are all unclean, including babies. Pro again mistakenly takes “all” to mean “every single person, whether born or not.” The “us” in Isaiah 64:6 refers to morally aware Israelites. The unborn are not moral agents, so they are not included. 7) Romans 3:20 ""Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin."" When we look at the god's law written in the Bible, nobody is righteous and we become conscious of our sin. Obviously, before the brain forms, the unborn cannot be conscious of sin. They can’t be conscious of anything at all. The unborn can neither obey nor disobey the law because they lack knowledge of the law and they lack the faculty of volition. Conclusion Since none of the seven scriptures Pro brought up refuted my second premise, my second premise remains unrefuted. And since Pro’s attempts to refute my arguments for the second premise all fell short, my arguments still establish that the second premise is true."	CON	504

Another point that I'd like to make is that the people who you say believed in the dome above flat Earth are all ancient civilizations, including Greeks, who frequently made human sacrifices (Check out Ancient Sparta History, they're freaking nuts), Egyptians (Who worshiped bugs, cats, and dreams), Sumerians (worshiped the dirt, water, wind, and a bunch of other crazy things), Celtics ( They have a god about RABBIT MAGIC.), and Jews (ask a Modern Day Jewish person if they believe the Earth is flat.) Another question I have is how we are still staying on the surface. Wouldn't it make more sense that we are all being pulled down by a central force, instead of standing on the edge of a Flat Earth. What is the flat Earth suspended on? Is it just flying? Or is it just hanging on something? Also, since most flat-earthers are Christians, I'd like to point out that the Vatican (which is one of the heads of Churches) made a statement comparing Donald Trump to flat earthers. I will leave the link at the bottom of the article. So, not even the head of the Catholic Church believes that the earth is flat. Another point is that you said there is a ""dome"" How would that explain, that We have sent multiple spacecraft and rockets costing millions of dollars, that large groups of people have witnessed large rockets flying into the atmosphere that cost incredible amounts of money, that they're just bumping into a dome. What is outside of the dome? Is it nothing? Is it Heaven? Is it Hell? What would happen if we were to ""fall off"" the edge? Also, I have one more point to make. How would it be possible, that all, and I mean all governments have the belief that the Earth is round. If so many people believe it, then why isn't it more widespread? I wish I had more time, but I slept earlier than I normally did, so I didn't have much time to write this. I look forward to your views on this."	PRO	507
S6cca42d6-A4454d973	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (take 2)	"Looks like this is my last post on the subject. I will address your responses to my arguments and keep it at that. As a note, in debates past people have had a nasty habit of switching arguments in the last speech. Don't do this – it ruins competitive equity. 1) Your response indicates to me that you have not understood my objection in any form, but have followed in the footsteps of your first post and just restated the Christian perspective. You say ""Yes, God has the power and the desire for everyone to go to Heaven"". That's it. Case closed. I win. If God has the desire for everyone to go to Heaven and the power, then it will happen. No other outcome can result from him having both power and desire. But, I take it you don't see it this way, so you seem to have a few responses: a) ""Just because someone has the desire to do something does not mean they will do it."" This is true, but it ignores the point about God having power AND desire as we both have conceded. If I want to get a new car and I can get a new car, I will get a new car. Now, you might object that your parents do want a new car and they do have the money, but they keep their old car. The problem with examples like this is that other desires (the desire to have money for basic necessities) is outweighing the desire for a new car. When I use desire, I mean as a totality. If we weigh your parent's total desires and we see that on the whole they want a car and they can get it, they will, by definition have a car. QED b) ""Yes, God has the power and the desire for everyone to go to Heaven. But we as people have to take certain steps in order to be able to enter Heaven."" You seem here to actually be arguing that God does NOT have the desire for all people to get into heaven because he wants us to engage in certain steps. First, this directly contradicts your statement that God wants us to get into Heaven, so I can't be expected to effectively argue with your self-contradictory assertions. But, if I had to try, I would argue that this begs the further question of why God would require these steps. In the end, you response makes no sense which is funny because it is the standard Christian response. 2) Your response is ""we were all created by God to worship Him"". Explain to me why an all-powerful God would want us to worship him. It can't be for his benefit because he is all-powerful and cannot, by definition, need things. It also can't be for our benefit because the best possible scenario is for us to go to Heaven. So the response makes no sense. 3) For a third time, you have no answered my objection. How is it just for the finite transgression of ""have not done the things required to enter Heaven"" to lead to the infinite punishment of Hell. You have just explained the Christian perspective once again. CONCLUSION: my opponent fails to interact with my arguments in any significant way, implicitly conceding all of them. Especially telling is my opponents admission that God both wants to send people to heave and has the power. No matter what she says from here on out, there is no way she can get around explicitly admitting that my argument is correct in this way."	PRO	508

And yes, I have read the Bible, the Quran, the Torah and many other religious texts. There are prevailing themes throughout. Live a life where you do no harm to others, and be charitable and mindful of others needs. If you do this God will reward you, or you can reach a state of being unbound by the forces of the universe. All people of religion share a commonality of thought when you get to the basics; we should not be so easily dismissive of other faiths.

Sd3b36db4-A116d0440	Homosexuality is a sin and if one continues in the sin, then it will sadly lead that person to hell.	"My opponent starts by saying that many people in our world do not understand the concept of ""love"". I agree. If you choose to condemn another human being on the basis of the gender of the person they love, then you do not understand love. If you think that a loving god would condemn someone to eternal torture because of their sexuality (or indeed for any other reason), then you do not understand love. And if you profess that to get around this dilemma, that loving god killed himself, to appease himself, so that all may be forgiven as long as they become his willing emotional slaves on earth, then you do not understand love. My opponent has much work ahead of him in this debate. To win it, I submit that the burden of proof is clearly on him to show that homosexuality is a sin, and that 'if continued in' (whatever that means) that person will be sent to hell. Now sin is a word that only has meaning in a religious context, and my opponent makes it perfectly clear that he is arguing from a Christian context. I am not however prepared to concede unchallenged that the Bible is the inspired word of God. If my opponent wishes to argue that the Bible condemns homosexuality and therefore that homosexuality is a sin, then he must first demonstrate that God exists and that the Bible is an accurate reflection of his message to humanity. Only then will the argument he articulated above begin to have any weight. Furthermore, the burden of proof is also on my opponent to prove that hell exists and that all homosexuals will be sent there if they 'continue in the sin.' Furthermore, he must also clearly define what he actually means by this phrase. My stance on this matter is very simple. A significant minority of the human population feel romantic and/or sexual attraction towards those of the same sex. The reasons for this attraction are unknown. [1] No single 'gay gene' has been found, but current evidence suggests that this state of affairs is largely determined by genetics and random environmental factors. [2] Whatever the exact truth, there is no evidence to suggest that in the general population one's sexuality is a simple choice, in the same way that one can choose which clothes to wear or what music to listen to. Some members of the population also claim that homosexual behaviour is immoral. They claim, as my opponent does, that it is a sin, and against the law of god. However, not only can they not demonstrate with any reasonable degree of certainty that this god even exists - their best (and by and large only) evidence for this is an ancient collection of confused and contradictory writings by scientifically illiterate men, which cannot be taken seriously as a truthful message by anyone today - but they can't even come up with a rational explanation as to why that god would outlaw homosexuality. The simple fact is that if god exists, if he is good and if he says that homosexuality is a sin - all things claimed by my opponent in his first statement - then there will be a good, rational reason as to why he would do so. So I ask my opponent: what is that reason? I will now turn the floor back over to my opponent, and I look forward to his response. [1] = http://www.apa.org... [2] = http://esciencenews.com..."

S74fdcbb5-A6f2350c1	God Is Not Real	"My opponent states that ""If there is an intelligent being, that exists outside of time, that being cannot think, or do anything."" This seems contradictory to me since an intelligent being by definition can actually have coherent thoughts. Then my opponent asserts that change requires the passage of time. But the online dictionary states that change is ""to become different"" (http://www.merriam-webster.com...). Nothing about the definition makes it so that change is dependent of the existence of time. And besides, the fact that time/universe had a beginning proves that change is not contingent on time. In other words, time went from not existing to existing. Therefore change has happened without the existence of time. Then it is stated that ""If time began at the same time as the universe did, then there was no point in time where the universe did not exist, as they came into existence at the same time. The universe has technically always existed."" The problem here is that time (the universe) itself began to exist. My opponent actually acknowledges this in that very quote. This means that before time existed, there was no universe. While it is true that the universe has existed since the beginning of time, the universe did not exist before the existence of time. And again, red-shift and thermodynamics show that the universe had a beginning. Then it is said that ""I understand that the Christian interpretation of God claims that God is eternal, but it fails to back up these claims."" It should be noted that my opponent in the beginning of this debate asked me to show that the God as defined by the Bible as the true God. But what I have done is proved that the cause of the universe would have to eternal. And by definition, the Christian God is eternal (John 1:1-5, John 8:58, Genesis 1, and etc...). In other words, since the cause of the universe has to be eternal, and since God by definition is eternal, this is evidence that God is a possible explanation for the universes existence. But when we see that the cause also has to be omnipresent, omnipotent, moral, and etc...we see that a God is the most plausible explanation for the universes existence. Then my opponent says ""If morality were objective, everyone would share the same moral opinions. If our morals were taken directly from the Bible, adulterers would be stoned, no one would eat bacon, and trimming your beard would be seen as immoral."" The problem here is the lack of understanding of each law. These laws were intended for a specific theocratic system in which God's morals were enforced by the government. Sin was not tolerated or encouraged in any way. So I assume you would agree that adultery is immoral. The part in which you have issue is the punishment that was carried out. So we both agree that adultery is objectively immoral. As for eating bacon (did you mean pork?) and shaving beards, these laws were established to prevent Israel from becoming anything like the other sinful nations that were sacrificing children. God wanted to make his people completely separate from them and that is why these laws existed. Basically, a person wasn't immoral for eating pork or shaving, but they were immoral for disobeying God. Then it is assumed that a person shaving ""would mean that you are an immoral person."" This isn't true. The laws dissipated when the bad influences did. The basic morals values are always the same. But the laws change based on different scenarios. It was then stated that ""these are moral standards that exist today, but they did not exist in the past. Early human tribes saw murder and stealing within their own tribe as immoral, but the stealing from, and murdering of other tribes was an acceptable thing to do."" Not only is this a bare assertion, but it seems to indicate that people in the past thought murder was moral. But this just isn't true. People have always thought that murder is wrong. While my opponent mentions different tribes, he doesn't give specific names. But in all of these cases, the tribes had a reason to take things from other people so it wouldn't seem like murder/stealing to them. The tribes would just see it as justified killing. Perhaps the tribes the were taking something back that belonged to them or maybe they were going to war for a valid reason. Or maybe they did these terrible things knowing that what they were doing was wrong. The point is that even tribes recognized that murder was wrong. Does this mean that they will recognize their action as murder? Or does this mean that then won't do bad things even though that their action is wrong? Absolutely not. Then my opponent makes several assertions: ""Eyewitness testimonies should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are just one person's word against another person's. People who disagreed with these testimonies would have been left out of the Bible. You are accepting that these testimonies are true without any evidence that they are. Eyewitness testimonies are often very inaccurate."" When looking to see if an account is true or not, we should see if other accounts disagree with it, and if facts are distorted. There are four gospels and the brothers of Jesus even wrote letters confirming that they were now believers. None of them contradict each other and no other eye witness testimony contradicts the gospels. So since nothing disputes what the gospels say, we have no reason to distrust what they say in that aspect. As for facts, the gospels mention real places https://carm.org...), events (http://www.christiananswers.net...), people (http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org...), and include embarrassing details that add to its reliability. So there is good reason to accept what the gospels say. My opponent then says ""that Jesus could have just been lying, and not insane."" The problem here is that people do not die for a lie. Jesus was literally crucified and he could have avoided this death by ""telling the truth."" But not only that, you can't be a good teacher (as historian Josephus called him) and be a liar at the same time. So it is more plausible that Jesus was who he said he was. Then my opponent asks ""I will assume that you have lied, at least once, as every human has. Are you saying that you are evil?"" My answer is yes. If any human does something wrong, then this means that they are a wrong doer. Remember my fruit analogy? When a fruit gets bruised, it is no longer perfect. Same thing with humans. Once we do something wrong, we are evil. It was then asserted that ""the Bible claims that God decides when we die. (Job 14:5) If this is the case, the Nazis were only fulfilling God's will."" The verse in Job does say that God appoints a day for us to die. But it says nothing about using Nazi's to fulfill his will. God never forced any person to murder anyone else. However, he does allow murder to happen (freewill) and allows people to die. My opponent says that ""there is evidence of common ancestry. All cells are put together in the same way. Humans share 96% of our DNA with chimpanzees, our closest living relatives."" To some people, this would be seen as evidence for common ancestry. But for the Christian, it is evidence of a common designer. The fact that all living things are made of the same materials show that they were all made by the same being. That particular evidence equally supports a common designer and a common ancestor. As for the age of the earth, the Bible does not specify the age of the earth. While the time between events does add up to over 6,000 years, that calculation is not including the days of creation. And the days of creation could have had time between them and there could have also been a long period of time before the first day of creation. So the Bible does not exclude the possibility of an old earth. I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate. It is always a pleasure to debate them and I hope some things have been cleared up. it should be noted that the cosmological argument for God was not refuted and neither was the argument that had to do with Jesus. Most time was spent discussing other questions. I don't mind this at all but I think the resolution was obviously changed into ""can a Christian answer my questions."""	CON	512
S13093194-A6297ddc8	"The concept of having a pool of ""real names"" to choose from is absured and discourages individuality"	"Thank you for accepting my debate. I will take this one at a time… ""But, by then on, you see that my opponent has clearly been given the impression everyone can choose their own names…"" It is impossible for an infant to consciously name themselves…so obviously the best party to provide the name is the parents. At first glance this may seem to prove that a name is not a unique title to represent the individual. We may ask our selves: ""how can this possibly be a definition of me, if someone else invented it?"" In reality, we define our names, and appropriate them and make them our own. The actual vocalization of the name is, in the grand scheme, irrelevant. The important factor is that they are unique, so that they may become an individual title for us. I assert that it is, for the most part, irrelevant who invents the actual vocalization of the name. ""Now, when I hear the term ""real names"" I am under the impression he means currently existing names. This is a farce on my opponent's side as a pool of ""real names"" would actually encourage certain parents to be original and make up names that would correspond to their originality. If a pool of real names were to be introduced, parent's with originality would most likely use it... The originality, that is. Therefore, a pool of real names actually encourages naturally original parents to be just that."" There is a clear social expectation that a child be given a name that is already deemed a ""real name"". When I say ""real name"", I mean a name considered to be a real name by society. To try to deny such a pool of ""real names"" is silly. In fact, some people have gone as far as to try and outline all of these real names, such as this site: http://www.babynames.com.... While many of these names are lesser known, and would be considered to be fake, by many people, it certainly proves that there is a perceived pool of real names. Yes, there are some people who give their kids names completely of their own conception(like you said, as a result of the pool of names), but this is extremely rare. This does not have any serious impact however. As we have seen, there IS a perceived pool of real names, yet still people insist on choosing a name from this list, rather than creating one. ""Be that as it may, if parent's delve in a pool of preexisting names, it is only their fault for not having enough originality to think outside of the possibilities given to them."" And the statement I am arguing is that it is absurd of them to do so, and that it discourages individuality. You seem to agree with me here, saying that it is their ""fault"". Are you conceding then? ""There is no fake name and I agree with my opponent in that aspect. That being said, once a name is made, no matter how original or different it may be, becomes a real name and is therefore, added to the ""real names"" pool. Once the notion is put in the air ""I can name my son (josh, steven, harlan, eli, suzy) One takes that into consideration and then either applies it or uses it in a contrast against the names they want."" Yes, but how often are names being ""made""? The vast majority of society (and since the subject of this debate is society, we should focus on society) is only re-using names from the pool of real names. The common trend is not to enlarge the pool of names, but to pick from the names already there. The notion of having a pool of names in the first place is positively ridiculous. It is silly to choose a name held by millions of people not associated with your self. ""That is why last and middle names are rather useful"" Yes, your last name serves to provide family identity…but your first name is individual identity…or at least that's what it's supposed to be. If someone else has the same first name, you have that much less individual identity. ""in reality it isn't the name that defines the person, it's their actions and how they live their life."" Yes, this is true…but isn't it nice to have one word to mean all of that? In effect, you provide the definition of the name, which is a word for yourself, with your actions. The name summarizes all that. Your name is an identification, a title. ""Also, saying that allowing people to see what already exists in order to produce the opportunity to consider a name not already recorded is a splendid idea."" 1. that is much different than choosing a name from a pool of names. 2. You're right, it would be a splendid idea to say that, maybe you should say it. ""Jane did not know the name Steve existed therefore she was original."" Yes, I understand the hypothetical and see your point, but this scenario is probably very rare. ""My opponent did not explain how anyone is refusing a name."" Your right, I didn't…I never claimed such a thing…what's your point? My opponent has put too much stress on the term ""originality"", (and focused on the parents excessively) when I mentioned nothing originally about originality. This is not about the capacity of the parents or how original they were, or their merits in naming people, nor do I condemn the parents, but merely the societal trend of picking from a pool of ""real names"" rather than inventing one themselves. He has provided no advantages to this trend. He has admitted himself that it is a ""fault"" of the parents if they do not invent their own name, and thus agreeing with the topic he is supposed to be opposing. We have yet to see a logical reason as to why this system of picking from a pool of real names is advantageous or rational. And using your earlier mentioned name ""Steve"", I set out to find just how common this name is. According to http://www.namestatistics.com..., ""0.246% of males in the US are named Steve."" And ""around 301350 US males are named Steve"" This is not individualism. If you are named Steve, you are just one in 500 males in the US. Oh, it seems they have some sort of embedding thing at the bottom. What the hell, maybe it'll work: steve is the #74 most common male first name 0.246% of males in the US are named steve.

What is the difference between human friendship and the friendliness a loyal dog expresses to its owner? How is the panic a zebra feels when being chased different from our panic when we are in an extremely hard situation? How does a mother chimpanzee’s love for her daughter differentiate from that of human mothers to their children? When these animals will do all they can to keep their children alive, and we do the same thing, I cannot see the difference. You have again failed to give evidence that relates God to morality and merely given another groundless claim. “why not just kill off the old people since they are just taking up space and not putting any effort into society? Why do we love others so much?” I did not say that they are giving an effort NOW, I said, and I quote, “because we have evolved to survive on the planet and we know other animals did the same thing, and so there is a price on every life (an effort)”. You have straw-manned my argument to say that they are not doing an effort now, and so we should kill them, when I clearly said that they did an effort by evolving and fighting for their own lives, and this is what gives their lives value. This has nothing to do with the debate at hand anyway. Love is a good position to have with someone else, and I take a quote from Bertrand Russell’s “Why I Am Not A Christian”: “For this reason, love is better than hate, because it produces harmony instead of conflict between the wishes of said people. When there is love between two people, these win or lose together, but when they hate, the success of one is the failure of the other. “ You again use the “I don’t know, therefore God” logical fallacy with morality. Even if we did not know this, it does not mean God is real, because it hasn’t been proven He exists! “If there are none of these, life cannot exist. It would not just be a different form of life; life would NOT exist.” I have refuted this argument numerous times, and I will say it one last time: no one (no matter how intelligent they are) can tell you that life cannot arise in different conditions than those of this universe. This is simply because we have not found any other universes that have different physical laws, and we can not know that life could not arise in different conditions. This is yet another logical fallacy by the name of the black swan fallacy, which means that the one using the fallacy affirms something based on past experiences, rejecting different possibilities. http://www.conservapedia.com... As a matter of fact, we don’t even know what the first life form WAS, and we don’t know how exactly it originated, so it is not possible to make an accurate assessment about what can and cannot create life when we know so little. “We have other documents of these people not only in the Bible.” Name them and show reliability “Any historian scholar specializing in the life of Jesus can tell you who these people were and give you evidence of who they really were, using actual documents” Name this evidence and actual documents and show reliability. “We must have a certain amount of trust in these historical figures, or there will be no history whatsoever” Pro says we should trust certain historical figures or there will be no history, yet fails to give a criterion to choose which ones to believe in. Alexander the Great met and had contact with people we know and there are testimonies of people we know that can give accurate information on what he did and when he did it. There was even a city with his name at the time he conquered it! (Alexandria) “They were eyewitnesses of Jesus” We don’t know! I have been forced to repeat myself twice now: we don’t know who these men are, and whether or not they were even more than one person using several names. The Bible doesn’t even claim that Mark was an eyewitness, for example, and he does not appear to be one. Adding supposedly real quotes does not make a source reliable. The gospels are imperfect, they contradict each other, and are not reliable sources. Many examples are present such as contradictions in Jesus’ birthplace. Matthew claims that Joseph and Mary were living in Bethlehem when Jesus was born. Luke says they lived in Nazareth and were in Bethlehem for a census. http://www.biblicalcatholic.com...... The women reported the resurrection to others: Matthew 28:8 The women told no one about the resurrection: Mark 16: 8 (The bible) Only Matthew and Luke mention the virgin birth. http://infidels.org...... Many small, untrue statements are also mentioned, including Matthew 4: 8 8 Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. https://www.biblegateway.com...... Unless the world is flat, you cannot see all the countries or kingdoms of the world. The biggest mountain on Earth (Mount Everest) is not big enough to see half of the world, so this is a false story. Pro does not need to respond to every contradiction, these are merely used to point out that they are imperfect. Even if these were real men, it does not mean that what they say is real, for most of what they say is false or made-up. “Before Jesus died, he fulfilled prophecies of the Old Testament” There are millions of Jews (who follow the Old Testament) who will disagree and say that Jesus was not the Messiah, he was just a prophet. Jews believe the Messiah is yet to come. Isaiah is vague about who the man to come would be. He only mentioned the conditions in which it would happen, he did not make the incredibly small effort of mentioning the Messiah’s name. If anyone else follows the things written by Isaiah, he could technically be called the Messiah. Nostradamus, for example, wrote that a man in a blue robe will come to Europe from the Middle East and bring about great destruction. Any powerful enough Arab who reads this could meet the criterion, this does not mean that he was the man predicted to come or that the prophecy was real. “I cannot critique every single religion that is not Christianity. I don't know all of them, or I can't list all of them in here critiquing every single one. Please state one to promote instead of putting it in a vague term of ""other religions"" Pro has made no attempt to answer my question. I have not asked that he critique every religion, nor have I implied it, I have merely said that several religious believers will claim that their religion is the right one based on your arguments: the fine-tuning of the universe, the origin and complexity of life, morality… Once again I state that his argument merely points to missing information, and can be used to point to any character desired. I will put forth another example in case the point is not obvious: I am a Hindu, I rely on old texts to justify my beliefs, and I see things I can’t explain in the universe. I see the world around me and say: “What a marvel! Thank Brahma, for it must have been him who fine-tuned the universe, created life, and gave me my superior morality. And who can deny that Krishna existed, therefore Brahma is real!” I ask the reader to consider what the difference between my argument and Pro’s is. It seems that this is my last word, so I give my gratitude to Pro for accepting this debate. Thank you Pro, you provided me with an great experience to express my thoughts and argue with someone of a different opinion. For the readers of this debate, I hope that the voting that will take place afterwards will be fair and just, and not appeal either to me or Pro because his/her beliefs are the same to ours. I formally say goodbye."	CON	516
Sb22075a5-A14fff2ed	God is Real	"Pro began this debate with the assertion that ""God is real. Science proves it."" His argument seems to have been borrowed from this website: http://fernandoymas.blogspot.ca... My opponent began Round #2 with: German physicist Werner Heisenberg, a scientist by the way, concluded that quantum events cannot be predicted. He maintains that all freed electrons behave as if they are being influenced by an outside variable or force. This is the basis of his ""Uncertainty Principle"". I would like to ask you, what is that ""force""? Malcolm W. Browne discovered that there was a force that connected to two freed electrons and since energy is eternal, this force had to be and that it was also present in our time yet not involved with the flow of our time. Again I ask you, ""what is that force""? The website (see above) starts off like this: Werner Heisenberg came to the conclusion that quantum events can not be predicted. Uncertainty principlesstates all freed electrons behaves as if they are being influence by an outside variable of force. In signal travel and faster than light by Malcolm W. Browne, a force was found connecting two freed electrons was proved to be eternal--present within our time but not involve with the flow of our time. Thank you, Pro, for correcting the spelling mistakes. (Maybe you should have listed this website as a source.) Here's the problem: the arguments you found on this webpage are incoherent. The first argument is: ""Heisenberg's Uncertainty Princple, therefore God is eternal!"" Here's another one: ""The 1st Law of Thermodynamics, therefore God is all-powerful!"" Also: ""Double-slit experiment, therefore God is omniscient!"" These arguments don't make any sense. All in all, Pro's argument in favour of God can be summarized as: ""Science has unanswered questions, therefore God."" I have nothing more to say on this subject. Pro ended Round #5 with Pascal's Wager, which assumes that either ""Christianity is true"" or ""no religions are true."" That's a false dichotomy. Perhaps Islam is the one true religion. In that case, Christians will be punished in the afterlife. If you are somebody who chooses to have faith in God, to pray, to read the Bible, then I respect that and I am happy for you. Christianity is a healthy way to find spiritual fulfillment. That's what religious faith is all about. Religious faith is not about evidence, science, facts, proof, experiments, numbers, equations, laws, etc. Nobody listens to Jesus' Parable of the Sower and asks, ""Who was this farmer sowing the seeds? What year was it when the seeds were sown?"" These facts are not important. Jesus' underlying message is what counts. But we live in an age of science and reason. Too many Christians have become convinced that unless their religious faith passes the tests of science and reason, their faith is worthless. Religion and science have different roles. The rational, scientific answer to the question, ""Does the Christian God exist?"" is no."	CON	517
Sb22075a5-A60843ee	God is Real	"""Many theologians and theistic scientists claim that evidence has been found for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. However, they cannot deny that their evidence is not sufficiently convicing to satisfy the majority of scientists.""

(2) MY COMMENTS Science does not prove that God is real. So, it's no surprise that the majority of scientists do not believe in God. I have no idea which ""several experiments"" you're talking about that apparently prove the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, eternal force. I guess the majority of scientists haven't heard of these experiments either. Please elucidate. You argue that the law of conservation of energy is ""reason enough to believe in an un-created, indescructible eternal force."" I don't get it. To me, this argument seems irrational. Maybe I'm missing something. According to Wikipedia, the law of biogenesis ""is the observation that living things come only from other living things, by reproduction. That is, life does not arise from non-living material, which was the position held by spontaneous generation."" What does this have to do with God? God is not a living thing, made of living material, that reproduces. I can't imagine what you hope to prove about God with the first or second law of thermodynamics, or ""the Law of Like Forces Repelling.""

S694fa764-A5ce0f09b	Catholicism is Not Real Christianity	First off I would like to thank my opponent in advance for taking on this touchy subject. This is my first debate, but I ask that you do not go easy on me. I do not believe that Catholicism is a true form of Biblical Christianity. I will briefly give 5 reasons as to why I have this view without going into detail to allow my opponent to have the first real statement. 1. Catholicism prays to dead saints and worship idols. 2. Having priests, bishops, and a Pope is not Biblical or necessary. 3. The Catholic Church contradicts the Bible on many things. 4. Catholics worship Mary. 5. The Catholic Church has pagan roots and views.	PRO	519
S7908009f-A6928624b	God is Real, Evolution isn't	"Wait, how are you going to say we all die eventually, and we will find out when we get there. Get where? Does that mean you believe in another place when we die? Well, you should because it's called heaven. And you are right once the people who believed get to heaven we will find out. Belief in evolution is a remarkable phenomenon. It is a belief passionately defended by the scientific establishment, despite the lack of any observable scientific evidence(proof) for macroevolution (that is, evolution from one distinct kind of organism into another. These statements inadvertently show that evolution on any significant scale does not occur at present, and never happened in the past, and could never happen at all. If it were a real process, evolution should still be occurring, and there should be many ""transitional"" forms that we could observe. What we see instead, of course, is an array of distinct ""kinds"" of plants and animals with many varieties within each kind, but with very clear and -- apparently -- unbridgeable gaps between the kinds. That is, for example, there are many varieties of dogs and many varieties of cats, but no ""dats"" or ""cogs."" Lol. Such variation is often called microevolution, and these minor horizontal (or downward) changes occur fairly often, but such changes are not true ""vertical"" evolution. Evolutionary geneticists have often experimented on fruit flies and other rapidly reproducing species to induce mutational changes hoping they would lead to new and better species, but these have all failed to accomplish their goal. No truly new species has ever been produced, let alone a new ""basic kind. Evolution Never Happened in the Past: Evolutionists commonly answer the above criticism by claiming that evolution goes too slowly for us to see it happening today. They used to claim that the real evidence for evolution was in the fossil record of the past, but the fact is that the billions of known fossils do not include a single unequivocal transitional form with transitional structures in the process of evolving. Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion . . . it followed logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional forms leading from the less to the more evolved Even with DNA sequence data, we have no direct access to the processes of evolution, so objective reconstruction of the vanished past can be achieved only by creative imagination. Since there is no real scientific evidence that evolution is occurring at present or ever occurred in the past, it is reasonable to conclude that evolution is not a fact of science, as many claim, including you. Lol. Actually, these negative evidences against evolution are, at the same time, strong positive evidences for special creation. They are, in fact, specific predictions based on the creation model of origins. Evolution Is Religion -- Not Science In no way does the idea of particles-to-people evolution meet the long-accepted criteria of a scientific theory. There are no such evolutionary transitions that have ever been observed in the fossil record of the past; and the universal law of entropy seems to make it impossible on any significant scale. Evolutionists claim that evolution is a scientific fact, but they almost always lose scientific debates with creationist scientists. Accordingly, most evolutionists now decline opportunities for scientific debates, preferring instead to make unilateral attacks on creationists. Scientists should refuse formal debates because they do more harm than good, but scientists still need to counter the creationist message. The question is, just why do they need to counter the creationist message? Why are they so adamantly committed to anti-creationism? The fact is that evolutionists believe in evolution because they want to. It is their desire at all costs to explain the origin of everything without a Creator. Evolutionism is thus intrinsically an atheistic religion. Some may prefer to call it humanism, and ""new age"" evolutionists place it in the context of some form of pantheism, but they all amount to the same thing. Whether atheism or humanism (or even pantheism), the purpose is to eliminate a personal God from any active role in the origin of the universe and all its components, including man. Since both naturalism and humanism exclude God from science or any other active function in the creation or maintenance of life and the universe in general, it is very obvious that their position is nothing but atheism. And atheism, no less than theism, is a religion! Even doctrinaire-atheistic evolutionist Richard Dawkins admits that atheism cannot be proved to be true. Of course we can't prove that there isn't a God. Therefore, they must believe it, and that makes it a religion. Evolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science. Evolution is promulgated as an ideology, a secular religion -- a full-fledged alternative to Christianity, with meaning and morality . . . . Evolution is a religion. This was true of evolution in the beginning, and it is true of evolution still today https://i.pinimg.com..."	PRO	520

Sabfed07a-Aaefe764a	official catholic church teaching is that noncatholics and unbaptized infants go to hell	"I'll preface this by saying I went to Catholic school (though I am an atheist) and was taught that all Christians, Jews, Muslims and those who are ignorant of the Church, including kids who die before Baptism, go to Heaven. I like to play devil's advocate (and Catholic, harhar) whenever a theological question comes up, so this will be a fun exercise for me. I would like to state, before I do anything else, that my opponent must defend that official Church teaching is that all non-Catholics, including the unbaptized, go to hell. First I'd like to clarify what ""authoritative"" means in terms of Catholicism. The Pope may define doctrine of the Church when speaking ""ex cathedra"". The definition my opponent gave for authoritative basically is the exact same thing-- ...when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, (the Bishop of Rome) defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church. (wikipedia) The actual teaching authority is called, in Catholicism, ""magestirium"". The authority is vested in the Pope and the council of Bishops when in communion with him. A critical point of magestirium When the Pope calls a convention of Bishops and, working with them, defines church doctrine, that is as authoritative as the Pope speaking ex cathedra. Sources and definitions- http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.newadvent.org... So what has the Church said so far, authoritatively, about who gets past the great pearly gates? Well, as my opponent points out, the Cante Dominio (Papal Bull of Eugene IV, so it is ex cathedra and is therefore authoritative) clearly states that -- ""It firmly believes, professes, and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life, but will depart “into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels” [Matt. 25:41], unless before the end of life the same have been added to the flock; and that the unity of the ecclesiastical body is so strong that only to those remaining in it are the sacraments of the Church of benefit for salvation, and do fastings, almsgiving, and other functions of piety and exercises of Christian service produce eternal reward, and that no one, whatever almsgiving he has practiced, even if he has shed blood for the name of Christ, can be saved, unless he has remained in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church."" http://catholicism.org... --only Catholics go to heaven (I think my opponent could have picked better quotes!). Even if a man sheds his blood for Christ he may not be saved lest he remain ""in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church."" That was the deal in 1441, what have they said since? Well in 1964, some good ol' reform came to the Church. The Council was convened by the Pope and made in union with the council of Bishops, and has the same authority as the Cante Dominio (and since the Church is infallible, the Church follows Vatican 2 at this point). What did we hear from Vatican 2? ""The Catholic Church professes that it is the one, holy catholic and apostolic Church of Christ; this it does not and could not deny. But in its Constitution the Church now solemnly acknowledges that the Holy Ghost is truly active in the churches and communities separated from itself. To these other Christian Churches the Catholic Church is bound in many ways: through reverence for God's word in the Scriptures; through the fact of baptism; through other sacraments which they recognize."" 5. The non-Christian may not be blamed for his ignorance of Christ and his Church; salvation is open to him also, if he seeks God sincerely and if he follows the commands of his conscience, for through this means the Holy Ghost acts upon all men; this divine action is not confined within the limited boundaries of the visible Church."" And... ""The children who are born into these Communities and who grow up believing in Christ cannot be accused of the sin involved in the separation, and the Catholic Church embraces upon them as brothers, with respect and affection. For men who believe in Christ and have been truly baptized are in communion with the Catholic Church even though this communion is imperfect. ...it remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church."" ""The brethren divided from us also use many liturgical actions of the Christian religion. These most certainly can truly engender a life of grace in ways that vary according to the condition of each Church or Community. These liturgical actions must be regarded as capable of giving access to the community of salvation."" http://www.religioustolerance.org... In plain English Vatican 2 states that those who are ignorant may be saved and that those who are non-Catholic Christians may be saved as well. Whether or not, this was a ""political statement"" as my opponent conjectures, it is undeniably authoritative Church teaching. It is official Church doctrine and states, explicitly, that non-Catholics and even non-Christians may be saved! On the condition of ignorance, non-Christians may be saved! How awesome is that? I could make a much larger case in defense of the point Vatican 2 may include Muslims and Jews among those who are saved as well, but I think the point stands that, according to the Catholic Church today, anyone who is ignorant of the Church (including those who know of and do not understand it) can be saved if they act as God wishes. I am not sure how much of a case I can make specifically for children who are yet to be baptised without making a counter argument. I researched and found the Vatican website's paper on the Church's position on pre-Baptismal death. My opponent may read it himself, as may the viewers. I will point out that even before Vatican 2 unofficial Church teaching was that Limbo was where unborn and unbaptized infants went; since they had done no wrong but had not been cleansed of original sin they could not be damned to Hell nor admitted to Heaven. The Church ostensibly has no official position on infant death; I see no evidence to support they would be damned to hell. I will leave that to pro to prove more fully. http://www.vatican.va... TL,DR- I think I have made a strong case that non-Catholics may be saved (which is authortative Church teaching) and I will leave it to Pro to really prove that infants go to Hell as the Church does not have a strong position on the issue. In any case I look forward to the rest of this debate."	CON	525

He created the universe and even time. And the thing is, God may have said ""eternal"" in his perspective because He's the one who created everything. Continuing on, we know that God will never die because He's a perfect being. So this could literally conclude that eternal must mean forever. (However, the only way to eternal to die is if God dies. But God would never die, so basically we could see that eternal literally means forever.) "" This statement has no proof backing it up... It is merely your opinion.. I did think about it... But that would be useless.. I didn't think about it, I researched it and proved you wrong and me right.. :) OK so... The original bible was written in Hebrew, Then translated to Greek.... then all these languages now.... In Hebrew there is actually no word for ""Forever"" there is literally no word for it.... The word actually used was ""olam"" which basically describes a long duration of time.. With an unknown length (http://jewishroots.net...) (that is a Jewish website explaining the word) that word was translated to to the Greek word ""aion"" which means a life, or a lifespan... ""It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word P01; ^5;O84;a4;_7; (ho aion), from the archaic ^5;O84;b9;a4;_7; (aiwon). In Homer it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the Sanskrit word kalpa and Hebrew word olam."" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org...)

Once this time is over there will be nothing left of you... Please prove me wrong on this point You keep saying Im contradicting my argument.... I am not... I am saying it is eternal because you are destroyed... No coming back from it... Eternally not existing... Not existing in itself is a punishment...

Se601a988-A60031a42	If Solipsism is believed to be real and true, then theism must also be true and real.	(Apologies if I'm wrong, but I'm working under the assumption that R2 is for arguments and R3 is for rebuttals.) If Solipsism is believed to be real and true, then theism must also be true and real. I negate. My objection to this argument comes from one main contention: There is no necessary link between creation and Theism What we perceive as godliness and being a god are two separate things. For example, if a scientist were to go back in time and show an ancient human modern science, he may be branded a deity. This, however does not make the scientist a deity. He would have to meet the qualifications for such a claim. Over the millennia, certain qualifications have been made by seeing all of man’s mythology come together, these qualifications are: Control over some aspect of, or all of reality. Immortality. The inability to be harmed by mortals. Omnipresence, omniscience, and/or omnipotence Is supernatural in nature All gods, from almost all cultures, meet, to varying degrees, most or all of those qualifications. If solipsism is true, then the solipsist, as far as he/she can verify, only meets one, and even that to an unimpressive degree (as the solipsist is unable to actively control the universe). Just because one is a creator, doesn’t mean one is a god. Once again I return to the scientist analogy. Let’s say that the scientist was able to create another universe. If they were unable to control the universe at will, still able to be killed in that universe, were able to be harmed by anyone, couldn’t know everything going on, and wasn’t supernatural, it hardly seems fit to call them a god, thus making theism accurate for said universe. We then see in turn that the solipsist is unable to control the universe at will, able to be killed in the universe, able to be harmed by anyone, can’t know everything going on, and isn’t supernatural. This last problem deserves its own sub-contention. The Problem with the supernatural The issue with theism in general is that it rests on the supernatural. I quote James Orr, “If God is a reality, the whole universe rests on a supernatural basis. A supernatural presence pervades it; a supernatural presence sustains it.” https://books.google.com... This sense of “supernatural” is the issue. It’s a vague term that generally means outside of nature. The trouble with this is that if the world did not actually exist and the only thing that did exist was the solipsist, then the solipsist would be the only natural entity. The solipsist would not be not supernatural. But the only natural entity. I hope you enjoyed my arguments, I await yours. The Blue Arcanist	CON	529
S7908009f-A5675e74f	God is Real, Evolution isn't	"The Evolution Theory is called that, well, because it is a theory. It has been proven wrong. Evolution was developed before science had the evidence ability to prove the theory was false. No new scientific discoveries have been found to support the Theory of Evolution. An example: A wingless bird began to evolve a wing. Why does this happen, evolutionists mouths are shut. The wing stub of a bird did not make a bird more adaptable to his environment. The first wing stub would be too small for the bird to fly. This is where it hurts the theory of natural selection, which states that birds adapt and change in order to survive better in their habitat. The bird with a half-sized wing is placed at a disadvantage in its environment. Another theory is that evolutionists say that birds grew hollow bones to make flight less heavier. That is impossible. A bird can""t just decide to grow their bones hollow. That""s like humans saying ""Hey, my feet hurt tell my brain to fly"". Your brain cannot evolve flight. Also, if evolution was real wouldn""t we be able to evolve wings to survive in our environment? I mean, we went from a monkey to human, right? Think about it. It""s not possible. If a human evolve wings, than you have to tell me, that would be a world record or a great wonder. If evolution were true, all plants, animals, and insects would be in a continual state of change. Meaning no two creatures or human would be identical. Another questions I would like to throw in is : How did life learn how to reproduce itself? Once again, the mouths of evolutionists"" are shut. Which evolved first: blood, the heart,or the blood vessels for the blood to travel through? I mean, evolution had to start with only one of these, right? According to evolution we had to evolve to survive ,and I am pretty sure you can""t live without a heart. But if the heart doesn""t have any blood, the heart wouldn""t be able to pump; so how did we come to be? Finally, it""s time to tell you about creation, the true creation of the earth, galaxies, and everything within it. In the beginning,God created the heavens and the earth. He is the Alpha and Omega, beginning and the end. He is why evolutionists can try to back up there theory and say to meteors collided and made the Big Bang. It""s true God made the stars and meteors but the Big Bang did not happen. It all started with God saying what He wanted and it becoming that. One example that God created us is ,well, us. All of are organs were created at once, which means evolvement could not have happen. There is also a benefit in the Christian creation. In the Christian creation, you know you were meant to be part of a world full of wonders and that someone loves you decided that they want you to live on earth and eternal life in heaven. In the Evolution Theory, you are taught that you were a mistake and will soon just die. I don""t know about you, but I refuse to believe that I was a mistake."	PRO	530
Sfd336fc2-A4409c650	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	That is madness. If you think you are God, suffering from amnesia, trying to find himself, then you are spiritually deluded. I noticed also your denial that God created the universe, I guess that shuts down the discussion. So you think God put his consciousness into a universe he didn't create? So the universe happened all by itself? Just like that? Well, maybe hell happened just like that too...have a great day.	CON	531

People should eat briefly floored food items more often. Voting Suggestions: CONDUCT: Pro (me), due to forfeitures. S&G (spelling and grammar): Tied. While it leans in my favor, not by enough to claim the point (everything but argument should be by a noteworthy margin, such as things which distracted from the argument someone made). ARGUMENTS: Pro, no contest. SOURCES: Pro, as my sources were on topic and presented a strong case in favor of my side. Further none of my sources were challenged, and I ruthlessly shot down all of con’s.	PRO	532
S1cce27af-A8f1c631a	The God of classical theism is real.	"In all likelihood, the God of classical theism (i.e. an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God) does not exist. The belief in such a being is, more importantly, primarily sustained through nothing more than a strange juxtaposition of terrible evidence melded with shoddy reasoning. In the course of this debate I will demonstrate that: 1. The presence of gratuitous evil makes the existence of a benevolent God unlikely. 2. The occurrence of reasonable unbelief in a theistic God makes the existence of such a being implausible. 3. God almost certainly does not exist because God would have to be a being of extremely improbable ordered complexity. =====> Why I Am Not A Christian <====== Contention 1: The Evidential Argument From Evil The occurrence of gratuitous evil, though logically compatible with God's existence, makes the existence of a benevolent God rather unlikely. For the sake of argument, I will concede that there is no a priori negation of God's existence by the presence of evil. Nonetheless, the problem of evil is much better viewed as an inductive rather than a deductive argument. As such, the pertinent question at hand is not: ""Is the existence of God logically compatible with the existence of evil?"" The real question before us, brothers and sisters, should be: ""Given that there is all this needless suffering, what are the odds that there is a God that takes a special interest in human affairs?"" In light of this supposition, the occurrence of evil renders the existence of God quite doubtful. Moreover, God's existence becomes less and less plausible when one takes into account all of the needless suffering that is visited upon this Earth on a daily basis. Consider, for example, the natural evils that are rampant in the world. In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed over 500,000,000 people, many of them children. [1] Likewise, in the course of Earth's history over 99.9% of all the species that have ever lived have gone extinct. [2] Do these facts suggest that there is an omnibenevolent God that takes a special interest in life on Earth? Not at all: in truth, that is probably the last thing that should be inferred from such facts. None of this capriciousness, indifference, and cruelty makes any sense under the premise that there is a loving God that cares about humanity. All of this evidence is, however, sensible under the assumption that no such being exists. Therefore, reasonable people should employ Ockham's razor to dispose of the God hypothesis since it fits rather poorly with the occurrence of gratuitous and pervasive evil. Contention 2: The Argument From Divine Hiddenness If God wanted humanity to know that he existed, as many theists often propose, then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him. As such, if God existed and God wanted us to know this, then reasonable non-belief should not occur. But reasonable non-belief does occur because God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, if he does exist. This, it would seem, entails a contradiction. The philosopher Theodore Drange sets forth a formal version of the argument in the following syllogism: 1. If God exists, God: (a) wants all humans to believe God exists before they die; (b) can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die; (c) does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and (d) always acts in accordance with what it most wants. 2. If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die. (From 1) 3. But not all humans believe God exists before they die. .: Therefore, God does not exist. (From 2 and 3) (Drange [3]) As can be plainly seen, the presence of reasonable unbelief presents a very real problem for the existence of God. The common religious response to this argument usually alludes to the notion that the ways of God are mysterious. However, this proposition flies in the face of the central doctrines surrounding theism. According to theism, God wants humans to have a relationship with him. Meanwhile, this God has also cloaked himself from the greatest tools and insights of modern science. Surely, any God that would bother to involve himself in the affairs of one primate species in a universe teeming with over 70 sextillion stars is not as inscrutable as all that. [4] If, however, the argument from divine hiddenness is removed from its deductive form, then there are still serious problems that occur for the theist. For instance, intelligence and educational attainment run along a negative correlation with religious belief. [5] It would therefore not be untrue to say that if God existed, then God has set up a salvation scheme whereby the mentally unbalanced and poorly educated are those statistically most likely to accept the truth of that revelation. On the other hand, 93% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences may be doomed for an eternity by their skeptical doubts. [6] Does this not strike you as odd, dear Christian? Furthermore, other problems for religion arise if theism is sought to be reconciled with the rest of reality. If a theistic God exists, then that God: 1. set in motion a process of biological creation-- evolution via natural selection --which needs no guidance. [7] 2. created a universe through readily understandable physical laws. [8] 3. remains totally and utterly hidden from human perception. In other words, if God existed then that God designed and maintains the universe in such a way so as to make it appear as if he didn't exist. Needless to say, the plausibility that God exists and is simultaneously a trickster seems very low by any objective standard available. Contention 3: The Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit If the traditional argument from design is followed to its logical end, then it leads to a self-defeating conclusion. Esteemed evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins, presents this as one of his main arguments in his book, The God Delusion, and he calls it The Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit. [9] The thrust of the argument goes something like this: Statistical improbability in cosmology (it is argued) must be accounted for by an explanation. In most religious circles the usual explanation is referred to as God or an ‘intelligent designer'. God, in this setting, is viewed as being the terminus for the problem of complexity. However, the God hypothesis only regresses the problem and does nothing to actually solve it. Any God capable of designing the universe would necessarily have to be enormously complex and thus more improbable than the universe itself. Simply put, you can't explain away statistical improbability by postulating an explanation that is even more improbable than that which is trying to be explained. Evolution via natural selection is the only system we know of that can create complexity out of simplicity. Unfortunately, we do not possess a similarly powerful theory in physics to explain complexity, but the relatively weak theories we do have are of magnitudes better than the question begging God hypothesis. However improbable or ‘finely tuned' the universe may be, a God that could design or ‘fine tune' the universe would have to be even more complex and improbable than the universe itself. Ergo, God almost certainly does not exist. ::Conclusion:: If the foundations of my arguments are accepted, then the God hypothesis is untenable. And in the absence of any convincing arguments for God's existence the only reasonable position a person can take is unbelief. Nevertheless, I am more than open to the possibility that I may be wrong. If you have detected any errors in my reasoning please fell free to let me know. You may yet still have time to save me from the torments of hell. ::References + Definitions:: http://www.debate.org..."	CON	533
S30b19de3-A5aca353f	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	"This is going to look like nit picking but I promise it's not, I'll go back to your other points. ""you can't take the Bible literally."" What does that mean? This book is supposed to be God's word, the outline for an entire religion. But it's okay to only believe some of it? That's not how it works, either you believe it all or none. If you can believe that hell isn't a literal place what else isn't true? Was Adam not made of dirt? Was the Earth not created in 6 days? Did the Earth not flood for 40 days and 40 nights? Did the Hebrews not cross the desert? Did Jesus not die and then rise from the dead? If you classify one part of the bible being less true than the others you invalidate the accuracy of the book as a whole. The bible is an infallible text, to take away that infallibility makes it no more true than Harry Potter. As for your God can be loving but hell can exist argument. A father letting his son be poor, and subjecting someone to eternal torture and fire. Are two completely different things. Especially when the son caused his own troubles, what about the 5 billion people who don't believe in the Christian God. Are they all going to hell because by no fault of their own they were raised to follow a different God? The analogy is not perfect. If you believe God is all powerful than yes he can just beam them to the high life. When you forgive someone you don't cast them out so they spend the rest of time existing in Agony, for some mistakes they made in the short time that was their life. The existence of God is no more possible than the existence of flying unicorns, I saw that argument yesterday. Even if the existence of such a creature is less than 1-100,000,000,000,000,000 no matter how many zero's you put after that it could still exist. That is not a good argument. There is nothing reasonable about it. Quantum Mechanics required the theory of relativity which involves math and other theories. The only proof we have for the existence of God is an ancient book written by men who thought the earth was flat, the heart controlled emotion, and that the weather cycle was dependent on animal sacrifice. How could these men possibly have any knowledge of the supernatural or the origin of our existence? There is plenty evidence against the existence of God. Firstly the bible says the Earth and the rest of existence was created in 6 days roughly 7000 years ago. Obviously that is not true, we find rocks that are hundreds of millions years old. We find human bones that are over 100,000 thousand years old. This is the core concept of Christianity, that the Earth was created by God at this time in that time period. Without this the chances of him existing start to fall apart. Homosexuality, I'm a straight married man. I have nothing against gays. It doesn't make it impossible, but again it lowers the chances of his existence. If God did hate homosexuals, then there is another problem with the logic of God. If you hate something why create it? If it's not natural why does it exist in all parts of nature. Surely if homosexuality was against His will he would never allow such indiscretion to occur in His natural kingdom. There is no faith in Science. Faith requires belief in the lack of evidence. There is absolutely no faith involved in Science. If there was it would no longer be science, because it would be devoid of evidence. Your argument makes no sense. By believing something that provides me with evidence, instead of something that does not I am a hypocrite? I am not blindly believing in Science, I require facts, evidence, statistics to form my opinions. I understand religion just as well if not better than you do. There are no misconceptions about the bible, it says what it says. And the Church agrees that the bible is infallible. Now here's something. God is supposed to be Pure and Good. Free will, God gives everyone free will right? Say a woman and her son are walking down the street and a rapist and a murderer attack them. Since God is everywhere he sees this. Someone's free will is going to have to be violated, and there is a choice between violating the murderers and rapists free will or the will of the mother and child. But instead of stopping rapes or murderers God lets them happen. No Good being would allow rape or murder to happen when there are other alternatives. If that was too complicated here is some simple logic. God is omniscient and knows everything, including everything that has happened and will happen, as well as every thought your mind creates before you think it. If that's the case, there is no ""free will."" So that's one pillar of Christianity. God is omnipotent, and can do anything. If God can do anything but doesn't lift a finger to stop all the disasters, massacres and wars that have happened, are happening now and will happen in the future, God is a psychopath who enjoys watching our misery. There goes the pure and good. However, if the God is not omniscient or omnipotent... well, in that case God is not a ""god"" and doesn't exist. I look forward to your refutation, and I think you're being pretty civil with this whole debate thing, and I appreciate that."	PRO	534
S9958d011-A3b94dc9c	Christianity is not real.	"If possible would it be more comfortable, if Con could actually make in-text-references for his sources, because after checking them I noticed a fair amount of copy&paste material; especially the first argument. Round 2 Structure [Rebuttal 1] General problems with comparing Jesus to other religious authorities 1a: The case Horus 1b: The case Krishna 1c: The case Buddha [Argument 1] Evidence for Jesus the historical person Note: I'll continue these arguments next round, when I don't run out of characters [R1] General problems with comparing Jesus to other religious authorities I respect my opponents concept of comparing Jesus to others but I see some grave problems in this technique, if the intention is to show, that Jesus is made up. On first though, Jesus doesn't necessary need to be made up, just because there are stories about him that are. Jesus doesn't even loose his status as the messiah, just because some of his doings might or might not have happened. Mark for example never wrote about Jesus birth yet his gospel is included in the bible and he was obviously convinced that what he wrote was enough to show Jesus as the saviour. We can't even be sure how much the gospel writers plagiarised from other religions to show that Jesus was the saviour. Some links can easily be meant as metaphors (such as the virgin birth) while others rather can't (such as the healing). The bible is a complex piece of writing. Most of it's parts were written (long) after Jesus died, in many different languages that are not spoken any more (e.g. traditional Greek) and the whole thing has been edited by each subculture of Christianity many times (I am talking for example about the Vatican Councils), meaning that the bible is not even reliable in terms of representing their original sources properly. My opponent yielded to the temptation of arguing that the bible is either true or false. And if it is false, it must be made up. And if it is made up, Jesus must be made up. But this logic has its problems. The real question is: do we have reason to believe that there was person (ideally named Jesus) that served as the role model that inspired the creation of Christianity? (see Argumentation below) 1a: The case Horus Anyway, I'll take the time to show why the given comparisons are even weak if we ignore that they can't show what Pro is trying to. With Horus we have a similar problem as we have with Jesus: that the stories about him developed and changed a lot and are only partly reliable. Different subcultures praised different forms and back stories of Horus, in one he, for example, is the son of Ra. Just as Osiris (another father) is a male god but still the father. AncientEgyptOnline already lists seven different types of Horus-cults of which the average Horus isn't much Jesus like {1b} but in case of Horus, the child of Osiris and Isis, his conception is most similar to what we find in Christianity, especially as Art later represented Jesus and Mary similar to Horus and Isis {1c}. This tells us, that people have later tried a lot to create and show similarities as a method of communication. We have to understand that people could not always read or had a very limited knowledge. Links like this are methods just as rhetoric to underline a message; plagiarism used to be good style. We might even consider Jesus to underline the parallels. If we assume that the people at his time knew about Horus so did he. Similarities can be intentionally. Just considering the number of disciples: twelve as it seems to be but the crowd around Jesus might have been bigger {2} meaning that the choice to mention mainly the twelve most trusted was also choice of those who told the stories. A good example is the translation of Lazarus and Asar. I strongly believe neither one of them was actually named that way. These names are often assigned to serve the purpose of the story: Lazarus is the Hebrew version of Eleazar, meaning ""God"" and ""support"" or ""help"" {3}. 1b: The case Krishna I don't want to say much on Krishna, especially because I don't want just repeat points from 1a. But the links to Krishna are really not substantial. A barn and a prison have nothing in common. To have children nice and smooth at the hospital is certainly a modern day thing. The survived-death-thing and the temptation-thing is what we also find with Horus. Did Krishna plagiarised the Egypts, too? And in terms of the sharp objects: Before guns were developed you only had three options to kill someone if you weren't willing to wait till they die of natural causes: hard objects, poison and sharp objects. And stabbing has a different poetry than hitting Krishna and Jesus with a stone. Anyway, to draw a line between being crucified (a punishment) and shot with an arrow (a war and anger act) is pretty far-fetched for everything before the 15th century. 1c: The case Buddha Here we have a nice example that great ideas and morals can develop apart from each other and still focus on the same points. The given examples sound similar, but we have to consider, that they are both translations into English from two languages that have not the same origin as English. Which is by the way a nice example because written languages are a very similar form of communication yet developed partly unknowing about how other cultures communicated. An interview with the sutta translator Bhikkhu Bodhi shows for example how translations sometimes sacrifice content to have a nice rhetoric construct; ""This problem becomes all the more acute when one is translating from an ancient language utilizing a somewhat archaic set of conceptual metaphors into a modern language pertaining to a very different culture"" (Bhikku Bodhi; Interview) {4}. This explains why Buddhas teaching and Jesus teaching sound so similar. The same morals have been translated by using similar words. Or to say it differently: Two authentic ideas can still be paraphrased similar. [A1] Evidence for Jesus, the historical Person There is documentary evidence for Jesus life, or at least his death, from different sources, that are not the bible such as Tacitus the Roman historian (55 - 115. A.D.) and Flavius Josephus (~ 37 - 101 A.D) a Jewish priest. Josephus, in the Arabic version of his writing {5}: ""At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. And his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. And those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them after his crucifixion and that he was alive; accordingly, he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders."" (Josephus) And Tacitus, who hated both Jews and Christians and had therefore even less reason to foster any believe in Jesus reported: ""Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate [...]"" (Tacitus) {6} Even the Talmud mentions Jesus {6} and though this is another religious (yet not Christian) source, there seems to be no reason for Judaism to mention Jesus if there was not reason to believe that he, as a person, was real; as his whole existence challenges core points of Jewish believes.

Your trap is indeed wonderful, I acknowledge thee as a creative and wonderful opponent. As thou gazes upon my glorious, divine argument, I ask of thee, ""Who is the ultimate puppeteer? The one that makes the puppet think he's the puppeteer?"" O great and divine Santa, gtfo. You have complete fallen into my trap. I had been waiting for you to post this argument, the final argument, stated this way. Now, as you said, playtime is finished. It is time to annihilate you and win this argument. Time and time again, thou hath failed to grasp thy meaning of this Debate Thou hath decimated thyself, and thou is digging his own grave. Thou hath indeed created a character identical to God, the God that I believe in. In thy context of thou's argument, Santa is only similar to God. I hath pointed out Santa's flaws in that context, simply assuming Santa is omnipotent and omniscient, and hath 10 commandments, and hath a book called Babble. I hath criticised Santa's logic. I hath criticised Santa's power, although he has none. I hath criticised Santa himself. In Reality, I hath not criticised God himself. I hath only perhaps criticised him in thou's context. Thy character of Santa is not exactly the same as God, as he is crafted by claims, of which hath no evidence. I indeed believe naught in Santa, as I hath stated, Santa has insufficient evidence. Santa is not the same as God, only same in thou's context which has no evidence, and is totally made out of claims. I hath only debated as an Atheist under thou's context. Thou hath created an unrealistic context, which is completely based on claims and a lack of evidence. That is exactly what I hath tried to point out. All my other arguments criticising Santa, is based on the foundation that thou's context does not hath enough evidence. Thee hath assumed that just because he crafted Santa as God, I hath insulted God. No, I hath naught insulted God, as your context hath not enough evidence. I hath rebutted this in my last round, and hath included that thee's context hath not enough evidence. Thee's logic is flawed, he hath created Santa out of claims. Only therein the flawed thinking of thee, is Santa real. I hath stated this continuously throughout my argument, it is my main argument, one of my foundations. I could easily claim that thou is a camel. But thee is not a camel. I however, keep insisting that thee is a camel, without proper evidence to back my statement up. This is how thou sounds. There is naught the same amount of Evidence for God and Santa. I hath provided extreme rebuttals for this, yet thou do not grasp my rebuttals completely. Thou hath not rebutted my rebuttals for how Santa lacks evidence. Santa's sole evidence is about the Babble, imaginary 10 commandments. However, Santa does not hath these. Thou argument about how I Santa is the same as God is flawed, especially as Santa has not enough evidence. (Claims do naught count as evidence) Thou couldn't even rebut my rebuttals about God having more evidence than Santa. No, thou hath keep insisting that Santa has sufficient amount of evidence, the same as God. Thy flaws that cover God's flaws, does not cover Santa's, as Santa does not have enough evidence. God hath real evidence indeed, in the real world, while Santa's hath only claims as evidence, claims made by thou. Now, I shall summarise the Debate, to show that I am the ultimate puppeteer, and Pro my puppet. First, I predicted this outcome, and Con thought that he had ""lured"" me into this Debate. All my fear, about how I was scared about Con's final argument, is all faked. Secondly, Con's thinking is flawed. He literally gave Santa these powers, that are similar to God. However, we are debating about Reality here, not some Child's flawed thinking. You can't give Santa these powers. He needs to have proper evidence of these powers. Thirdly, the same criticism that I used cannot be used against God, especially as Santa needs to have proper evidence of these powers in the first place. The powers cannot be simply made up by you. If that was the case, there would be no such thing as Religion. Sorry to inform you about this, but in a Debate, EVIDENCE is the fundamental requirement to winning a Debate. Your argument had NO evidence. And I mean almost literally none. Here are the errors you made. ~Get shrekt~ Rebuttal Type 1 I provided scientific evidence as to why God is real, yet you do not. Santa does not have scientific evidence, only evidence made out of claims which needs more evidence. I have been emphasizing this throughout my Debate. This is ironic, as this Link should be used against Con instead. The bias is false. This Rebuttal against me is clearly based on the assumption that Santa can be given powers (by you) similar to God. Rebuttal Type 2 Pro has yet made another blunder. If popularity cannot be used as a piece of evidence, then surely imagination cannot be used too. Rebuttal Type 2 I find this ironic, as you have pointed out the flaw in your argument. ""CON does not understand that these arguments were not real, and instead they were to mimic the way a christian would debate."" I am the puppeteer, you are the puppet. I know everything about you. I already knew from the start that these arguments were not real. Time for Rebuttals 1. God sometimes ignore us, as we are sinful. God will not abide with our Sin. 2. Wish lists are for parents to know what their kids want, so they can rush down to the toy shop when their kids are sleeping. 3. I have already rebutted this. God should not need to answer 100% of time. God cannot stand Sin, and we are Sinful. Only the purest of the purest can speak to God, and even then they are not complete pure. 4. God has proved himself more than an old book. God is an arbiter, our definition of Sin does not apply to him, and never will. I have already stated this. God has proved himself more by just a Bible. Are you blind? Read my arguments. 5. We destroyed our good life, abusing our Free Will. God gave us good life. I have already stated this. Read my arguments. 6. I have fking rebutted this in my last argument. God provided oppotunities for Sin, so that Adam and Eve would be tempted. Adam and Eve were spoiled, they only knew perfectness, because of the idyllic world God gave them. God took a gamble, and put that tree smack in the middle of the Garden. The thing is, you need to experience bad health to know what good health is. I have already said that God is the balancer, he balances everything. Which is why he is fair. He creates the good, he creates the bad. He kills, he revives. A threat from God will contradict his nature, as God gave us Free Will. Threatening will be compromising it, and God does not do anything contradictory to his nature. 7. Lmfao, your argument is flawed. You are arguing as an Atheist. I could say that the other way round. BoP is on you, btw. So you've to prove it. I rebutted this in the comments. 8. You are stupid. Arguing that Santa and God is imaginary is against your position. You are not arguing as an arbiter or as an Atheist, your position is arguing as a believer of Santa. This contradicts his position. I urge Voters to look carefully. I am the ultimate manipulator. You have been fooled, tricked into believing you are the master. Summary: Pro's rebuttals can be rebutted by his rebuttals. Pro has yet to rebut some of my rebuttals. He has provided weak rebuttals for all of them. His argument, the final one contradicts his position. He has not read through my arguments carefully, and he has provided weak rebuttals that have already been rebutted by me. All his rebuttals are based on the assumption that you can create a Character and give him powers. No, the Character needs to have the power by himself, and he requires proof too. Evidence is everything in Debating. Pro obviously does not know this. He has again and again provided rebuttals that are already rebutted. Link https://scholar.google.com.sg... Summary: Pro loses.

Pro has done many things in his first round. He has: a) Shown poor conduct : ""dumb idiot"" b) Shown poor spelling: ""yea right"" c) Shown that he is too self confident: ""argue against my wit and intelligence."" The R1 argument provided no evidence as to why I should believe their false claims. It is extremely unlikely that we are living in an experiment created by the Government. If we were that weak and inferior in comparison to the government then what would be the point of an election and all of the election campaigns. Also it would have to be a pretty big test chamber to contain us (an Earth sized one) I have been to England, Wales, Spain, USA, Portugal, Australia, Thailand, New Zealand and France. Others have been there too. There are countless examples of people going in other countries so you cannot deny that the world is small and there is no evidence that there is more than 1 country.

Here are my R2 rebuttals: My opponent claims that the key word is thought and therefore my theory is wrong however my opponent's theory is not even thought to be true. My theory is more plausible as well as likely since the most commonly used theory is the one presented by me. My opponent has not provided a source of anyone else genuinely believing his theory and he has not told me why his theory is right with any evidence unlike my arguments that were backed up with sources and evidence. My opponent states that this theory is come up by scientists to make them look smart. I'm almost certain that if there was a giant projector projecting a hologram of the moon then tell me why nobody has discovered this projector. It would be clear which direction the projection would coming from. You are asking me how the hell that I know that it isn't made up but really since the BoP is completely on my opponent I should be asking my opponent the same question. My opponent further claims that I can only win this if I can say that I have been to the moon and physically been on it yourself. Okay, so all I need to do is say that ... okay then is everyone reading this: I have been to the moon and physically been on it myself. There you go. I win this debate - only joking, but seriously you can only make that claim if you have tried to go to the moon and seen that there is not moon. Your logic works both ways and since the BoP is on you it your own logic harms your argument more than it harms mine."	CON	545

Sf851a9d8-A901e1636	Numbers Are Not Real but Quatities Are.	Numbers 0, 1, 2, …, 9 are actually called digits and I agree with you they are simply symbols in a man-made decimal system that conveniently uses the fact that man has 10 fingers to count with. Quantities on the other hand, are as real as you are 1 person and with your mum and dad are 3 people. The solar year has approximately 365 days which is a natural quantity and not man-made becuase earth revolution around the sun involves 365 earth spins. NOW prime numbers are very very very special, as special as the atoms in chemistry are. They are the basic building blocks for all other non-prime (composite) numbers. For example the quantity18 = 2^1 * 3^3 while the quantity 19 is only divisible by itself and 1 (the unit) so 19 a prime or a building block for other numbers.

S3a7cba7f-A56a03d28	Evolution is real.	"""why do humans and chimps look the same?"" you say ""Evolution"" but provide no evidence to back this claim up. I say we look similar because we are made by the same designer. I know some people that look more like cats than monkeys and some people that look like a lizard. This doesn't mean they mutated from a cat or a lizard to become human. - ""birds have different beaks"" This is merely variation not vertical evolution. like people having different colour eyes or hair. The common ancestor of the birds is a BIRD. ""goose bumps?"" God designed creatures to get goose bumps. I just do not see in any way how you have provided ANY good evidence for evolution or even a half decent logical argument. You conceded the fossil argument by not refuting my claim that there are NO transitional fossils. You failed to provide even a single example. Your entire argument is basically ""Why do we humans and chimpanzees look the same? Evolution. Our features are similar to theirs."" - No evidence, bold assertion. I say we look the same because we have the same Designer, God. This is a far more rational and logical explanation than ""first there was nothing, then there was dirt, then there was soup, molecules, millions upon millions of beneficial mutations (of which not one has EVER been observed), and then Man. You fail to see the complexity, power, knowledge and beauty of Man as the handy work of a loving, all powerful, perfect Father who is in heaven. The bible says this in John John 1 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. 16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. CONCLUSION - I have provided 6 definitions of evolution in round 3 ALL of which remain un-refuted - My opponent dropped the fossil record argument. - My opponent failed to provide even a single scientifically sourced piece of evidence for evolution. - I showed how evolution was mathematically impossible in the second round. My opponent ignored this completely. Actually, now that I have looked over this debate it is clear that there is no way my opponent has ""proven"" that ""Evolution is real"" as is the title states.

S30b19de3-Af41410b3	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	"No one is saying there isn't good in the bible. Not murdering or stealing is good. But not if it is followed up with so much hypocrisy it invalidates the message. Hitler banned animal testing, enforced welfare, and was anti-tobacco. That doesn't make him not Hitler. Hitler still killed millions of innocent men, women and children. Just because something like the bible or someone like Hitler has some good points, that doesn't outweigh all the other horrible things that person or thing caused. As for how true the bible is.... If we can see that major parts of the text are incorrect who is to say the entire text isn't equally flawed. Maxwells' theory may have been incorrect, but that's okay. It was a theory. The bible is not supposed to be a theory, but an infallible text. Something that is perfect. Theory's are never perfect and usually change overtime as science advances. It's seems you misunderstand the bible. God doesn't care if you don't know him, John 14:6 Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" That is pretty bluntly saying Jesus is the only way into Heaven. And most Theists believe that god is Trinitarian (trinity, three parts) God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Even if the description of hell is an analogy, why would that make a difference if that's how it would feel to us? If it is so bad that it reminds us of torture and fire, it might as well be full of torture and fire. If God could just beam them up, then he wouldn't have sent them to hell in the first place. No it is not elegant to learn, if it involves us suffering in agony just to learn a lesson. How does repentance make sense if God let Jesus be tortured and then killed, for all our sins. We've already been forgiven apparently. You want where I got my verses for my claims? Here you go. God is pure, Proverbs 30:5 God is Good, Psalm 100:5 God gives Free will,Hebrews 10:26 God is omniscient, Job 37:16 God is omnipotent, Ephesians 4:6 The Earth's age, seriously? Just add the ages of the Adam and his descendants together then after Jesus plus 2000 years. God hates gays, Leviticus 20:13. (I know what it says, and he says kill homosexuals) Time is one of the 2 main components of our universe, nothing can be beyond time. I thought God was all powerful? If he wanted to couldn't he do anything? Including beaming people to heaven? I refer to the Catholic church, The Baptists, The Evangelicals, The Methodists, The LDS, and The Presbyterians. If God already know what you will do before you do it, than you have no free will because your fate is pre-determined. So he is testing the 400 million starving children? Or those 15,000 thousand kids with Cancer? Or all those people who died in the holocaust? Or all those women who have been raped? That is no test. What are 400 million kids going to learn from slowly starving to death? What are you talking about? God and organized religion are directly connected. Organized religions only exist because they believe they know what God is and what he wants. We can not say that he does or does not exist. But we can Absolutely say which is more likely. I can not say that a flying unicorn does not exist, but we can for certain say that it is extremely improbable for such a creature to exist."	PRO	550

Sometimes GOD performs immediate miracles to our church while we are not aware or not asking for it. Many from our church brethrens including my self have experienced miraculous works of GOD from a vehicular accidents. When I was riding inside the motorcycle cab, the front wheel of my tricycle was removed. Our tricycle fell and roll 3x, I thought I will die or will have a serious injury. But GOD save me from that very moment I was not hurt compare to one of my co-passenger which was hurt and wounded. Scores of my church brethren experienced being bumped by a fast moving vehicle, fell few meters away but miraculously saved without scratches or serious injuries, contrary to the vehicle's bumper which was broken. GOD saves us too from raging nature calamities just like what happened to our church brethren from the past Japan tsunami tragedy last month. All of our church brethrens were saved , their houses was not damaged compare to their neighbors with dead love ones and their houses were destroyed. It will took me dozens of hours if I will write all miracles happened to us from tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, blizzards, fires, pestilence, plaques, from poverty to financial freedom. from sickness to wellness, and etc... etc..

S5fcb7dea-Afc2c0741	homosexuals going hell ? religion is a joke	"REWARDED WITH VIRGINS Well, I certainly don't subscribe to the fact that men will receive virgins in heaven. But, your religion also states: ""And there shall wait on them [the Muslim men] young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls."" (Quran 52:24) ""They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who will seem like scattered pearls to the beholders."" (Quran 76:19) So, it won't be all that bad for yuo, I guess. :) my friend the true meaning of that verse is: if a man desires to have a kid, he will have him without the complications of the normal life, not the other thinking in your head lol not to have sex with him. you said: BAD GENES I actually do not believe, as many do, that homosexuality is a genetic issue. I believe that it is a psychological one. Not that it is a type of psychosis, but that it is the result of opening one's awareness to something that becomes an obsession. Like people who can't be faithful to their spouses because of their heterosexual impulses, I feel that something opened you up to this and created a fascination with you that you cannot shake. It's almost like an addiction. That's my own belief, but I admittedly do not have many facts to back that up. man where do you live, you want to back this up. ok tell me, what is th case with she males? they have a mans part stuck down, what about lisbians, what abot the men who do operations to transform to a woman? they are all incomplete humans this is my theory, its not an obsession you cant chose a religion for me, i am happy for you that Christianity have served you well for 20 years. can i ask you something, can you be frightened by your own religion? need an example? how far do magic and jin are mentioned in the bible (gods other creatures invisible to the human eye and also mentioned in the holy quraan, and can be driven away or burned by reading specific verses. one time i was trying to sleep at about 4 am in the morning suddenly i felt someone is strangling me i was about to die, it happened more then twice, this happened becuase one of my friends was at my house working in his computer and running sorat yaseen from qu'ran. the next day i told him what happened to me. a week after another friend came to stay for the night when he went for sleep, the same yaseen verse was running on speaker my friend was sleeping in the same bed as i was, we saw him strangled and flipped and his arms was behind his back, there is no way he can do that to him self, i have been in that situation and i know better. i asked eldery people about this phenomenon and they said some people have spirits inside them becuase they do not pray to god ......etc you know the drill, therefore they try to choke you and torture you when hearing that verse. this may be science fiction to you, but these things makes me believe that something about quraan is true, unless some ancient guy really knew how manipulate humans from words of wisdom and i do mean people get burned, levitate, scream with un earthly voices. (there is more but i think i have said enough about islam sci-fi which sadly is not fiction) in our islam the most hated fact about it is a secret you might not know it! did you know that if someone was jealous of you he can put a simple spell on you that will give you bad stomach, headache and un explained pain., just by having a piece of clothe or hair and a photo with you. with some candles and needles and bang there you have it magic to bend jin with humans to harm them. we always find things you don't want to know about at sea shore. (sealed magic, sealed words mixed with candle to bend souls) what i am saying is, i do not think that there is any other book like the holy quraan that can burn this magic and remove it. you may not believe this until you see it with your own eyes (we also have people who fake this, still when you see the real thing you will believe) you see my friend i do believe in some of it, i am still angry about the homosexuality and this dogma they have from reading the book and doing by everything written in it like its the only truth. (if i had a chance to confront my people with the situations that contradicts Islam i would be killed) so my religion serves me well if i follow it on my own terms, but if i follow it under my nation terms i would be dead by tomorrow morning ! and also one funny fact, this site is blocking any ip address from the middle east due to spam (becuase arab are close minded lol) i had to fake my ip in order to come here and debate ! now to the debate every religion has contradictions and can be misused thus making it a joke for not being able to live with it. if the old people who wrote the bible and quran stood by every word in it and done everything that was said, they either were going to be noble or being blinded by truth this debate comes to an END, i have enjoyed this pleasant debate i may have upset some twins lol and i am sure some of you had fun reading this, greetings to all"	PRO	554
S97247301-A17876564	Obese Christians should be taught that they will burn in Hell	"Mr and Mrs O'Beece were sitting at home watching television as they did all day every day. On this particular occasion they were watching a documentary about sub-Saharan Africa. ""Golly!"" exclaimed Mr O'Beece between mouthfuls of pizza, ""Look at that lion tear that antelope limb from limb: I'd love to be there to witness that in person."" ""Yes,"" agreed Mrs O'Beece, ""and I'd love to see with my own eyes some of those savages with bones through their noses go hunting and gathering in the savannah."" ""Well, why don't we then?"" said Mr O'Beece and he Googled 'African wildlife vacation' on his smartphone and booked flights to Nairobi and a room for two in a luxury safari hotel in the Kenyan bush. It should be explained at this point that Mr and Mrs O'Beece had serious weight issues and, as a result, that they each needed two seats on the plane to accommodate their vast bulk. They didn't pay for two seats each - that's not how airlines operate - instead two other passengers on their flight were forced to sit in jump seats to make room for them, and as the aircraft lumbered into the sky under the burden of the O'Beece's extra weight the couple tucked into the first of their many complimentary on-board meals. On arrival at their safari hotel, Mr and Mrs O'Beece wasted no time in taking seats on the restaurant veranda which overlooked the plains where they ordered a scrumptious feast of succulent Philly cheesesteaks, spicy BBQ pulled pork, juicy hamburgers, crispy southern-fried chicken nuggets, tasty hot-dogs, crunchy French fries, buttered corns-on-the-cob, golden hash browns and delicious baked beans in a rich tomato sauce - and gallons of refreshing, ice-cold Coca-Cola to wash it all down with. For dessert they ordered Belgian waffles with double chocolate fudge ice cream and as they tucked into their banquet they asked the waiter where all the animals were. ""Oh, a terrible disaster has visited our beautiful land,"" lamented the waiter, ""The rains have failed three years in a row and many of the animals have died, and the bushmen and their families are also starving to death."" With that, a native Kenyan girl of about ten years, all skin and bones, homed into view. She was on her and knees scratching in the dry earth looking for tubers, seeds, grubs or anything else that might be vaguely edible. Presently, the little girl spotted Mr and Mrs O'Beece and she came up to where they were seated. She gestured with one hand to her open mouth and with the other she pointed to the mountain of food on the table. Mr O'Beece rose from his chair, his face purple with rage. ""Get your filthy black hands away from our food, you thieving little nignog,"" he roared and the poor little girl screamed in terror and ran away as fast as her spindly legs would carry her. ""What sort of world are we living in?"" said the similarly outraged Mrs O'Beece, ""Surely we should be allowed to eat our meal in peace without being pestered by Negroid urchins?"" Mr and Mrs O'Beece aren't very nice people, are they boys and girls? No, they are not, but they are not unusual. In rich countries like the UK and the US, where food is relatively cheap and plentiful, over a third of the adult population is obese. These gluttons continue to shovel junk food down their bloated necks while over a third of children in developing countries are malnourished. Shame on them. I do not hold any religious beliefs myself but I do think that Christian preachers should teach these stinking piles of sweating human blubber that they will surely burn in Hell as a consequence of their obscene gluttony, greed and sloth which are the main causes of obesity and also three of the seven deadly sins.

If the consciousness we have is nothing more than God's consciousness, then God is the one who does all the bad stuff that ever happened on earth before he attains to nirvana and realizes he is God.

Sa2c55bd3-A8ff717e9	God is not real	I'm only responding to claims that you made! My points were that nothing you said had a logical link to therefore there is no God. Your whole case assumed he existed only to ask why he would do such a thing. This is assuming existence considering you appear to be asking why he did something rather than whether he did something. Hence I assumed existence when saying there is an answer for him doing said thing. Now you say it can not be argued that mass genocide would be done by a 'benevolent' creator, however why not? I would assume as you are an Atheist, that you don't follow an absolute morality, unless you are particularly fond of Kant's Categorical Imperative. I'm an Atheist myself, however even I can see that morality is entirely a social construct that makes society more stable. If everyone killed everyone and stole everything, it would be a disaster, and so fundamental rules are introduced that develop over time, and here we are agreeing that mass genocide is 'bad'. This is because if mass genocide was good, humans would be wiped out. However if there existed a God, his morality would be the the absolute morality, and whatever we believed would be wrong. If the creator of an absolute morality deems mass genocide okay, then that is how it is. It sounds horrible, it is horrible, but only from the perspective of a UK citizen in the 21st century. Heck even 1,000 years ago, genocide in the crusades was considered fine if with just cause. What we perceive as right and wrong may be wrong if there were an absolute morality, and so nasty things happening doesn't mean he doesn't exist, but simply that we are wrong. You call being unable to comprehend the mind of God as an escape hatch argument, however if there were a God, are you honestly saying you would be on the same intellectual level? A sentient force that could see all and do all? I suspect not, and neither could I. We cannot say that our own confusion means that God doesn't exist. It was not 'designed' to be understood by men, it wasn't like God wrote the Bible and handed it to Jesus where it was then distributed. The gospels were written by actual people a long time after the crucifixion, and so it is extremely likely that whatever words Jesus spoke or actions he did would not have been properly documented. This makes the Christian religion at least most likely a farce because it bases its services and prayers on texts written by old men years and years after the events. As a result it is impossible to guess what the desired message was. You ask again if an omniscient God would allow such a thing, I simply don't know. You would say no. I would say that I don't share this God's omniscience and so can't claim what he was thinking when he did things that we don't understand. Religion is completely based on interpretation, are you joking? Everyone sees the Bible in a different light and takes a different message from it. Some people cherry pick good parts, others bad. As a result it means that everyone is probably wrong, but doesn't mean a God doesn't exist. You seem convinced that the Bible is the direct word of God, it simply isn't. It was not written by God and no one claims it to be. It was written by scribes who likely got things wrong. Again you mention that if we don't like what God is saying he must not exist, it simply doesn't make sense. This God may show love in a different way to us, again we are only humans, and to claim that emotionally we are up there with the creator of everything would simply be nonsense. I don't believe in a God, I would identify as an Atheist, but arguing logical fallacies in the Bible will get you nowhere. There is no reason to think that a God would follow our logic, and so even if he did exist, we still would have no idea why he did anything he did. In Amazonian tribes they glorify child sacrifice, something we would be repulsed by, and so we shouldn't be surprised if other barbaric (by our standards) acts are glorified by this God. There is no way to even claim that God isn't real when you look for inconsistencies in scripture. All you can do is look at probability and conclude that God is so unlikely that you don't think he's there. This does not however 'mean' that a God doesn't exist. Your arguments all seem to imply that we ought to know how a God thinks. I ask why is this?	CON	557

Sa4ec9664-Aed2df105	Jesus Christ Has Not Done Everything In His Power To Save People From Hell.	"Hello, and thank you for bringing up this debate. i go to a christian school... which might help me :P first off, i would like to quote you ""He may have given us the opportunity to be saved, but this is presuming that he exists. The biggest step of all is to believe that he exists, and I do not believe he has done everything in his might to prove to everyone he exists either. "" Also, to make things easier, I beleive in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Let us pretend (even if you don't) that you refer to thge christian faith as if it is real, so we don't get completely off topic... I worded that wrong, best I can do. Why does he have to prove it? All religion is based around faith, and you took up a scientific standpoint. You don't ""beleive"" in science, you back it with evidence. Religion is the exact opposite. You put your faith in him, and that alone can and will save you from hell. I want to quote some things, that will hopefully show that he does not have to prove himself and be physically here to be known to everyone, because it is pure faith Scripture is clear that if you seek, you will find (Deut. 4:29). Of course, ""seek"" means seek, and God responds to a serious and diligent effort (Prov. 2:1-6; Matt. 7:7-11). If you put FAITH in him, he proves himself. Why should he prove himself to probably don't even care I beleive Jesus did enough. He shouldn't have to say ""wow, we are in a desolate land with no technology. heres a computer, go play."" No, he doesn't have to, and he shouldn't have to. People that contstantly perform miracles are fakes.... Like ancient egyptians, many of there prophets utilized this stuff that made wild sparks and then small explosions as signs... Stupid. We know how to do that now, but what HAVEN'T we figured out? How to cure cripples, leppers, and the bling with skin and saliva. Jesus performed miracles to better the world, and many others did to wow people. Jesus wanted people to beleive in him trhough truth, not through amazing acts."	CON	559
S9958d011-A270e1af2	Christianity is not real.	Round 3 | Rebuttal and Arguments | by Eav | 9/11 Thanks to my opponent again, it has been a pleasure so far. Round 3 Structure [Addressing Rebuttal 1] Lack of eyewitnesses 1a: Flavius Josephus 1b: Tacitus [Rebuttal 2] Contradictions [Argument 2] Logical Approach [AR1] Lack of eyewitnesses 1a: Flavius Josephus was born very close to Jesus death. At the time he heard the stories people who knew Jesus were still alive. His writing clearly indicates that he spoke to eyewitnesses and though all of them could have been lying, I don’t see a reason why all of them would, because not all of them can have been Christians. The time of FJ had no media and creating a person like Jesus would have taken much more time to spread and ensure. And we can see that FJ is not a blind believer; because he shows doubts concerning the rising of Jesus. If he was critical enough to doubt people there, he wouldn’t ignore if the majority of eyewitnesses or contemporary witnesses would report that certain events never took place. 1b: Tacitus Nobody likes to quote a filthy Roman. Seriously, that Tacitus was ignored that long comes clearly from him being anit-Christian. Also for a long time, the gospels were considered a proper source {4b} for Jesus existence, scientific methods were still in development. Tacitus relies on what he knows from Romans. That means he used Roman documentary and Roman witnesses. If he concluded that Jesus existed, than based on stories from Romans who put a lot of effort into making Jesus a myth (or at least profited highly from that). How many secretly christian-reborn-Romans could there have been to falsify Tacitus report? [R2] Contradictions I can only repeat what I said before, in Round 2: That the bible doesn’t necessarily needs to be right, holy or reasonable. It is no reliable source. But it indicates that it interesting to find out, on who it is based. The bible is based on Jesus, therefore effect. Jesus existence is not bound to the bibles reliability, because that was the cause. I have tried for two rounds now to keep this scientific, but my opponent keeps attacking the bible without realising that this arguments base on the logic of fanatic Christians: that the bible is a reliable report and has fallen from heaven in the holy wholeness that it is. It isn’t, and I pointed out before why. If Jesus did not exist we could still have the Bible, but we would not have reports like those from Tacitus and Flavius Josephus. (Fig.1) The contradictions actually point out that Jesus did exist (see A2), also because, if Jesus was fully made up, someone would have made sure in the editing process, that nasty contradictions don’t occur. But for the sake of proper rebuttal, I’ll address the given contradictions shortly. 1: “Love yourself and your neighbour” pelages you to forgive. Doesn’t mean god will. The two statements don’t work together because that the sinning humans should forgive each other stands in no relationship with Gods final judgment of them. Not a contradiction. 2: Borderline. Jesus was raised in a society of racist people but to our modern views this sure sounds racist. But with Jesus being primarily the promised saviour for the Jews he did have his point there. Jesus was not perfect. Till his resurrection he was human. 3: Oh that’s lovely! Just as many, many things said by Jesus, this a metaphor, meaning that however necessary and loved and belonging one thing or person is, if it causes you to sin, it’s time to leave it behind, even if this feels violent. Who would be so mentally deluded to think that his foot can make him sin? [A2] Logical Approach It seems unlikely that Christians all over the world, even only a few years after Jesus supposed death doubtlessly fell into blind believing, especially because the bible wasn’t written yet, nor one of the gospels. They must have had other sources telling them about Jesus. And these sources reported mostly the same. Con has picked some contradictions to point out why the bible is not reliable: I say, that there are only so few contradictions is surprising. Actually unlikely if they were based only on the conspiracy of … twelve people? With the gospel of Mark being the base narrative for Matthew and Luke, it’s clear why we have more similarities between them than to John {4a}. But that John who lived significantly after these three (~130 A.D.) and used none of them as source {4a}, still gathered information so much similar overall, is an indicator that there is some real cause that keeps the stories somewhat similar. If Jesus had never existed, the bible would be a big conspiracy by a few people that managed to spread a story so effectively that even hundred years after it was developed, people still would gather extremely similar information about a person that nobody had a reason to believe in apart from being suicidal. Has anyone recently skimmed over all the contradictive material we have about people like Hitler and Stalin? And during their lifetime we had proper recording methods. I don’t see a way how people could have pulled that stunt to invent the person Jesus from scratch. Sources {4a} http://www.bc.edu... {4b} http://www.bc.edu...	CON	560
S6cca42d6-A56695e53	God and Hell cannot simultaneously exist (take 2)	"I would like to point our first of all that I am a debater and I don't like it when people switch arguments in the last speech either so you don't have to worry about that. The point I was trying to get at saying God has the power and desire and everything I said following that, I was saying that just because someone has the power and desire for something does not mean that thing will happen. I do not know how much clearer I can make that statement. I do not understand how you win this just because I stated something that you did. I was repeating what you said yes but trying to prove a point as to the fact of what I have already stated numerous times. A) The statement you made about the parents and having a car, that made little sense. I say that because you said ""they will, by definition, have a car."" Well seeing as the definition of HAVE is ""to possess, own, hold for use, contain"" (found at dictionary.com, last updated in 2006), how could the parents actually have the car if they have not physically bought it and therefore have it in their own possession? Like with God and having the power and desire to want people to go to Heaven, just because someone has the power and desire for something to happen does not mean it actually will happen. B) I was not arguing that God does not want people to go to Heaven. He wants us all to go, but like I said, we have to do certain things. We are all naturally born into sin. We are not born as saved people, we have to ask Jesus in our hearts and ask Him to forgive our sins and accept that He died on the cross for our sins. Some things are just a certain way and this is one of them. Like I said in my first argument, getting to Heaven is a reward in a sense because it is like when we were kids. If we did what our parents told us to do we would get a reward like extra time on the computer or playing outside right? Well this is the same basic thing. God is our father in Heaven, and our reward when we die if we have done everything He has told us to do is going to Heaven, instead of the eternal punishment of going to Hell. This is not self-contradictory, you just took it that way. 2) Again, looking at dictionary.com, the definition for all powerful is ""having or exercising exclusive and unlimited authority; omnipotent"" and the definition for omnipotent is, ""almighty or infinite in power, as God."" So there again, the definition has nothing to do with Him not ""needing things"" as you basically put it. Like I said in my above argument, some things were just made to be and this is one of them. I am not God, so I cannot give you all the answers as to why He did what He did. I can only give you and the readers the most logical explanation I can give and hope that you understand what I am explaining. 3) As to me only explaining the Christian aspect of things, I am explaining it that way yes, but that is because that is the best way I know how to explain it. I wouldn't expect you to go out and try to explain something in a way you didn't know how to explain it. When someone tries to explain something, what do they do? They explain it in the way(s) they have been taught and that makes the most sense to them right? So why is it that just because the way I explained this to you is something you don't understand, it automatically makes no sense? So my conclusion for my closing argument is simply that I did interact with my opponents arguments just fine. Just because I admitted to something that my opponent said does not automatically mean that he wins. It simply means that I agree with a certain aspect of what he is saying and I am trying to explain why certain things are the way they are. And just because I have stated things in a certain way that maybe he doesn't like or understand does not mean that the readers do not understand. So as for my arguments against his, I did attack everything he brought up many times and in no way contradicted myself. I win this debate on the simple fact that I did disprove his case, he just does not want to see it."	CON	561
Se0ba8977-A289a0f8d	Christianity is the ONLY true religion with a REAL God.	"---Then why do other religions name their ""god"" in different ways?---"" Rebuttal: This is a bit off topic on ""Christianity is the ONLY true religion with a REAL God."" But, I""ll indulge you. The word ""God"" is a matter of historical of linguistics. During the Roman Empire which dominated much of the Middle East, most people spoke Greek, with exception to specific professions. Early Arab Christians were using the word Allah prior to the formation of Islam. Other words for God are as follows: Yahweh, Elohim and Elah-Hebrew & Arabic, El-Greek & Hebrew, Theos-New Testament Hebrew & Greek. The word Christian came from the Greek word Christos. God: Danish""Gut, Flemish""Goes, French-Dieu, Polish-Bog; shall I go on? How is the translation of the word God relevant to your claim on who is the ""Real"" God? ""---They also have different beliefs and mostly myths."" They don't understand science enough to prove that their religion is ""right---"". Rebuttal: Here again, this statement is a matter of contention on validity with myths in your religion verses myths of other religions. Many religions have parallel story telling with your Bible. Hinduism, Ancient Egyptians, Aztec and Christianity share a flood myth. The concept of angels has roots in Egyptian mythology, as well as Bacchus paralleling Moses. The theme of a god who sacrifices for the people, Pangu-Chinese, Ymir-Norse; parallel Christian myths as well. The Greek myth of Dionysus rising from the dead; does that sound familiar? As far as different beliefs are concerned, I made a point to show religious commonality. ""---They don't understand science enough to prove that their religion is ""right----"". Rebuttal: Here is the science end of your premise that has yet to be addressed. I""m still looking for your ""scientific"" argument that your religion is right and your God is more real than others. In Summary: You have not addressed many of my rebuttals points, but specifically the question if other religions are, or are not worshiping the same God. You have yet to provide proof or logical argument that other religions are false, as well as what defines your faith and God as the factual real deal? http://www.bibleanswerstand.org... http://chestofbooks.com... http://catholic-resources.org... http://orvillejenkins.com... https://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.sacred-texts.com... http://www.eoht.info... http://thoughtsandvisions-searle88.blogspot.com... ."

Sd686be90-A2f4431c9	Santa Claus is Real	"Wow. Your argument is based on literally almost no premise. You did not bring up my Religion? I laughed out loud when I saw that bullsh1t. Look in the comments: ""You do realize that all my arguments were just recycled arguments for christianty that I changed to accommodate Santa Claus. Just saying."" Stated by JR himself, personally. There is no such thing as ""Babble"" or ""10 commandments of Santa"" or anything else. I presume you made that up yourself. Go do an internet search, if you can find a website as evidence, I admit that there is a new Religion about Santa. Not a Religion made up by yourself. Unless you make up some bullcrap about you walking up a hill and receiving a tablet with the 10 commandments of Santa from Santa himself, and then throwing the tablet onto the ground and causing a massive earthquake, I don't think there's any way to rebut this. I regret to reply to you that you have almost no backup evidence for most of your claims, except for some. It is time to accept the cruel reality, and not live in the idyllic reality that you believed in, and continuously deceive yourself. That reality will be shattered, broken by me. It is about time you learn, most 15 year olds already know the actual, sad truth. (Sad to you, that is) ""Santa will not give any of those super cool awesome presents to anyone. I will simply say this is not true. He just won't give them to you because you don't believe in Santa. Santa would most definitely give all those presents to me because I have faith in Santa."" Please, this is not how a 15 year old argues. In that case, I would like to the the Epic of Gilgamesh (tablet) in your hands, and you gaining immortality and floating to the moon, and you being omnipotent, omniscient, and stronger, better, than Santa. (Who is a lie) Prove your power right now, by destroying all the 7 wonders of the world. It will be on the news; fear naught, I will definitely be fking watching. Fyi (For your info), saying that you do not have the items right now/saying I have to wait till Christmas is basically a win for me. If you had read through the Christmas List which I recommended, you would have noticed ""Potion that gives you the power of Time (Kronos)"" The future you would have teleported back to the past and destroyed the 7 wonders of the world. I hate it, especially when idiocy and ignorance is the hardest to Debate, as they cannot see your points, and ignore them. In your first paragraph, you state that Parents are testing their Children, pushing their beliefs of Santa to their very limit. Right off the bat, I believe I have found a fatal flaw that you have made. ""When you turn 18 years old an adult will inform you of the real truth. The shocking truth. The truth that Santa is real and he was the one actually giving the presents the whole TIME!!!!"" Now, readers. How about you go search internet. And find out what *EXACTLY* is wrong with this damned statement. Or, any of you, could ask a 18 year old (and above) person and ask him if his Parents have fking said that Santa was real. The evidence is absolute, concrete. I dare you, JR, ask someone on this Debate Website, who isn't bribed or in cahoots with you, to answer this question truthfully. Your Second Paragraph is also bullcrap. Let me point out the flaws in your argument: ""The reason that the parents had to pretend that they were giving the presents is because Santa refuses to give teenagers presents because to often they ask for drugs and other illegal things. The only way to make teenagers not request things from Santa was by having the parents pretend that Santa wasn't real so then the teenagers would immediately assume this was true."" Firstly, teenagers do NOT ask for drugs and other illegal things/alcohol. Any educated teenager would know that drug and other illegal things harm the body. Majority of teenagers are educated (in my country), almost all are. Besides, drugs are only for one purpose: Joy. Peace. Happiness. I am sure Santa could grant pills that don't harm the human body, making the teenagers happy. As for the government part, as my readers should know, total bullcrap. I should have skipped that; I lost a few neurons. And I mean that literally. Santa does not have to deal with all the drug and alcohol requests made by teenagers? Are you kidding me? He could solve that problem instantly with a flick of his hand; he is omnipotent, as stated in your above argument. Most of them are bullcrap, but they are also unfalsifiable. They have absolute no concrete evidence that can be proved. Your statements have absolutely no evidence at all. This is not the work of a 15 year old. As for the Science, I'm afraid, Science is nothing, if it cannot be proven, or is too imaginative and stupid to be logical. Science is supposed to be a logical way to explain things to people, to get them to understand. The Science part was good, but your foundation which you built your claims on was bad. Oh wait, you don't actually have a foundation. Are you retarded... We need concrete evidence, not something out of a Child's imagination. Btw (By the way), Santa wouldn't need to go to a fking research lap to get researched, especially if he is omnipotent and omniscient. He shouldn't bother to even acknowledge the humans. He is, after all, omnipotent. He could just snap his fingers, and BOOM! Scientists understand everything about him. No need to go through dreary things like that. Note that the Elves use technology higher than that of the humans (diamond machines). That contradicts your earlier statement about toys having same technology as humans. Note that Santa has no use for Elves. He could create all toys with a snap of his fingers. Also, he does not need to climb down a chimney, considering that he is omnipotent. He can do anything he wants. Yet he does not solve chaos, death, and others. But *NO* he continues to make toys and give out toys .-. .There is a serious flaw in this. Santa has no use for any servants. God however, has use for Angels and Humans. He balances everything. He makes the Dark, he creates the Light. He kills, and resurrects. He makes the rich, he creates the poor. Wow, an intern. Sooooooo believable! Hey, you readers out there, how many of you believe this story? You have no evidence, concrete or not, to support your claims. Do you not understand? I can say that: God gave me a task. God gave me a reason to be in this world, I was born to eradicate idiots like you off the face of the Earth. God himself told me. God told me, I have a reason. He told me, when I was 5, that someone like you would come and talk about Santa. God predicted and foresaw this. Yeah, he did. He is guiding me right now, I can hear his voice. Note that all those are bullcrap. But this, is how exactly you sound. You have no evidence, and they aren't even half solid concrete. I have a bad feeling you're smarter than this, and you're just waiting for the final Debate. *NOTE THAT PRO HAS NOT REBUTTED ALL MY STATEMENTS, AND ARE CURRENTLY IGNORING THEM! THIS IS A SERIOUS MISTAKE FOR HIM! THIS EITHER PROVES THAT I WIN (AND THAT HE HAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE) OR HE AGREES WITH MY STATEMENTS!* I shall now compile & summarise the Rebuttals that you have ignored: Rebuttals not rebutted: -Wikipedia, and almost all links related to Santa states that Santa is false, fake, and a lie. This surely proves something. -None of the non-believers of Santa has received coal for Christmas ever in their lives. -God is real, proven scientifically, historically, logically, is a widely held belief, and in my case, a fact. God has almost literally been proven, the part where it is proven Scientifically is based on a *strong foundation*, while yours doesn't even have a foundation. -Destroy the 7 Wonders of The World, right here, right now. I haven't seen it yet. You can also claim credit for destroying the 7 Wonders of The World. -Santa does not need Children's wish lists, he is omniscient, and already knows what everybody yearns for or wants. -Most of your links are unfalsifiable. Get better concrete, hard, evidence. ""I have solid evidence behind the existence of Santa"". Don't make me laugh. -He answers ""at least 90% of the time"". What is with that ""at least"" and ""90%""? Santa is, according to your statements and claims, omnipotent. He can answer 100% of the time. - If Santa was indeed omniscient and omnipotent, he would not need anybody to catch him on a mere technological device (that is, a camera). Neither will he need a child to catch him putting presents below the Christmas Tree. It is hardly evidence and illogical. Santa would wanting to be on tape is pure crap. -You yourself admit that Santa's thinking is flawed. Isn't this strange? Starvation. Hunger. Tragedy. Overpopulation. Santa does not solve these problems, instead he gives out presents to kids. -""Santa is helpful to everyone and uses his immense power very wisely."" You usually say a sentence like this when you have a limited/finite amount of power. But remember, Santa is ""omnipotent"". So he does not have to use his immense power very wisely. Santa does not have a great plan. The more I read, the more you blasphemy. -There is no such definition of ""Babble"". In your context, you state that this ""Babble"" is a book. Allow me to show you: Babble: talk rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way. Somehow, it admittedly suits you. -You admit that you copied some statements from the Bible, and changed them. Gtfo, and Stfu. Saying one thing while Debating and saying another thing in the Comments section widely affects your position. -You have no evidence, concrete or not, to support your claims. Do you not understand? -There is a serious flaw in this. Santa has no use for any servants, yet he has elves to make toys when he could materialise them out of thin air. -Elves have higher technology than Humans, but the toys are still the same. -More rebuttals but out of spac"	CON	563
S9a809f39-Af4b42f6b	The Christian God is Real	"I thank Con greatly for his elaborate rebuttal. I will first address the problem of why to pick Christianity over some other religion, for if I cannot disprove that, I cannot prove anything else. I cannot critique every single religion that is not Christianity. I don't know all of them, or I can't list all of them in here critiquing every single one. Please state one to promote instead of putting it in a vague term of ""other religions"". But there is one thing in common with all these religions; they are not very clear. Another thing I can do is promote Christianity above all of those so it becomes the best possible choice by far. Unlike what Con had said, the gospels were NOT just ""merely names written on a piece of paper and are not related to anyone we know of"". We have other documents of these people not only in the Bible. They are not just mere names. We must have a certain amount of trust in these historical figures, or there will be no history whatsoever. How do we know Alexander the Great is a real person? He might just be a fictional story made up by some idiot. No, we don't believe that, because we have evidence of writings and other artifacts proclaiming that he was a real man. Any historian scholar specializing in the life of Jesus can tell you who these people were and give you evidence of who they really were, using actual documents. They were eyewitnesses of Jesus. This cannot be proved false with the information provided. Now, knowing this, we can say the Bible wasn't just written by an anonymous person. We have 4 different perspectives of the life of Jesus, each unique in its own way written a couple years apart from each other. In these gospels, we can see the life of Jesus from the very start until his resurrection. Before Jesus died, he fulfilled prophecies of the Old Testament. The dating of the Old Testament was thousands of years back from Jesus' life. In the Old Testament, there are many prophecies that are in them, such as Jesus's side being pierced, his resurrection, his crucifixion, and many others. These were all fulfilled by Jesus. There are no other religions in which this happens at this scale. Jesus was predicted by the power of God. This is why Christianity is superior to other religions. Life has more of an elaborate design than something that would happen just by chance, as you have stated. For life to happen, there has to be energy, liquids, and others. If there are none of these, life cannot exist. It would not just be a different form of life; life would NOT exist. These are the factors I have relayed into my analogy to the black and white balls; life is almost an impossible feature that will only exist under perfectly balanced conditions. Morality, according to Con, is the recognition of every life because there is price on every life (an effort). If there is an effort on every life, why not just kill off the old people since they are just taking up space and not putting any effort into society? Why do we love others so much? This love is above just recognition for his effort. Morality ties to God because we are different from animals. We don't only have an ""evolved morality"" that is a little above animals. Animals do not feel as we do; they cannot love or feel other feelings like humans can. Because God created us as moral beings in the likeness of Him, we can love, make decisions, and have character.

S3796484f-A4486f2e5	Heaven is real	"It's dinnertime at the Alexander home, in Lynchburg, Va. Holley Alexander is serving chicken curry, 14-year-old Bond is hungry after soccer and the dad, Dr. Eben Alexander, leads the family in prayer. In this home, saying grace is different these days. This family has been touched by a medical miracle -- and maybe more. ""It was impossible after impossible after impossible that all these things happened,"" Alexander said in an interview with ""Nightline"" co-anchor Terry Moran. Alexander, a Harvard neurosurgeon, nearly died four years ago when a ferocious E. coli meningitis infection attacked his brain and plunged him deep into a week-long coma. Brain scans showed his entire cortex -- the parts of the brain that give us consciousness, thought, memory and understanding -- was not functioning. Doctors gave him little chance to live and told his family that if he did survive he'd probably be brain-damaged for the rest of his life. ""Nurses would come in, and they would pull his eyelids back, shine in the flashlight, and his eyes were just off and cocked,"" Holley Andersen said. ""It's just like no one was there."" Against all odds, Alexander woke up a week after being stricken. But he believes Holley was right: He wasn't there. Deep in coma, his brain infected so badly only the most primitive parts were working, Alexander claimed he experienced something extraordinary: a journey to Heaven. ""In every sense, of the word that's what my experience showed me,"" Alexander said. ""My first memories from when I was deep inside: I had no language, all my earthly memories were gone,"" he said. ""I had no body awareness at all. I was just a speck of awareness in kind of a dark, murky environment, in roots or vessels or something. And I seemed to be there for a very long time -- I would say years. ""I was rescued by this beautiful, spinning, white light that had a melody, an incredibly beautiful melody with it that opened up into a bright valley,"" he added, ""an extremely verdant valley with blossoming flowers and a just incredible, rich, ultra-real world of indescribable complexity."" Alexander said there was a young woman who soared across time and space with him on a butterfly wing and gave him a message to take back from Heaven. ""She looked at me, and this was with no words, but the concepts came straight into mind: You are love; you are cherished; there's nothing you have to fear; there's nothing you can do wrong,"" he said. God was there as a vast presence of love, Alexander said, and Alexander understood God through an orb of brilliant light. ""It was all of eternity and all of conscious existence,"" he said. ""But it was this brilliant orb of light that was almost as necessary as a translator to bring in that message from the divine and the incredible."" After he recovered, Alexander, who was adopted, was shown a picture by his biological family of a sister he had never met or seen before. He recognized the sister as the young woman from Heaven. ""I looked up at that picture on my dresser that I had just got and I knew who my guardian angel was on the butterfly wing,"" he said. ""It is the most profound experience I've ever had in this life."" Of course, many would call Alexander's experience a hallucination -- but not him. ""I know this is not a hallucination, not a dream, not what we call a confabulation,"" Alexander said. ""I know that it really occurred, and it occurred outside of my brain."" It was a near-death experience -- like those reported by thousands of others. But Alexander was determined to prove scientifically that it happened. In his new book, ""Proof of Heaven,"" he raises and then strikes down various hypotheses on how his journey could not happen. Alexander said he is scientifically certain that his stricken brain could never have produced the images and ideas he experienced -- or remembered them. ""If you would have asked me before my coma, How much will someone who is in coma for a week with a severe bacterial meningitis -- so severe that the sugar level ... around my brain, normally around 60-80 and in a bad meningitis maybe down to 20; in my case it went down to 1 -- to me, that's just one piece of evidence of how severe this was. If you'd ask me how much would that patient remember, I'd say nothing,"" he said. ""They wouldn't remember a single thing. ...The severity of the meningitis would have prevented dreams, hallucinations, confabulations, because those things all require a fairly coordinated amount of cortex."" Alexander isn't fazed at all by the skeptics. He was one, too. Now he has ""proof of Heaven,"" he said. ""For me, it's become clear that the best way to look at it is to turn it around and realize that consciousness exists in a much richer form, free and independent of the brain, which has everything to do with the eternity of our souls and the fact that our awareness, our consciousness, our soul, our spirit, does not depend on the existence of the brain in the physical universe. In fact, it's freed up to a much richer knowing when we're outside."""	PRO	565
S41674061-A2d47b107	is evolution real	"Unfortunately, Most of the population today believe in evolution, More specifically macro-evolution. But believe me when I say that it is not because of the evidence. You will understand this concept as you read. But anyway Macro-evolution is the belief that life started as one organism and that organism reproduced and slowly developed into million of species in a process that took millions and millions of years. For example, It is believed that in the space of 2 million years, A dog can develop into a horse. A fish can develop into a bird and so on. In this round, I am going to attack the overall concept of macro-evolution from these Scientific standpoints: The details of the fossil record, Structural homology, Molecular biology, And mutualism. The Details Of The Fossil Record: Evidence Against Macro-Evolution If Macro-evolution really happened, The first place you would look for confirmation would be the fossil record. After all, If dogs did eventually give rise to horses, Then we should be able to find fossils of animals somewhere between a dog and a horse. These are called transitional forms because they represent a transition from one species and another. Unfortunately, Very few of these were ever found. And even those were highly questionable. So instead of finding the transitional forms that paleontologists thought they would find, They found mostly gaps. The core of macro-evolution argues that species give rise to species in a slow, Gradual process that takes years on top of years. But the fossil record reveals a very different story. This is the sudden emergence of entirely new species with no apparent immediate ancestors. Consider this for a moment. Macro-evolution attempts to explain the earth's past. But because we don't have anyone who lived 20 million years ago to tell us that macro-evolution happened, We have to look for data that either support or refute the idea. The first place to look for data would be the fossil record. What does it tell us? It says macro-evolution never happened. The transitional forms that would be necessary for one life form to change to another simply do not exist. If the STRONGEST piece of data to tells us that macro-evolution never happened, Scientists simply should not believe in it. Structural Homology: More evidence against macro-evolution: Now to my next argument. Structural Homology is the study of similar structures in different species. Before I explain why this is evidence against macro-evolution, It is important to understand why it was originally believed to support macroevolution in the first place. Darwin supposed that if two species shared similarities in different parts of their bodies, Then this could be evidence that there is a common ancestor. Consider this link that shows the structural homology of different species limbs. http://itc. Gsw. Edu/faculty/bcarter/histgeol/paleo2/homol1. Htm In this example, The limbs of humans and cats, And horses are actually surprisingly similar. Darwin supposed that this could be evidence that they had a common ancestor. After all, He supposed that by natural selection the original ancestor could over big blocks of time could, Give rise to many similar species. This would be exactly like people supposing that you and your brother grandson's are related because of your striking similarities. In Darwin's time, This would have been an excellent argument. How could such similar species not have a common ancestor? Well unfortunately for macro-evolutionists we know that this happens because of Mendelian genetics. You see, If structural homology was the result of common ancestry, It would show up in genetic codes in the organisms that possess similar structures. Take for example, The link I showed you of the structural homology of a human, Horse, Cat, Bat, Bird, And whales limbs. If all of these came from a common ancestor, Then the corresponding parts of their DNA should be similar. Is this the case? NO! That's not what we are dealing with. Dr. Michael Denton points out that the apparent homologous structures in different species are specified by quite different genes. He is right in this case because as scientists have studied genetics, They find that this is indeed fact. Because of this, There is absolutely no way that these could have been inherited by a common ancestor. If there was a common ancestor, Then the genes and the DNA would be somewhat similar. We know that this isn't even remotely close to the truth. Molecular Biology: Strong evidence against macro-evolution Aside from DNA, The most important molecule in the chemistry of life is a protein. All life forms have them and without them, There would be no life at all. The protein I will go into is called Cytochrome C which takes part in cellular metabolism. It is made up of a series of amino acid sequences which varies from species to species as seen below. https://docs. Google. Com/document/d/1rN6jYckpQfu3VTflNWTyj2a8g38l6L78_rYlZHHkw3Y/edit Notice in the chart each of the proteins are very similar which isn't a surprise because the protein is the same in each case. The proteins between the horse and kangaroo are nearly identical. But because of the one difference, The cytochrome C for a kangaroo will not work at all in a horse and vice versa. Proteins are made in cells according to the instructions of DNA. Thus, You are looking at the differences between specific parts of these organisms genetic code, That is the part that determines the make-up of the protein. If macro-evolution is true, Then this chart should indicate how ""closely related"" the two species are. If they are distantly related however, That should reflect in the chart I just showed you. Now, Let's compare the Cytochrome C amino acid sequence in several different species. Let's start with the horse and kangaroo. Percent difference: 1/11 x 100= 9. 1% difference When we compare the Cytochrome C amino acid sequence between a horse and the yeast however, There are 4 differences. 4/11 x 100= 36. 4% difference This data tells us that the kangaroo is more closely related to the horse than the yeast which makes sense from a macro-evolution point of view because according to them ""complex life forms evolved from simple ones. "" Well, If this were true, Than it should reflect in the next chart I show you. Check out the bacterium Rhodosprillum Cytochrome C amino acid sequence and see the percent difference it has from other species. https://docs. Google. Com/document/d/1V_4ApE6bQ7nMZE-hd16NOpJ8QBYIO8nZ2RLwlk02FtE/edit The bacterium is the simplest life form on earth. Of the organisms listed, The yeast is the next simplest life form. If it is true that complex life forms evolved from simple ones, Then the yeast should be closely related to the bacterium. That is not the case however. Of the organisms listed on the chart, The yeast actually has a 69% difference from the bacterium while the other much more complex organisms like the horse has a 64% difference. Instead of the yeast being more closely related to the LEAST complex organisms, It is actually more closely related to the MOST complex organisms. The data in the chart shows absolutely none of the evolutionary relationships that should exist if macro-evolution really happened. Mutualsim: The nail in the coffin for Macro-evolution: Today there is something called mutualism which is a close relationship between two species where both benefit. An example of this is between the oriental sweetlips and the blue streak wrasse. The Oriental sweetlips is one of the few fish that has teeth. However it must get them cleaned otherwise they would rot and fall out. So, The blue streak wrasse cleans the oriental sweetlips teeth by eating all of the plaque on it. This gives the blue streak wrasse a good meal, And at the same time, The oriental sweetlips gets its teeth cleaned, Thus causing both to benefit. Macro-Evolution states that one life form came into existence from dead matter. This process by itself is impossible but that is aside the point. For now let's just say it happened. That life form reproduced creating every species of animals we see today. In order for macro-evolution to be true, This case of mutualism would have to have come across by chance. At some point in time evolutionists would say that the sweetlips probably had no teeth but in a number of generations, Teeth began to form. In order for these teeth not to rot, The sweetlips would have to develop the instinct to seek out a fish to clean it's teeth. This instinct would have to develop at EXACTLY THE SAME TIME THE TEETH EVOLVED. But that's not enough. At the exact time these instincts evolved, The blue streak wrasse would have to INDEPENDENTLY decide to swim in the sweetlips mouth without the fear of being eaten. Remember, If these don't happen at the exact same time, The process won't work. That is just one of millions of examples of mutualism. There are just too many of these happy coincidences for evolution to be possible. Conclusion: Today there is just too much data that Macro-evolutionists completely ignore. There are a few reasons so many people believe in it today. One, If Macro-evolution is not true than you have to accept that there is a God in the equation. After all, There really isn't any other explanation other than evolution of how life originated. Accepting that evolution is false means accepting that God is real and accepting that God is real makes a claim on your life. Another reason so many people believe in evolution is because for the most part it is not allowed to be taught in high school classrooms and college classrooms. Thus, Because the idea of evolution is so universal, It is the only thing that students have to base their beliefs on. There aren't many people that believe in God these days so their only option is to put their faith in science. But those people have to understand one thing. Science will fail us, Everything in this life will. Sources in comments"	CON	566

S224da923-Ab4b660c2	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"both teams began going through changes from 2008-2009"" 1. Real Madrid experienced pretty much all their change at the end of that season. As you stated they started off badly trying to one up each other rather than playing as a team, which is why they have only just recently tapped into their full playing ability. Yet again the titles of years gone past are futile when discussing which team is currently better. Also ill say this to keep it simple for you, 2008-2009 6 trophies, 2009-2010 1 trophy, 2010-2011 5 trophies 2. All I'll say to keep this simple is Real Madrid has 52 points on 51 goal difference. Whilst Barcelona has 45 points with 47 goal difference(1). This is CURRENTLY, not 2 years ago. This is against the same opponents over a consistent period of time. Its true is doing well but again messi has better foot work and more assists and easily goes past players and overall plays much better than Ronaldo in each game. 3. As I proved last round in last Year's La Liga Ronaldo's goals and assists were a greater combined total than Messi's. Saying Messi has better footwork is subjective, in my opinion Ronaldo has proved to be a better player due to his versatility. He made the UEFA team of the year in 2004 as a midfielder who got 9 goals in 50 appearances. Yet he made it this year as a forward with 53 goals in 54 appearances. He has proved he can be the best in different positions in different leagues. He has not played with the same team since he was 12 doing the exact same thing. He has only just recently truly adapted to his position in Real Madrid a bit like how the rest of the real Madrid team has. In fact the most relevant point to this is the fact that Ronaldo currently has 24 goals to Messi's 22 in La Liga whist only having one less assist. This is not a debate over which team has been better over the last few years or who has made a team in a more ethical way it is simply a case of which team is currently better which is clearly Real Madrid. By the way in terms of all people thinking Messi is better here is a poll from January 2012 which has 59% choosing Ronaldo over Messi currently. lastly as I said before its true Madrid has the lead in la Liga but it hasn't beat Barcelona once in this league. 4. Time for another Man City example. In the 2004/2005 premiership Chelsea lost one game and drew the other with Man City but finished 43 points higher.(3) As mentioned the last time these two teams played it was at Barcelona's ground where it finished a draw. Madrid play foul and dirty 5. In last season's La Liga Real Madrid got 94 yellow cards to Barcelona's 95. (4) When a strong gust of wind will cause the Barcelona players to go to ground it is obviously going to look as if Madrid has ""fouled"" them. As I've stated before it is less a case of teams kicking Barcelona because they can't play football with them but rather that Barcelona can't match up with them physically. As Rafa Benitzes stated Premier League is quicker and has bigger physical demands than the Spanish championship(5), meaning that Barcelona are in a league that helps their tic-tac 5ft8 average height style of team. If these teams played in England or Germany Real Madrid would have even more than the 7 points they currently have on Barcelona. (1) http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com... (2) http://www.goal.com...

Sabfed07a-A2424262e	official catholic church teaching is that noncatholics and unbaptized infants go to hell	"If making a political statement given the times is a disqualifying factor for evidence, then my opponent is out of luck. The only reason the Catholic Church made such exclusive political statements regarding other denominations was the fracturing during the Reformation. For example, many of the strict requirement for Baptism statements were to challenge reformers like John Wycliffe who were denying the necessity of Baptism. Con has undeniably failed to disprove any of my evidence from Vatican II. Con states that Vatican II is a political statement, but provides no evidence. Additionally, Con doesn't dispute that Vatican II was authoritative church teaching. Even if it was a political statement (and it wasn't) that would not prove it is not authoritative. My opponent does not effectively dispute this evidence, and I will reiterate what my evidence says ""The non-Christian may not be blamed for his ignorance of Christ and his Church; salvation is open to him also..."" That is the debate in that line right there. My opponent says the Church teaches non-Catholics go to Hell. Vatican II says they can go to heaven. According to Vatican II, if a non-Catholic or non-Christian acts as God wills they will go to heaven. If my opponent was correct, Vatican II wouldn't say non-Catholics could be saved, it would say they were damned to Hell. What does my opponent say on my evidence? ""even a rigorist wouldn't necessarily deny this at this level of abstraction. again bottom line is you have to read it in a political vein, and then consider the weight of everything said about the matter."" I will focus on 2 things he says here, and I believe he has basically conceded the debate right here. If a rigorist Catholic would concede that non-Christians may be saved, what are we even talking about? You are taking a rigorist perspective, perhaps the most rigorist perspective possible, and you agree that a rigorist would say that non-Christians have the possibility of salvation? As for the weight of everything said about the matter, this is exactly my case. The Church said in 1441 that salvation is not possible outside of itself, but at Vatican II the Church changed that position. The weight of the statements at Vatican II are of the highest authority. As I pointed out in my explanation of magestirium, a statement made by the Pope speaking ex cathedra carries the same weight as statements made by a council convened by the Pope. The most recent Church teaching on who gets into heaven is that non-Catholics and non-Christians can get in. My opponent dismisses this as a political statement. Would the Catholic Church issue a findings of the highest magestirium, from a council that speaks infallibly on faith and morals as a mere political statement? No! And to say so with 0 evidence provided to back up that claim is frankly ridiculous. Unless my opponent can, somehow, prove that Vatican II was not authoritative, than he will have failed to fulfill his burden of proof and he should lose the debate. As of now, I would say that he has failed to do so. The other thing my opponent said was-- ""most of your quotes just says other Christians have got some good points to them, it doesn't say anything definitive."" If the quote in large, bold font was not clear enough, I will provide a couple more that show that, as stated at Vatican II, non-Christians can attain salvation. ""The brethren divided from us also use many liturgical actions of the Christian religion. These most certainly can truly engender a life of grace in ways that vary according to the condition of each Church or Community. These liturgical actions must be regarded as capable of giving access to the community of salvation."" Their actions are ""capable of giving them access to the community of salvation"". Non-Catholics can access the community of salvation through their actions even though they are not Catholics. If they can access the community of salvation (the Church), they can access the salvation. My point at this point should be pretty clear. The Church says, definitively, that non-Catholics can attain salvation. It is possible. The Church may say that non-Catholics and non-Christians achieve a Catholic salvation through the Catholic church, but they can receive salvation nonetheless. On infants and aborted babies going to hell-- the Church does not have an official position. I will concede that it can be inferred that, since they are unbaptized, they would be damned. However, as I have previously presented, the Vatican has no official position of damnation. The Church believe that the mercy of God would allow these infants to go to heaven. Additionally they may be viewed as martyrs, since their deaths are the result of rejection of Catholic faith. Either way, the lack of an official position is clear, and the fact that they aren't damned is clear in this newly discovered (really took some digging) official position, approved by John Paul II in 1992 and written by a council which he convened in 1985. The Catechism of the Catholic Church contains the most recent, official and, most importantly, authoritative, position on the issue of pre-baptism infant death. ""As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,' allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism."" The Church does not take the position that unbaptized infants are saved, but it does not take the position that they are damned. Any concrete answer to this question is pure speculation, because the Church officially does not have a concrete answer. My opponent may speculate that, since they are not baptised, they will be damned. I may speculate, as the Church does, that since they are innocent and since God does not have to abide by the sacraments, they may be saved. Either way, the most important thing to take away from this passage is that officially they are not damned, so my opponent is wrong. http://catholiceducation.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... This ended up being far longer than I intended, but I never intended to find the CCC thing so I guess it all works out in the end. Conclusion for round 2: my opponent has failed to prove that Vatican II was not authoritative, therefore he has failed to prove that official Church teaching damns all non-Catholics. My opponent has not yet had the chance to respond to my latest finding on the official position on infant death, but the official position is that they are not damned, so we shall see. In any case, as my opponent has the BOP to show that both (infants and non-Catholics) are damned, I would say that, as of now, he has not fulfilled his burden."	CON	570
S67121bf1-A68db44e1	Religion Science and Philosophy should not be separated, they all point to a common and real truth.	"I would first like to start by saying what I must do to win, and what my opponent must do to win. The resolution has two parts, first and foremost, that Religion, Science, and Philosophy should not be separated. I must prove they should. And secondly, that they all point to a common and real truth. I must prove they don't. My opponent must do the exact opposite. Now as for my first point. 1. Religion is defined as ""something one believes in and follows devotedly; a point or matter of ethics or conscience."" 2. Science is defined as ""a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws."" 3. Philosophy is defined as ""the rational investigation of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct."" When we look at the definitions presented, we see three different things. Not one in the same. If they were one in the same, then they would not be three different things. Three different things cannot be the same if they are different. Just like a red dot cannot also be a blue dot. It is impossible. Since they are three different things, they must stay that way. Now does this mean they should not be separated? Not necessarily. The reason these things should be separated, is because of their vast differences. Let's look at religion first. Religion has not been defined as one specific religion. As we all know, there are many different religions in this world we live in. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, are just a few of the major religions. Now the question I pose is: Can all of the religions co-exist peacefully together along with science and philosophy? I say no. Not only can they not co-exist peacefully with Philosophy and Science, they cannot co-exist peacefully at all. There are radical groups of muslims whose goal in life is to kill christians. There are radical christians whose goal in life is to kill others. These groups will never co-exist peacefully. Should these groups be separated? Yes. Most definitely. Now, should religion co-exist with Science? In some points yes. It should. But in other points, no. It shouldn't. Paul says in one of his letters, ""It is by FAITH you are saved, not of works, lest any man should boast."" Since science is purely factual, then you will see that faith and science cannot co-exist. Especially since one calls for believing in the unproven. Religion says that the person who adheres to the guidelines set up in whatever religious book believes that those guidelines are true, whether there is evidence to back them up or not. Science says you must believe the laws because they have been proven true. A scientist cannot say that we must believe cold fusion is possible because he says it is. If there is no evidence to back that claim up, then science says it doesn't have to be true. So that means religion inherently is separated from science. Now as for religion and philosophy. These two are already very similar. And I would argue with your claim that they are separate in the status quo. I would say they are already united. Now for Science and Philosophy. These too are very similar. But there are some differences. Science is what is true, and Philosophy is finding what is true. That means that Philosophy must come before science. One cannot exist without the other. If we never searched for what was true, then we would never know truth. That means that they each have to exist individually. They cannot be combined. The search has to be before it, and it cannot exist simultaneously. How can you be searching for a certain truth while already knowing what is true? It can't happen. Now for the second part of the resolution. ""They all point to a common and real truth."" My first question...What truth? You never told me what they point to. All you say is that there is a truth. How can I argue that without knowing what truth it points to? I would also like to point out that there is no such thing as a fake truth. I say that they do not all point to one truth. Let's look at religion first. As I previously stated, there are many differing religions. If one religion says that after I die I will spend eternity in heaven, and another religion says that I will spend eternity in Hell, or still another religion says that I will be reincarnated as an oak tree, then how can they all be pointing to the same truth? They cannot. Now science. Can science and religion point to the same truth? In no way. Religion has to do with a person's soul/karma/whatever. Science doesn't. How can science, which says that after I die my body will rot in the ground and release chemicals to help the soil and plants, point to the same truth that says I will live again as a cat? Science doesn't deal with that part of life. So they cannot point to the same truth. Philosophy doesn't point to anything in particular. It just says that it is the search for truth. Once you find that truth, you enter into the realm of science if it is a proven fact, or religion, if it is something you believe to be true. Therefore Philosophy cannot point to the same truth as science or religion. Your arguments on the relativity of truth don't have any weight in the round since the resolution doesn't call for an argument in relativism. You do say a ""real"" truth, and since relativism is well...relative, it can't be real or common. So... You say that everything must have a final answer, a real true answer, and i agree. But not everything can point to that real true answer. Only certain things can. Not all religions can point to that one real true answer. So therefore, Religion can't point to a real true answer. Certain religion(s) can, but not all."	CON	571

All sex outside of marriage is sin. Marriage is when a man and a woman become one flesh. Why would righteous people like Martin Luther King Jr. be killed? It's a shame Martin Luther King Jr. had to die the way he died, but we all must die one way or another sooner or later because we have all sinned against God, none of us is righteous. We all deserve to die.........I would prefer to be shot dead and go without suffering like the Reverend King did. His sudden death was a terrible tragedy and an immeasurable loss to humanity, he was a great man, but nobody is righteous so they do not deserve to die and nobody is righteous so they deserve a long life. Time is a gift from God, he gives it or He ends it as He sees fit. God did not want things to be the way they are, God did not want everybody to have to die. It's not God's fault that man chose to rebel against Him. God cannot deny Himself, He must be true to Himself, he must keep His Word and He told man he would die if he rebelled. So here we are, dead in sin, rebels permitted a reprieve temporarily before God's justice is finally executed against our rebellion. Sad it fell on Reverend King so suddenly when the man was such a fine, great example of bravery and leadership. Why would God create cancer and other fatal illnesses to plague those who have done no harm? God did not create these problems. These things resulted from man's rebellion and the corruption of man's body caused by man's rebellion.........If God did not allow time for man to go on in the world after man rebelled, none of these diseases would have appeared as none of Adam and Eve's descendants would have been born. You are trying to blame God for things man caused. As long as you insist God is not real because He is allowing problems to continue for now, you can only hate God or deny God is there. He loves you and He wants you to trust Him so He can fix you, get rid of all of the corruption that is in you and in your body, and give you eternal life. He made a way to make this possible. If you insist is is impossible, you won't come to know God,. God wants you to know Him and He has revealed Himself. He is calling to you........He wants to save you from eternal death and give you eternal life. He can do it. I can tell you how. He did it for me. I know He can do it for you. I know He is real, and I know He is watching over us. He is keeping account of everything and He is going to settle all accounts forever and restore perfection to His creation. Man messed things up. Don't blame God for man's problems. Thank God He gave mankind enough time for you to be born. I'm glad you are here. God loves you.	PRO	572
S58afba79-Afce18424	The Holy Spirit is real	"I will split Round 4 into three parts on my behalf. First I will rebut what you said, second rebuttal of your videos, third will be my conclusion. PART 1 1a. If someone had been supposedly abducted by aliens would you believe it if there were over 5 witnesses all saying the same story? It's the same thing with the Holy Spirit but instead of over 5 people to testify, 2 billion. 2a. The Bible describes the way the Holy Spirit works in our lives, how he is our friend, and figuratively, God's Word proves that the events that occur within human beings' lives are truly caused by the Holy Spirit not their imagination. Frankly you're the one who missed my point. 3a. If you can find me an experiment done without human intervention that plainly proves how something can form from pure nothingness, this debate (and all God debates) are OVER. But this has NEVER been done and never will be done. Let me quote you: ""Scientists are working on a collider that can turn light into matter. Once this is achieved, your holy spirit theory is dead, simply because this places humans as powerful as your alleged holy spirit power. Of course this has to be accomplished but the implications means if humans can do, it can naturally occur on it's own."" Do you know what you are saying? I think the voters/readers can find the fault in this way of arguing without further ado. 4a. Now I see. This WHOLE debate you haven't known the purpose of the Holy Spirit or who He is at all! I recommend you watch the videos I posted just so you can have a better understanding. First of all, most say that speaking in Tongues is simply--as stated in the video YOU posted--a way the Holy Spirit gives us prayer, which we give as praise back to God. [2] [3] http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... ""When they spoke this tongue, everybody understood it, the Scripture lists 18 different languages that understood it AT ONCE! Not like today's so-called tongues where only another possessed person can think that he understands it."" This is more proof you don't know what you're talking about. Read this article and you might understand better [4] Acts 2 is irrelevant to this because it is the Tower of Babel we are talking about here. [5] 5 and 6 a. I'm not going to bother venturing too far into my opponent's argument... But to clarify--AGAIN--I must say that I was not referring to Benny Hinn or Jim Jones or Creflo Dollar, I was referring to the random followers of (Pentecostal) Christianity who believe whole-heartedly in the Holy Spirit. Read (6.) again. 6b. Exactly: you can't ""babble"" like Anita. If you knew what speaking in Tongues even meant, I wouldn't be having to go on about this. Every Christian who supposedly receives the Holy Spirit by speaking in Tongues of Men and Angels does not know what the Holy Spirit is flowing through them but knows that it is a unique language even though they cannot understand it. PART 2 I don't see your point for showing the Lonnie Mackley video except that you were trying to show how you think the Holy Spirit sounds in a bad light--in other words, you did it to ridicule the man. Benny Hinn was a real actual fraud but that is not what we are debating. An atheist video to make atheists feel good... I don't see your point for showing the video by ResotredCOG... Did it ever come upon you that speaking in Tongues is not the only thing to shun here? I will not bother explaining exactly what I mean since there's not much more we can debate as this is supposed to be my last round. :(] PART 3 The debate has been particularly a waste of time and I didn't appreciate my opponent's effort put into basically shunning the concept of a tri-God or Holy Spirit for 3 whole rounds. Yet somehow I have hope that voters will see my point of view and realize Con was wrong in a lot of areas, especially when accepting this debate (as he barely knew who the Holy Spirit was). In conclusion I will say that the Holy Spirit hasn't been refuted and I had to spend half the time explaining and retelling my case so my argument could only go so far. Thank you, RichardCypher, for doing this with me and I say God bless for your last round. SOURCES [1] http://www.gotquestions.org... [2] http://vimeo.com... [3] http://www.cru.org...

Sae4073fd-A4d5279c	Some cryptids are real	"You said ""Cryptid- a creature not yet discovered...ALLEGED sightings that are UNCONFIRMED. My argument is not irrelevant and I understand this debate My opponent is not proving anything to this argument, just because you gave me a definition of what a Chupacabra is, does not mean it is real. I looked it up myself and it says it is a LEGEND, not factual. To emphasize my point I found an article that says an ""Chupacabra story is a hoax; likely a Xolo dog breed. ""The animal, described in an Associated Press report last week as ""a cross between tow or three different things,"" was found as road kill last month near the Texas town of Cuero...""this animal is a Xolo,"" said top dog breeder...""The do looks like it has Xolo genetics. This is not a Chupacabra--that's absurd."" Continued, ""The focus has been very distorted...""I believe it's more of an issue of animal neglect or possible abuse than it is a chucabras wandering in from the bush."" Even a ""local veterinarian who has seen the carcass doubts that the animal is anything noteworthy."" The article even describes the history of an alleged ""chupacabra"" it starts of saying ""The legend,"" not a recorded animal. Here is the link if you would like to take a look. http://news.mongabay.com... And the video you linked on your last argument, didn't even exist anymore. Scientific Fact is an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true.

Sa4352af2-Aae9747bd	The God of Classic theism is real	"My opponents last round was also littered. I find it interesting that my opponent repeatedly bashes me for using Bible verses and being ""almost entirely void of logic."" I'M the one void of logic? Really? Yet my opponent has waited TWO ROUNDS and STILL not given my ANYTHING to attack that is COINCIDING with the resolution! ""The God of Classic theism is real"" Please present me an argument that DENIES God! Brief road-map, I'll be defending my case and attacking my opponents case My opponent didn't attack my newspaper argument. ""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov...... This tells how the earth is tilted and gives measurements. THIS COULDN'T JUST HAPPEN!! If I put a stack of newspaper in the backyard, it will NEVER be the same stack of newspaper on a windy day. NEVER. Not without Intelligent intervention. So the world isn't moving from Chaos (the big bang) to order. Its moving from order(God creating it) to chaos."" My opponent discredits My arguments by saying they are ""Void of logic"" and ""Littered with bible verses."" ""Void of logic."" I love it:) I'M the one void of logic? Read on... ""The premise of this argument is based on a false dichotomy. [2] Even if evolution weren't true, that would not prove that God exists. However, evolution is most certainly true. We know for a fact that humans and all other animals are related in terms of their ancestry. Among other strands of evidence for evolution, all animals share the same genetic coding, DNA. And we can use this code to compare the genetic sequences of any two species of animal in order to determine how closely related they are. As it turns out, humans share 98 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees [3], and we share less with our more distant cousins, elephants. Moreover, all of this genetic evidence helps form a beautiful hierarchical family tree among living creatures. We (homo sapiens) are but one twig on that tree, and we are related with every other living organism on the planet, including bacteria and plants"". -Freeman OK, but according to my opponent ""I NEVER ARGUED THAT EVOLUTION DISCREDITS THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. Moreover, my opponent's argument in this section has already been demolished. Nothing else needs to be written on this topic."" His ONLY ATTACK on my C1 was evolution existing, so my C1 STILL STANDS despite my opponents objection. Read the all caps, ""I NEVER ARGUED..."" OK, then your attack on my C1 doesn't discredit my C1, because I said ""If God doesn't exist then who created us all?"" In attacking My C2. Lets see...In response to this my opponent says:""This isn't even an argument."",and ""I admire my opponent's fantastic ability to form delightfully tautological and self-sustaining arguments. However, it would be improper of me not to point out that these modes of argumentation fail to meet certain standards of reasonableness."" THIS proves my point! THIS CONTENTION is what you are supposed to be debating! This says ""God is God"", coinciding with the resolution, and therefore requiring an attack. Nevertheless Freeman has failed to attack my C2 because it is ""tautological""[1] and ""self sustaining"". If arguments aren't meant to be self sustaining, then apparently my opponent means one's OWN arguments are supposed to uphold and agree with ones opponent's arguments, a practice he has adopted in this debate, as I have proven above in reference to his attacks on my C1 and C2. ""As far as I can tell, my opponent did present one minor objection to the syllogism I have laid out, so I will address it briefly."" What do you call this??? ""1a)I agree b)His son died to save our sins... 3)True. Absolutely. Here's why: John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2)He was with God in the beginning. (3)Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. (4)In him was life, and that life was the light of men. (5)The light shines in the darkness, BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD IT. .:Therefore God exists."" I will expand upon my arguments on #2 and 3 2)""If God wanted humanity to know that he existed, as many theists often propose, then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him... God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, if he does exist."" WHO do you think you ARE to say this. How DARE you say what the all knowing God should do? According to my opponent, believing is apparently a forced matter, or that God should FORCE us to believe in Him. Belief:""confidence; faith; trust""[2]. He goes on to say that ""If God wanted humanity to know that he existed, as many theists often propose, then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him."" Belief requires cooperation from the person beleiving. God provided an abundance of evidence i.e. prophets and the Bible, which YOU refuse to acknowledge. 3)This argument makes NO sense. Its OBVIOUSLY true. They refuse to acknowledge the Bible, God's prophets (i.e. Isaiah, John the Baptist, Elisha), and more importantly His Son Jesus. God wants all men(people) to believe in Him before they die, because if they don't they'll go to Hell. I don't believe in gravity. I deny all proof, reject the men who tell me I'm wrong, and denounce Sir Isaac Newton as a liar ad a lunatic. Even the existence of it since God created the earth has no effect on me. Its all bogus. This is an example of why proof doesn't always guarantee belief. Proof is inevitable, but I can still deny it. #) is to make defending/attacking easier This is where it gets very interesting: 1)""The second premise of the syllogism has nothing to do with free will or its negation."" Either one has free will or not 2)""If God exists and wants all humans to believe this before they die, then he could appear before the world in order to demonstrate his existence. According to the Bible itself, God did this with Moses on Mt. Sinai and he also revealed himself to other people through Jesus. So, even from a biblical perspective, God could bring about a situation whereby everyone believed in him without compromising their free will."" Now my opponent earlier said: ""If God wanted humanity to know that he existed, as many theists often propose, then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him. As such, if God existed and God wanted us to know this, then reasonable non-belief should not occur. But reasonable non-belief does occur because God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, if he does exist. This, it would seem, entails a contradiction."" Now, by reading both arguments thoroughly, one should see the contradiction easily. Paragraph #2 says Reasonable unbelief is warranted because of lack of evidence of His existence, and because God ""should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him. My opponent also said God is ""mysterious"" and should reveal himself. But paragraph #1 says God could ""appear before the world in order to demonstrate his existence. According to the Bible itself, God did this with Moses on Mt. Sinai and he also revealed himself to other people through Jesus. So, even from a biblical perspective, God could bring about a situation whereby everyone believed in him without compromising their free will."" #2 Says He's mysterious, #1 says He's revealed Himself. Neither DENY God's existence, which is what my opponent is supposed to be doing. As one can see, my opponent cannot ATTACK God in His next round because then i will only have 1 round to defend. My opponent admires my ability to create self sustaining arguments...thank you. [1]http://dictionary.reference.com... [2]http://dictionary.reference.com...

Sa1b869c0-Aca443ba6	heaven and hell were created just like Jesus name was	"Well the Concept of God and Heaven always has been more of a Answer to the Question ""Why are we here"", ""What is the Meaning of life"" As far back as you look, Humanity with its deep thinking, Has unlike other species. Questioned its utter existence, Said questions result in other beliefs that are said to provide evidence. I do not doubt that many have used their ideas to simply justify Violence and Destruction As seen with the Terrorist group ISIS, That uses its beliefs to justify the Atrocities it commits. However I also do not doubt that many Religions often provide a safe haven with various tools to help succeed in life. Many need the concept of God in order to Guide them, While others Simply put. Can Survive without a belief in a Creator. Said belief in a Creator is not wrong or Right, It just simply is. As long as their belief does not discourage other people or devalue people simply for not following the same Ideology, Then Said belief is not wrong to believe in. because after all, It is just a Belief that provides Comfort. Such as you may used Video Games or Music to combat the realities of the world or the daily struggles, They to use the Religion as a form of Comfort. A verity of reasons why they would use it for Comfort could be explained to, That ether they feel the need to use Religion of Guidance due to possible struggles or need to not be seen as just a piece of History in time with no logical narrative to it, That is nothing once you perish from this world. So Humanity believes in Narratives for many reasons upon. Said reasons also create the idea of Heaven in which is a ever lasting Paradise. However the concept of Hell comes to the very question ""Would Bad people be allowed in a Paradise?"", "" Would Adolf Hitler or Genghis Khan or other villains in History be in a Paradise?"" The Answer to that is a unknown, But to the ideas of Religion, The answer would be a No. Religion can be used to justify Destruction, So can other things such as Social Class of Wealth or Ethnic Race or Age. In which practically anything can be a justification for War. However just because it can be used as a Justification, Doesn't mean it always will. Many Hinduism in the mountains of China are very peaceful people that really re frame themselves from Violence. It is not known if Heaven Exist or Not, However I surely believe it provides closure and sanity to some."	CON	576

S224da923-Ac37144d2	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"Your argument seems to consist of 4 main points- 1. The fact Barcelona won a bunch of trophies in the last few seasons, which really isn't that applicable since it is on what is happening currently. I have already stated that over the last 3 seasons according to wikipaedia(the most reliable of sources) that Barcelona has seen transfer transactions at 303.25 million Euros. Real Madrid over the same time has seen 505 million Euros. Even though football players maybe over priced it is clear that the teams have changed dramatically over the past few years making Barcelona's past achievements even less useful to the current standings. As you said yourslf the new Madrid team were a disorganized team at the start and it must be remembered this is only Jose Mourinho's second season as manager. Madrid have improved considerably even when soley compared to last year. They have finderly found their form. 2. Messi being better than Ronado. Whilst I have offered statistical date for Ronaldo being better(being selected to more UEFA teams, having a greater combined goals and assits, winning acolades at different positions) your argument seems to mainly be that Messi has better footwork. It's hard to make a distintion between which has better footwork but my points clearly support Ronaldo. Ronaldo has been the top scorer in different leagues in different teams playing different positons. He has shown more versatility than Messi. 3. Real Madrid never beating Barcelona. My opponent never really offered why my Manchester City point wasn't valid as a rebuttal. The point is that the last 5 coppa Del Rey Matches between these two has seen Madrid win two games , Barceloa have won one game and 2 draws. The last time these two played it was a 2-2 draw in which Real Madrid had more shots and more posession.(1) 4. Barcelona playing ""better"" football than Madrid. This is another very subjective argument. I have proven that Barcelona actually recieved more yellow cards last season and Madrid consistently scores more goals showing them a more exciting team. No evidence has really been used to support the idea that Barcelona pass better or play a more beautiful style than Real Madrid. I personally find the aggresive goal scorer Madrid a better team to watch. Though this debate mainly comes down to my points which have not been refuted. 1. Madrid has a better goal keeper(Prop even admitted this ""And I agree that casillas is the best goally"") 2. Madrid has two world player of the years on it compared to Barcelona's one. 3. Madrid's team has consistently outscored Barcelona's even though they play exactly the same teams on a yearly basis. Proving they have a more dangerous attack. 4. Real Madrid is 7 points higher in La Liga and has a better goal difference. Yet again results of years gone by do not apply to who is currently better, the results of the two teams against the other teams in the league over the past few months does and Madrid have been vastly superior. 5. More Madrid defenders were picked by the spanish national side despite having fewer Spanyards in their defence. Basically this is not about which side you actually believe is currently better but rather who has given the better arguments, counter their opponenents arguments better and who has used sources and facts to present a better argument. I believe I have offered more to show that Real Madrid is better than Barcelona currently. (1) http://soccernet.espn.go.com..."	CON	579
S224da923-Ae45f28fa	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	What you say maybe true but the fact still remains that the last time real Madrid played against Barcelona they only on 1-0 and never once one another game against Barcelona. The difference in points is only because not all the star players in Barcelona were playing. On top of that when we look in 2008 Barcelona won Cope del Ray 4-1 with Atlitco Bilbao, Madrid didn't even make it to the final eight which is sad considering the teams status. The UEFA champions league was won by Barcelona while Madrid again didn't make it into the quarter finals. In Spanish prima league (la liga) at that time Barcelona beat Madrid by 9 points and won the championship. They also won trophies for the UEFA super cup and won the clubs world cup in the same year from 2008-2009. this is a record that no other team has achieved in a year. I watched every single game for both Barcelona and real Madrid in 2008 and all the wins were for Barcelona. when we look at all the games from 2009- 2010 unlike the year before Barcelona only won the la liga but unlike Madrid got a cup that year also beat Madrid both times now so far I still don't see a win for Madrid. In the other league the UEFA champions league real Madrid lost in the knockout round wile Barcelona lost in the semi finals. The cope del Ray cup of that year Madrid didn't even make it to the knockout round while Barcelona did but unfortunately lost to Seville. Even though they lost they did much better than Madrid had done. Let continue toward 2010- 2011 what a surprise again showing that they are currently the best team no matter how tough there games were they regain the UEFA championship while real Madrid lost against Barcelona so still no win for Madrid. Again with a 4 point lead against Madrid Barcelona won the la liga cup so that's two more for there collection. surprisingly enough as you said the only win where Real Madrid for the first time in a while finally won Barcelona and took the cope del Ray. But sadly as much as we hoped they will change they went back to losing to Barcelona again. Why you might ask last weeks game Madrid didn't play well they scored the first goal then decided to play defensively the entire game giving the opportunity to Barcelona to try and score as many goals as possible. If they wanted to waste time so the could win they would've played like today's game where they would keep attacking through the entire game. Last game real Madrid was sloppy compared to Barcelona if u watched the game the stayed in defence couldn't get past the half line and gave Barcelona many chances to try to score a goal. Barcelona were still playing like the way they usually do. same foot work there very flexible formation, the many completed passes and the way they would follow through with the ball which gives them an advantage against Madrid. Madrid has may flaws in the game that need to be fixed if they want to play the way they did today. I am proud to say the first goals were entered by Barcelona but they tied with Madrid which I though was impressive considering that Madrid usually don't play that good against Barcelona. -And about who is better Ronaldo or Messi true there maybe many things that prove each to be better than the other but again if you watched the games yourself and saw the way each plays it safe to assume that messi for one has a much better footwork while ronaldo is faster but messi plays smart and always passes around when he is near the goal to ensure a goal while ronaldo at first was a ball hog and now just tries to shoot when he gets near the goal rather than passing it to someone who might have a better shot. I'm not saying that he shouldn't take the shot but if someone has a better shot than he does and Ronaldo noticed the other player for example Ozil then he should pass it to Ozil. And I agree that casillas is the best goally and he deserves that title because as I mention Madrid stops being offensive after a couple goals then casillas does most of the defending. The goally is the only one doing much work because of the many shots taken at their goal I'm surprised that out of the many shots only a few go in. even if Madrid loses the goally casillas works the hardest so he is the best goally but this just proves that the team has a weak defense compared to others. if your looking for a reference I mostly remember them from the time I watched them but you can check out goalzz.com to view these wins that Barcelona has achieved.

S30b19de3-Abe8cca8b	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	"We aren't talking about good or bad being in the Bible, I do not know where you brought that up. The goodness of the Bible is irrelevant since moral values are not absolute. Your point about Hitler is therefore invalid. You continue to ask if the entire text of the Bible is equally flawed, based on 'major parts' of the text which were incorrect, but this is pure speculation, and therefore, irrelevant to this debate since we only deal with logic, reason, facts, and evidence here. You seem not to understand my thesis when I talk about Maxwell's theory. I was saying that just because a small part of a dissertation is wrong, doesn't mean that the whole is incorrect. The same is true for the Bible, irrespective of the Aether being a theory, and the Bible being a religious document. Again, you continue to argue against the Bible being an ""infallible text"", but your advances here are unnecessary since I already agree with you. Stop should stop trying to force me to believe something that we both inherently object to. You are taking that scripture way out of context and reducing your argument to absurdity. The scripture itself means that we need Christ for us to be forgiven of our sins, how does this translate into God not caring about us knowing him? Again, you take the scripture for the face-value, and allow your own bias to infect your view on it. This can be illustrated by looking at the text objectively, rather than critically, as you seem to do. If you are trying to argue that there is a contradiction between this scripture, and the Trinity, then I would agree with you. It makes more sense to say that the ""trinity"" is not one entity, but all three are distinct and separate individuals. Concerning your point about Hell, let me remind you that you previously said that torture and hellfire was definitely not the same as living in the slums. Since I proved that hell does not have to be torture and hellfire, that allows my analogy to hold. Your point here doesn't really refute much of anything, really all it does is say the opposite of what I just said. Hence, it is invalid. You are very incoherent in your next point (about beaming people up), I don't think we are on the same page here. Again, your following point is also incoherent, I do not understand your context. There are two parts to forgiveness. One is justice, the other is a remission of your sins. Christ took the Justice part onto himself, and now we need ask Christ for the other; if we meet his requirements, which are a broken heart, and a contrite spirit. As for your citations, I was asking for you to show biblical evidence for: ""it was written by men who thought the earth was flat"" ""those people thought the heart controlled emotion"" ""the weather cycle was dependent on animal sacrifice"" ""God hates homosexuals"" ""Earth is only 7000 years old"" As for your other citations which aren't covered here, I was not disputing them. Sorry, I probably should have been specific. As for the Earth's age, assuming you refer to Genesis 5, that only adds up to 1743 years to Noah, and there was a huge gap between Noah and Christ. Leviticus 20:13 does not say anywhere that God hates those who are homosexuals. Only that homosexuality is an abomination and therefore, those who attempt it should die. Again, even if you were correct in these statements, none of these arguments prove that God exists. Time and space are axioms which may or may not exist in reality. You make an assumption when you say that nothing can be beyond time, but what is stopping anything from being beyond time? Since time is only relative to a preferred reference frame, if there is no reference frame for a body to measure time, it could be said that the body is timeless. You again, do not understand how sin and repentance operate in relation to God's power, nor how his plan is set up. The LDS do not hold that the Bible is infallible. In fact, one of their articles of faith state that ""We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly."" As I said, any church is irrelevant to the existence of God. Even if you prove that none of these churches are logical in any form, that does nothing towards your main thesis in this argument. Saying that, if God knows everything you will do, then we have no free will, is akin to saying that scientists control the orbits of the planets because they can predict the orbits. This is nonsensical. Again, you do not know how God's plan operates. We came to Earth so that we may learn the difference between Good and Evil. For some people, starving, being raped, etc, is what it takes to learn this. But do not assume that God must therefore be the cause of this. That is incorrect, since He is not responsible for the actions of people... Look at my evidence for those against organized religion, in favor of their own personal theism. I do not see what is wrong with accepting this, since you can plainly see that people practice it. What makes God's existence more likely is not part of your thesis, and is therefore, irrelevant. Besides, even if it was, there is nothing that shows there is a chance towards one or the other. And probability is irrelevant to this discussion. Your thesis was that God, as Christians/Islam/Judaism know him, is not real. Probability is not within the realm of you argument, and it does nothing to support it. We are discussing possibility. As with most of your arguments here, they say nothing about the existence of God at all. It is irrelevant whether or not God is incorrect in his commandments, or the Church illogical, or anything relating to the doctrine of God, since these things do not prove your thesis. What matters is certain issues related to the philosophical and logical validity of the existence of God himself. This is outside the realm of any sort of error in the doctrine. Philosophically, God is well within reality, and there is nothing to dispute that; logically, or otherwise."	CON	581
Sdf849491-Aa6b77bfa	Why GOD is real	"You are correct in many fronts: I do not believe in God, Heaven, or Hell. That was why I accepted this debate in the first place. I do not say ""oh my God"" when something good happens. I make a point to instead say ""oh my gosh.""You are also correct in saying that not every teen is rebellious. However, many are, and even those who are not are practically guaranteed to have a disagreement with their parents at some point in their life. God and Christian practices have both influenced some of our decisions as a nation, but the original purpose of America was not to worship God. If that had been the case, then the Founding Fathers would have set a national religion, like so many countries before them. Yet, this never happened, because it was this kind of thinking that they were trying to escape from. And yes, of course, animals did have to come from somewhere. But Noah's Ark is simply not that place. That 'place' where animals were first born would be the depths of the ocean, where one celled bacteria started to join together and after hundreds of thousands of years, evolved. I am sure you and your friend are respectable people, and maybe your beliefs in God had a part to play in that. Many people use Christianity to help get their lives back in track, or feel better about their death. I had an uncle who had never believed in God before he was diagnosed with a rare illness- Only about one hundred people in the entire United States have it. He was scared, and not ready to die. He started going to church, and started to believe in God so that he could die peacefully, in high hopes of making it to Heaven. He passed away just last year, thinking he could go on to a better place. Believing in an almighty being can be healthy for some people. Drugatics and alcoholics often turn to religion as solace to help them get back on their feet. I am not encouraging for everyone to just drop what they believe in, because it is their choice and theirs alone. However, I would like to show that atheism is the logical choice, and I hope that the message gets through to not only you, but others on this site. To answer your question ""who is the first person in my family tree?"" I would like to begin by stating the way a devout Christian would. Adam and Eve. Seems the obvious answer, does it not? They were the first two humans, created by God Himself. They had three sons, Cain, Seth, and Abel. But...Wait a minute. How did they have children? Did they 'reproduce' with the only other woman in existence, their mother? Or did God create more women for them? If it is the former, than certainly they have broken many rules that God set in place. Not only that, but their children would probably end up having three legs and one eye, or something similarly crazy and unnatural. You say that you have taken phlebotomy courses, than surely you have also taken enough of basic biology to realize this is not a safe or sufficient way to reproduce. If it is the latter, then how come it is never mentioned in the Bible? That seems like a very important detail to leave out. A similar problem happens with Noah's arc. Only so many people were on that ship, there would have to be interbreeding between relatives. Without evolution and the Big Bang theory, we keep finding ourselves at a standstill, a brick wall that is impossible to break through. The Bible does not answer questions that it did not have an answer for, and allowed it to be to the reader's interpretation and the hope that it is ignored. Finally, it is without question that the Bible has been remade several times. The copies that circulate today have been edited and re-edited by kings who wanted to manipulate their people into following their rule. Aside from potential translation errors from Latin, to Greek, to English, and several other languages besides, crucial changes have been made so that the original Bible may never be discovered. There is proof pointing to the fact that the Bible was originally much more female oriented. However, as times changed into patriarchal society, many women were omitted from the text and the ones that remained became evil or untrustworthy. This was their way of showing that men dominated over women. We realize now that men and women are created equal, but that was certainly not the case in the time of say, Henry the VIII. The idea that the Bible was written by God himself, yet changed so many times throughout history, sort of defeats the point.

Sabfed07a-Aed015fd9	official catholic church teaching is that noncatholics and unbaptized infants go to hell	"there's been plenty of saints who thought the rigorist view. augustine (or aquanism?) said he would hope an angel would appear to the good hearted ignorants. he said this because he knew it was the only way for them to be saved. then there's folks like fr. feeney. sure, he was publically opposed by church officials, but that's because he beleived the original teaching, and the new guys were close to the times of vatican ii. i could provide plenty of other saints. what people believed is indicative of what was taught. ""If a rigorist Catholic would concede that non-Christians may be saved, what are we even talking about?"" it's a matter of how you read it. it is possible for the noncatholic to see an angel or convert before death etc. i concede it's streching things, but that is the nature of a political statement. surely, the only way you could read those rigorist quotes as allowing the possiboity of nons to be saved, is to do loop de loops wih the teaching. except, given the weight of qutoes etc, it's much worse here. con also says that those rigorist quotes were for protestants etc were were not ignorant. he doesn't establish this with any hard evidence, first. second, they deny the plain teachings themselves, and the weight of saints who understood them to be rigorist. for an atheist, con almost sounds like a catholic. he could just argue the teachings contradict htemselves, but that there's more than one offical teaching, thus negating the proposition of the debate. but he tries to argue it as if he were catholic. just an interesting point is all. (well, con contradicts himself and later says vaticvan ii changed the position) when i said most of the quotews weren't definitive, i wasn't referring to the large bold font stuff, as i said earlier. but what could appear defintive is a political statement. the catechism is not considered an official teaching. it is just a teaching. the older catechisms say they go to limbo. limbo is a part of hell. to be considered official, it has to be the pope intnetionally binding the church on faith and morals. that is not present in those catechism teachings. i dont know how con says it can be inferred that they would be damned, and then argue that the vatican has no official teaching of damnation. it can be more than inferred, it is the only option. only unbaptaized infants have only orignal sin. tehrefore, the teaching says they go to he;ll. so, officially they are damned, so my opponent is wrong. we can just agree to disagree about the poltical nature of the vatican ii teaching. but, for catholics, the only way they could be reconciled is to say it was poltical, given the weight of the other teachings. for the rest of people, you can only judge it as politcal or not based on the totality of the situation."

I will assume you believe in the Big Bang Theory, that states that the universe and all matter in the universe was once contained in a single point. But does that make sense? how can the matter of all the universes be fit in a singular point? Can you prove that it was? Can YOU, personally show me the reasoning and evidence behind it? no, of course you can't. But we'all just take the words of our scientist and have faith that what the say is true. The same is for religion, we take the world of the people in charge that what they say is right. ************************************************** -- People who believe in God are afraid. They are afraid of life, afraid of the unknown, afraid of tomorrow and afraid of death. It is human's natural mentality to be afraid of death. ************************************************** Well your first make a generalization that religion is for the fearful, and that people who believe in religion are inherently fearful. this is obviously not true for every one and it cannot disprove God. ************************************************** -- If God existed, why would he let people fight over his existence? When people fight over religious ""turf"" or beliefs, they are practically saying, ""My imaginary friend is better than your imaginary friend... now die."" It is this fighting over which religion is the truth that leads me to my next point. -- How can somebody believe THE TRUTH when there are so many? There are hundreds of different religions spanning the globe. With each religion, there is at least one God. And do you know what each of these Gods are saying? They are saying that they are the one, only, true God. There is so much conflict as to which religion is right between these ""Gods"" that either they are really confused, or they don't exist. ************************************************** Just because we have the free will to chose how we want to believe in god, does not disprove his existence. I understand where you are coming from; if god existed would not his message be the same to all people. But well all have the free will to chose how we want to worship god and what god really means. Just because there is diversity in religion cannot disprove his existence ************************************************** -- Each society has their own God that protects whatever it is that they believe. In America: God protects equality and life. In places in the Middle East: God protects sexual dominance and monetary beliefs. And I can prove that places like America have decided for themselves how or what God is.

So obviously, either Jesus lost some melanin somewhere along the line or the American society decided what he looked like to appeal to greatest number. Again i must say so what? If we see God has our personal defender of peace and freedom, or one of social justice and morality, it all comes back to our own freewill to chose God for our own image. If we chose to move away from the will of God, it is sad but our choice. Freewill does not negate His existence ************************************************** -- Throughout history, we can look back at fascist or totalitarian government and see that people do not or are afraid to question authority.

So, either God doesn't exist, or he is one stuck-up entity. ************************************************** Well, first off, I have never heard some one say have faith in the government, in fact if some one was to say that, I would be very much concerned.

You and I both know that police officers exist. We both know that judges exist. We also know that lawyers exist. Those are socially accepted, recognized and respected careers. But, let's not let our imagination get too far ahead of us. It's a rather bold declaration that there is one being, so powerful that he controls all the universe and all of our lives. God is a creation of our imagination. To believe that there is something as powerful as that is non-pragmatic because the capabilities of said God, set forth by any religious text, are beyond the realm of natural capability. -- People who believe in God are afraid. They are afraid of life, afraid of the unknown, afraid of tomorrow and afraid of death. It is human's natural mentality to be afraid of death. Let's face it, just about nobody wants to die. But some people are so afraid of death, that they create an alternative reality. They tell themselves over and over and over and over and over... that there is a God, and once they die, they will get to live in Heaven, a place of bliss and eternal life. They tell themselves this so much, they actually begin to believe it. The plausible existence of God is a result of a scared person telling himself that ""everything will be okay.""

Sfd336fc2-Ac5e24c1f	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	"""You need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star."" -Friedrich Nietzche It's OK to be a little insane as long as your heart's in the right place. It's never OK to be evil though, especially if you're a god who is not subject to temptation and conditioning. But really I don't believe in an insane personal deity that's trying to understand himself, so why am I saying this? Unlike you, I don't believe that perfect fulfillment is metaphysically necessary, because I have absolutely no justification in doing so. Look around you: Perfect fulfillment evidently just ISN'T, and that's a brute fact. Sin exists here, so fulfillment can't be perfect ANYWHERE, for ANYONE. Not even God. Therefore we are here to fulfill a real, ultimate goal. If Hell is eternal, then sin will exist somewhere for all eternity and perfect fulfillment will have been an illusion altogether. Unlike your theology, my twisted theology predicts the end of sin and the ultimate triumph of God. God, the perfectly fulfilled personal deity, couldn't have created the world. I tend to agree with the scientific community that in the beginning, there was a singularity in which all mass-energy was absolutely separate from all space and time. In the beginning, there was nothing but empty, unfulfilled BEING: complete and utter separation. In the end, there will be neither space nor mass-energy for they will be one (heat death). There will be no separation, and therefore complete fulfillment. Needless to say that I'm drawing a parallel between the physical and the spiritual: I'm a Nondualist. It's atrocious for a person who calls himself religious not to believe that ultimately, everything is One in principle. The Soul is the most powerful conceivable thing, for it is eternal and actual, and it will overcome all obstacles to realize the state of perfect fulfillment (God), in the end. We have to stop sinning and grow up: it's our Buddha nature. Our job as the Soul is to come to the ultimate realization. This is why faith in God alone cannot buy you eternal bliss. The ultimate realization is the Law of God, which Jesus states clearly in Mark 12:31. It's not enough to love God, you must love everyone as much as you love yourself to attain to the Ultimate. There must be no ego, no sense of separation. I've never met a Christian who is this way (but to be fair, I haven't met anybody who is this way). Doesn't mean it's not going to happen. It is going to happen: that is my faith. You misinterpret me when I say that we are of the same substance as God. I don't mean that, as parts, we are equivalent to the whole. I merely mean that We are Soul. God is fulfilled, Absolute Soul and the ultimate goal and realization of infinite love. You say that we are not like God, but He disagrees with you (Psalm 82:6) (John 10:34). It's not as hard as you think it is for the Soul to realize Love. All it needs to do is be present and it shall be pure. In the words of a Buddha impersonator (who has, nevertheless, written something beautiful and true), ""If we could see the miracle of a single flower CLEARLY, our whole life would change."" We humans have not fulfilled our potential and made the Realization yet, so we are not God in the sense of being all encompassing, all loving, and completely fulfilled, so it's no surprise that we sin. We cannot ignore the first noble truth: Life is Dukkha. There IS suffering and sin. This is not a reason to hate sinners, nor is it a reason to inflict suffering upon them. Don't fight fire with fire. Sinners are already burning themselves down. They ARE in hell, and yes, they are building bad karma, but they're not going to eternal suffering. We must help them to help themselves up, out of the hole. I know its tough, but it's our job. Love is cleaning poop with a smile. Imagine if mothers didn't change their babies' diapers with a smile, but with contempt and yelling and great reluctance, and therefore sometimes didn't do it at all. I know that poop looks and smells just awful, but unless you clean it with a smile, you're only making things worse for everyone. When we have made the Ultimate Realization, there will be no sin and any sin of the past will be just that, of the past. It'll be like water under the bridge and we will be able to clear our Conscience, forgiving Our Self as the collective for sin that came from ignorance, craving and aversion as individuals. There will be no individuals, no ignorance, craving, nor aversion, nor will there be sin. We'll really put it behind us. God loves you (the Soul, the true Self) more than you can imagine, and He is patient enough for you to realize the timeless Apex of eternity, grow up and take on His legacy of boundless love. My twisted theology is based only off the principle of infinite, patient, boundless love, while you base your correct theology off of arbitrary, corrupt dogmata created by humans motivated by hatred and self-interest. I think I've said enough. Thank you for a very stimulating debate."	PRO	588
S9a809efb-A7f067a25	The Christian God is Real	"First and foremost these are the exact word from 2 peter 1:20 ""Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things."" This is saying that the prophet's themselves are not the interpreter's, but that the Holy Spirit's words are what is written. The reason 2 Peter points this out is because it justifies the bible being the Word of God. However, throughout the Bible in its entirety Jesus speaks in parables to communicate truths of God, and the Bible is filled with metaphors. Take for example, Mark 9:43 which says ""If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out."" God does not mean to literally cut off your hand, and I know this because Jesus did not chop off any body parts of the sinners he encountered (which were many). The topic of homosexuality is always the hardest for me because I myself support gay marriage, so I will address that at the end In the case of Abraham and his son we see two very important things. One is that the love for God should be unconditional, because that is the love he/she has for us. If that means sacrificing your child, then so be it. I know this seems extreme, and it is, but the other truth to this story is important too. God does not WANT that we kill our children for him/her, and God will not MAKE us do anything! He stopped Abraham from killing his son and I do not believe God had anyone make a human sacrifice to him/her, at least not in the Bible that I have read. And in addition, like I just said, God did not make Abraham do anything. We do not have to believe or do or act in anyway we do not want to. we, again, are a thinking people that are given freedom to choose. I do not understand how you disagree with the love your enemies statement. It's a simple don't fight fire with fire methodology. If someone hits me and I hit them back, what do we have? Two people with sore faces and bad attitudes. But if someone hits me and I hug them, two things can happen. One, they could further resist in which case I back away so I don't get punched again! or two, they respond to love with love. God never says it was easy to love your neighbor, but if we continue to perpetuate violence it will never end. Love directly combats hatred. So do not add more hatred to the equation or its counterproductive. Finally, we have the issue of homosexuality. I do not understand the whole ""man shall not lie with man"" argument myself. I thought back many times to Genesis 9;7 where God says ""Now be fruitful, and multiply..."". I thought maybe because gay couples cannot physically conceive a child, God did not want them to marry. {At the time the Bible was written, when you ""lay"" with someone they were your spouse or it became illegal (prostitution and mistresses and what not), or you were royalty of some sort.} However I did relate this to another argument, which is that of slaves. In the Bible, slaves are mentioned frequently because that was a social norm of the times. Jesus did not directly clash with slave owners every time the topic was brought up. So I myself am still seeking truth in how things like homosexuality and slavery appear contradictory to what God's essential messages are, that of love and equality. I know my God is a just and loving one who created everyone equally. The only thing I can say about it is this: God tells us in Matthew 7:1 ""Do not judge lest ye be judged"". I hope that you do not believe Christians are here to judge the world according to our personal moral standards, because God tells us not to judge EVER. I cannot and will not judge anyone of a different sexuality and race, and I will love them the same as anyone just as God tells us we must do."	PRO	589

Jesus said two helpful things about the Holy Spirit. First, that the Holy Spirit's job is to convict (or, convince) people of their sin. Now, that's a very UNcomfortable feeling for those being convicted! (John 16:8) Second, that he would send the Holy Spirit to believers once he'd returned to heaven, and that the Holy Spirit would be our comfortor. He brings a sense of comfort and peace to those he indwells. Provided, of course, that they act on the conviction of sin that he brings! (John 16:12-15) Until the Holy Spirit first convicts us of our sin and we repent as a response, we cannot then go on to experience his comfort and peace! The Christians who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost had all repented and been obedient. That special anointing had visible signs accompanying in order to establish the new, baby Church, and to get the spreading of the gospel message shot out into all the world. If you became a Christian aged 4, you would have had very little grasp of the gospel, let alone any of the above. If you genuinely turned to Jesus with the simple faith of a little child, you undoubtedly would be indwelt with the Holy Spirit back then. The question is, have you matured to Christian adult-hood since then? Or are you trying to be a sort of 'independent' Christian who isn't bothered about the fellowship of the saints and the spiritual body of Christ (the Church)? The Holy Spirit works in our hearts and minds and deals with our consciences. As you awaken to his subtle promptings in those areas, you will become more and more aware of what he is doing in your life. Prayer is an absolutely fundamental aspect of knowing how the Holy Spirit would deal with us. So I hope this encourages you back to basics. And I do sympathise with the cosh effect of your medication. It's horrible. Just make sure that when you are not so badly affected by it, you get close to God in prayer, Bible study and worship. He's with you all the way, whether you are aware of his presence or not. He's promised never to leave us or forsake us. Trust him! [http://answers.yahoo.com...]	PRO	590

I press the review button and I did not have internet connection. I try to get my work back. It is gone. Everything. I guess you should count yourself lucky. I utterly decimated God in that post. I drew the similarities between God and Santa. Everything. Words cannot explain how furious I am... but maybe not posting it was good. For you. There is no way I am writing it again. I did it too perfectly. I even ended with the line, ""It is time to accept the cruel reality, and not live in the idyllic reality that you believed in, and continuously deceive yourself. That reality will be shattered, broken by me."" - a quote by yourself. I am so upset that my mind cannot process the fact that I lost it all. I started with the perfect entry. I gave a link to a song to listen to while you read my argument. This was the link. I thought out every word with so much care. I explained that everything you have said about Santa applies to God. Every flaw you pointed out about Santa is a flaw about God. I said so many cool sounding things. About mirrors. So many things. I'll try to remember my 8 arguments. I'll just tell them in single sentences even though I went into WAY more detail. 1. I think I said that when you told me to ask Santa to destroy the wonders of the world I said why not ask God to destroy the wonders of the world because in the bible he says he will do anything you ask. 2. You said Santa doesn't need children's wish listed because she is omniscient and I said that god doesn't need prayers because she is omniscient. 3. You said Santa should answer 100% of the time not 90% because he is omnipotent and I said God should answer prayers 100% of the time because he is omnipotent but he doesn't so you criticized God. 4. You said that Santa needing to be caught on a mere camera is dumb because he is omniscient and omnipotent so he should be able to prove his existence with something greater such as moving a mountain, and I replied by saying that God should prove his existence better then a mere old book and god should move a mountain to prevent atheists from burning in Hell. 5. Your quote about me admitting that Santa's thinking is flawed because he allows starvation is identical to God because she allows starvation so you are saying that God's thinking is flawed. 6. I think that this one was about the elves and elves have higher technology then humans but the toys are still the same so I said that god supposedly has far superior intelligence but his actions in the bible do not indicate so and I gave a TON of examples but you can probably guess. 7. I forgot. I have no clue what this one was. 8. Your quote was that if Santa is omniscient and omnipotent then why did he need to go to a lab to get tested when he could just give them the knowledge and I said if God is omniscient and omnipotent why does he force people to read a long boring bible to find out about him instead of just giving everyone the knowledge instantly. Then I concluded by giving a long paragraph about how you would feel if everyone in the world except about 2% of people believed in Santa and you didn't understand why and you had to go to Santa's Workshop of Worship every Sunday to write wish lists to Santa and you had to go to Santa classes. That's about it. I also kept going on and on about how all of your arguments against Santa were arguments against God also. I seriously considered just forfeiting after losing everything but I can't. I'll stay to the end even if it mean I won't win now. My main argument to win this though was that since there is the same amount of Evidence for God and Santa which is none, then if Con believes in God then he must also believe in Santa because there is the same amount of evidence to support both. Therefore if he believes in God then he believes in Santa and if he believes in Santa then I win. I am still really upset that the world will never get to see what i wrote. Just remember that the most important lesson on DDO is to copy everything you write and put it on a word document. This isn;t the first time I lost everything. Also check the internet."	PRO	591

My opponent propose that one day it is as if we will have pure cold without heat. How on earth can something be 'good' if there is no 'evil'? Hell cannot function without a person ensuring the punishment of all, to do such an evil task would conflict with God being omnibenevolent. Thus God depends on Satan to carry out such brutal tasks. My opponent is trying to render this entire debate UNDEBATABLE since he said Satan will not exist which is a rather self-destructive argument as then there will be no one to punish the wrong-doers, since if God were to cause eternal suffering he would be evil and hence no omnibenevolent.

Quantum physics is spooky, mysterious stuff. As Victor Stenger says, ""Quantum mechanics is thought, even by many physicists, to be suffused with mysteries and paradoxes. Mystics seize upon these to support their views."" He notes, ""Modern physics, including quantum mechanics, remains completely materialistic and reductionistic while being consistent with all scientific observations. The apparent holistic, nonlocal behavior of quantum phenomena, as exemplified by a particle’s appearing to be in two places at once, can be understood without discarding the commonsense notion of particles following definite paths in space and time or requiring that signals travel faster than the speed of light. No superluminal motion or signalling has ever been observed, in agreement with the limit set by the theory of relativity."" [3] For more information, see the article below. Again, there are many things in science that are spooky, mysterious, difficult to make sense of, or even incomprehensible at the present moment. We should continue to study these things, scientifically. Science works from the assumption that natural phenomenon can be explained by material causes. Any paradox is easy to “solve” if we renounce materialism and resort to supernatural explanations. Lazy quacks would love to give up and say ""God did it."" But remember: many insurmountable mysteries of 100 years ago have genuine, scientific, materialistic, evidence-based explanations today. Instead of throwing in the towel, we should work towards making sense of these mysteries, rationally and scientifically. This means we don’t make arguments from personal incredulity. We don’t argue, “I can’t personally conceive of a materialistic explanation, therefore it’s supernatural.” That argument is fallacious. On Science You seem disappointed that science has not yet answered every possible question about nature. Well, science has only existed for a few hundred years, not ""billions of billions of years"" as you suggest. You are correct that science has been wrong about many things. ""It is important to recognize the fallibility of science and the scientific method. But within this fallability lies its greatest strength: self-correction. Whether a mistake is made honestly or dishonestly, whether a fraud is unknowingly or knowingly perpetrated, in time it will be flushed out of the system by lack of external verification. The cold fusion fiasco is a classic example of the system's swift exposure to error."" [6] ""Faith has no checks and balances, no follow-up investigation to see if an intuition works."" [7] Answers in the Bible You encourage me to ""consult your Bible"" because ""the answers are ALL there."" All the wrong answers, maybe. I don't know about you, but when I look around myself right now, I see: my laptop, coffee maker, speakers, cell phone, smoke alarm, my clothes, my contact lenses, etc. These things are the fruit of science; not the fruit of the spirit. If all we did was ""consult the Bible"", I would have none of these things. The Bible certinaly does not have ALL the answers to scientific questions; it has a few makeshift answers to certain questions, and all of them are more-or-less wrong. My Opinion on God I agree with Michael Shermer when he says, ""I do not know that there is no God, but I do not believe in God, and have good reasons to think that the concept of God is socially and psychologically constructed."" Unlike Victor Stenger and Richard Dawkins, I do not believe that the existence of God is a scientific issue. As Robert Carroll points out, ""What scientific knowledge or empirical test could falsify the concept of an eternal non-physical consciousness with the power to create things out of nothing? [...] Claiming that the existence of gods and spirits are scientific matters opens the door and invites every variety of superstition into the science arena. They don't belong in the arena. They belong in the parking lot."" [5] SOURCES [1] Malcolm W. Browne, Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org...;) [2] Far Apart, 2 Particles Respond Faster Than Light, by Malcolm W.

S6d66188-A2719f146	where are the real republicans	"The Republican Party was started by a coalition of Whigs, Northern Democrats, and Free Soilers. Lincoln's previous Whig affiliation fit very well with the early Republican Party. The Republicans were very Clayite in the beginning and looked to implement the ""American System"" laid out by Henry Clay. The Republicans were by and large NOT abolitionists, but rather just wanted to keep slavery where it was already. This was not out of some love for the slaves, but rather because they would ""take away white men's jobs"" if they were allowed to move west. Lincoln, in particular, opposed slavery because he believed it increased the birth rates of those with African heritage and he wanted to see them wiped from American land. That is why he also supported things like deportation of all African-Americans back to Africa. Lincoln, however, supported a Constitutional Amendment, known as the Corwin Amendment, which would have forever barred any federal ""interferences"" on the institution of slavery in the South. He was not an abolitionist and did not care about the slaves. The Republican Party was and is no less racist than the Democrats. Immigration is not a federal issue because the federal government is not explicitly given the power to regulate immigration in the Constitution, and thus the 10th Amendment leaves it to the States and to the People. Just the existence of a federal bureaucracy like the INS does not mean it is a federal issue. The fact that it exists does not change the Constitution. Do you argue that education is a federal issue simply because the Department of Education exists? Should healthcare be a federal issue, considering that we have a Department of Health and Human Services? Things they don't truly stand for? According to who? You? Do you make the Republican Party platform? Do you control all the Republican politicians? Point to specifics. Tell me what the Republican Party apparently does not support that I said they did. Free trade is a different issue. If you want to debate on that, I suggest a new debate so as to not clog this one. All I was arguing was that despite what many Republicans claim, they - as a whole - support protectionism in trade. The debate on China and foreign policy in general also is a different issue. I am just stating what the Republican Party supports currently and how it is similar to the early Republican stances. As to what a ""real Republican"" would do in response to the ""threats"" we face, I agree with you. And I think that is what they are doing. Two nations have been invaded and we are gearing up for a third (Iran) while greasing the wheels for a fourth (Syria). The tough-guy rhetoric is common among modern day Republicans and that was my point about militarism. Lincoln and the early Republicans were militarists as well. Thus, the Republican Party has not ""lost its way"" but rather has followed the traditions of Lincoln and rejected the Robert Taft/Ron Paul types."	CON	597
S33b32f5f-Aa4bebee6	Is God real and is the Bible accurate	"""how can a living organism come from nonliving things."" Scientists disagree on this and i really don't think about it that much. You say not to answer without actual knowledge of what i'm saying. But i'll still answer it the best i can. I don't know that's my answer. I don't know how life came from non-living things, but there is no evidence that points to the answer to this question being ""God did it"". If you do have proof of this i would love to hear it. You didn't talk about the bible but i know you will later in the debate so i'll talk about that: The bible is a book that has a ""Old Testament"" and a ""New Testament"". Together this book was written over the course of about 1,500 years by a lot of different people with different views. Example: Genesis 1 and 2 state different things. Was Adam created first or vegetation? Depending on which type of Christianity you believe in you may not even think the Old testament was real. I think that's weird because Jesus talks about it in the New Testament and even supports it. Now the whole ""the bible is accurate"" thing. Simply put...No, it's not accurate. The bible says that bats are birds and not mammals. Exodus 21:12 states: Anyone who strikes a man and kills him shall surely be put to death. When Romans 12:17 states: Do not repay any one evil for evil. Genesis 3:14 states: So the Lord God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, ... You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust"" when snakes don't eat dust of dirt as some say. The bible is full of things like this. And above all of that, the bible has been re-written hundreds of times and by now there is no way of knowing which one is the right one. This is the reason the bible is not a credible source for really anything. And if Atheists for some reason had a book that supported mass-murders, rape, slavery, child abuse and killing, Christians would say terrible things about said book and the people that support it. As they should. The bible is terrible and the only reason people still support it is because people say that the bad things in the bible weren't meant to be taken literally. (even though the bible says in 2nd Peter 1:20-21: But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.)

S3b65c6e5-Aad9fe113	The Bible should not be used as proof in a God is real/fake debate.	"First I would like to thank you Sheldor, for accepting the challenge, I look forward to debating with you. My argument will be based on the fact that, in the Bible, there is no solid testable ways to prove the existence of a Christian god. For example ""God is real because the Bible says so"". Using this logic, the same thing could go for someone trying to prove the existence of the Muslim god, or any other being for that matter. ""Allah is real because the Koran says so"" ""Legolas is real because the Two Towers says so"". So unless someone (sheldor) could find a testable theory or already known facts that point to the existence of God, then it is essentially useless."	PRO	599
S5d54af1e-Ade4ad8e8	God is real, and watching over us.	Thank you very much for accepting my debate. Now, to the beliefs of Christians, Earth is the only inhabited planet. So if Earth is the only planet with life beings, why would God make our universe such as it is? Our universe is so expansive, by the time in several millions of years when Earth reaches so close to the sun it burns up (a scientifically confirmed fact), we will barely know what is in our universe, let alone traverse it. Why didn't God just create our galaxy and be finished? Certainly none of us will make it outside this universe. Also, if God were real and despised gays, why would he create them? Why would righteous people like Martin Luther King Jr. be killed? Why would God create cancer and other fatal illnesses to plague those who have done no harm? I dare you, opponent, to ask me one of the questions other atheists supposedly can't think of an answer for, and I will answer them as good a question as any other.	CON	600
Sa4352af2-Ac848d05e	The God of Classic theism is real	"I am new at this form of debating(online debating). If my form isn't correct I'm sorry. I will be using the Bible as my basis of argument, so my case will be built around the Bible(New International Version). If my opponent disproves, please don't accept this debate. John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2)He was with God in the beginning. (3)Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. (4)In him was life, and that life was the light of men. (5)The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. This clearly defines the existence of God. Throughout the Gospel, Jesus clearly explained that many people would not accept the truth. This has proven timeless to date. Many people have chosen not to believe. God allowed human beings to have a free will. In the Bible, God indicated that he was not willing that any should perish, but that all should have eternal life. He also indicates that He knows many will reject the truth of His existence, but he clearly exists. Contention 1: If God does not exist, then who created us all? If the God of Classic theism isn't real then the their option is Evolution. The only basis to Evolution is (with all due respect) the incorrect assumptions of Charles Darwin and scientists who have no more knowledge than he did. Contention 2: God is God Revelation 22:12-13 ""Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Genesis 5:1-2 This is the written account of Adam's line when God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. (2) He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them ""man."" And one more: Deuteronomy 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.

S7908009f-A1bf5a172	God is Real, Evolution isn't	"To start off, people have their own beliefs, but we cannot stupidly deny one belief in favor of another, especially when the former belief has more credibility. Some people are actually foolish enough to believe that there is someone bigger and more powerful than them; that someone can create the world with only using their mouth. As most people know, this is physically impossible. The Earth was not created from the mouth of a deity, but rather, a swirling nebula of dust and rocks. I find it strange how Christianity ridicules other religions, but never looks in at itself to find how ridiculous it is. We are not better than other religions. Every religion sounds crazy when you look at it from an outside perspective. Hindu religions believe that there's a seven armed guy, we think that there's a big floating guy with a beard. None of it makes sense, and we must understand that religions, whether true or not, are all things which we, as people, invented in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable in an empty universe. They are, at best, simple moral guidelines, but we should not actually believe that a giant person made a woman out of a guy's ribs, or anything like that. The bible was written two thousand years ago, and we don't even know the author. How can we consider this a reliable source? Science does not wish to entirely replace religion as an accepted foundation. Rather, it wishes to further clear up the mysteries of life, more logically than religion ever could. We do not have any evidence for the existence of Noah's ark, but we do have evidence for the cosmic background radiation left over from the big bang. https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov... We may never discover what dark matter is, or whether there are other universes, or what came before the big bang, but it doesn't really matter. We shouldn't be focusing on finding the true meaning of life, because we all die eventually, and we'll find things out once we get there. In the meantime, science provides a logical order to things. Humanity is reluctant to move away from something it has known for so long. The scientific revolution only began within the last few centuries, religion has been going on for millennia. However, by accepting science, we can become even more enlightened. There is one absolute truth, more than not, and once we find it, we will know everything. Until then, we should chillax. Here are the answers to your questions: 1. Evolution has not ""stopped"" for the apes, undoubtedly, they are still evolving, although they probably won't become like us for a couple hundred thousand years. You have to understand, humans have evolved over three million years, so we have to be patient until another life form becomes intelligent. You can't instantly wave a magic wand and turn something into something smarter. And, just so you know, apes are not part of OUR evolutionary chain at all, they have evolved over an entirely SEPARATE evolutionary chain from one common ancestor. You have to understand, if you went back to prehistoric times, before Austrolopithicus Afarensis, you would discover apes that would look remarkably different from the ones today. WE have evolved, and apes have evolved. We didn't evolve from them, we evolved with them. 2. Apes don't turn into humans because they are different from humans (see above) 3. No part of bird anatomy is useless, they all help in flight some way or another. If you provided a link to this ""useless anatomy"" I might be able to figure it out, but, to my knowledge, birds aren't even related to human evolution, so why bother with this question at all? 4. Someone did not create the galaxy. Galaxies form over a long time. Our galaxy, the milky way, was probably formed over an unimaginably long epoch. Why do galaxies have to be created? They form because the matter within them is attracted by gravity. This question shows your ignorance, because you assume that something has to be created by a living being. this is remarkably egotistical, and shows how biased we are as a race. We don't think of gravity as being real. Are you one of those flat Earth guys too? 5. Finally, your last question fills be with despair and lowers my faith in humanity, because you don't even know what the big bang is. The big bang was not caused by two meteors crashing, because before the big bang, there was no matter. You talk about these ""meteors"" in the same way the ancient Mayans might mention a turtle god. You assume that everything is episodic and easy to describe, just like in the bible. You cannot comprehend a time when the universe did not exist. This, in my opinion, is a striking example of what religion can do to the human mind. You must not have cared about anything in school, so your conception of the universe is badly warped. The big bang was not caused by meteors crashing, it was the sudden expansion of the universe we know today. People who don't believe in God would say it's a book and no proof, and they would be absolutely correct. There is no proof that some deity exists, and if he wanted us to believe, he should send us some sign. Don't you think? Just opening up the clouds and talking to us, something. Unless he does that, people just won't believe. There is no tangible evidence, and you have to admit that. It is undeniable. You say that the book can give us proof. That's not how proof works. Proof must be brought from outside sources. I could tell people that cows were aliens, and I could say that as much as I wanted, but until a study proved that cows were aliens, my claim would be false. The bible does not serve as a reliable form of evidence, because it was written by people who were enthralled by religion. And you have to admit, religion has caused many problems in the world. the schism between Catholics and Orthodox in Ancient Europe, the conflicts between Islam and Christianity, reflected in the brutality of the crusades, the persecution of Jewish people by Hitler... Think about it. If nobody had any religion, then none of that would have happened. Might I add that in Ancient Rome, Christianity was frowned upon. Jesus was a wanted criminal. My point, above all, is that while religion may or may not be real, science has much more going for it. We don't have the rib of Adam or a snapshot of the parting of the red sea, but we do have the skeletons of cavemen and tiny cells that swim around on a microscope. The greatest tool we have, however, is our brain, which allows us to see past accepted truths and observe our own truth. That's what Galileo, Benjamin Franklin, and Einstein all did, and the world is better because of them. darwin is among the best, because he refused to believe that man was created from dust and, instead, observed the biological similarities between mankind and monkeys. And today, his theory is more accepted than all the Sunday School gossip combined. Thank gosh we finally know where we came from, after three million long years. I await your next argument, sir."

If you created heaven and hell why would it even be a question as to where your child would go. You're correct in that I never specified which ""God"" we are referring to but it was implied by myself and mostly everyone else that we are talking about the character of the god of the bible. Knowing the definitions used to define god by mostly everyone. (All Knowing, Omnipotent, All Powerful, Pure. Holy,) I can assume that my alternative scenario is infinitely better in every aspect in relation to the commonly described character of God. I don't see how testing the motives of his creation and allowing them to carry through life with unverified knowledge in hopes that they make the right decision is the best option for anyone. No parent would be fine with not giving their child the necessary tools to go out into the world on their own in hopes that they will ultimately make the right decision. It doesn't sound at all beneficial to anyone especially considering that the trials and tribulations of this world as well as most of the decisions we make on earth are irrelevant once in heaven. There will be nothing but purity in heaven and no free will that doesn't align with God. I don't see how earning heaven by struggling on earth and then living a boring monotonous eternity solves anything for anyone, why not skip the heartache and make life happy for everyone like any good person would. I may never be able to affirm the motives of God but I can definitely think of many other ways someone who holds the description of a Benevolent, all powerful, all knowing, Father God would handle his creation. Even after causing a flood and having a second chance to reform the world and create a better existence for humanity that would also be pleasing in his sight.

Se8b34212-Ab5e1849	God, heaven, and hell only exist metaphysically, not physically. Therefore, are only ideas.	"You are still overlooking everything I said about subjectivity. Yes! What if we cant prove this, what if we cant prove that. That's when we must act on impassion and emotion to answer the question. I believe we are using subjectivity to give us the validity that you are there, we are debating etc. If we cannot prove anything, we must be subjective about it. I'm not saying I do not believe in intelligent design, I'm saying I do not believe in intelligent design by god because both you and I know all the inconsistencies that have been covered in every other god ebate. No. I did not overlook what you said about subjectivity. I stated clearly that I totally disagree with what you said. Certainly I can point to things in my life which have completely convinced me that God does exist. But those things were subjective. While they offered undeniable proof to me they would in no way shape or form would be proof to you. I totally disagree that if we cannot answer the question ""we must act on impassion (sic) and emotion"" to answer it. That completely rules out logic and reasoning. As I pointed out that just because something does not exist physically, and no one can point to it, does not mean it cannot exist except as an idea. Many atheists are fond of bringing up unicorns and comparing them to God. Unicorns are, of course, physical beings rather than the supernatural being that people believe God to be. To be called a ""unicorn"" they must have the physical characteristics of a unicorn. If it had the horn AND wings it would not be a unicorn. But even there there is no way of saying for certain that unicorns have not existed here in the past, that they may well exist here and now hidden in a lost valley, or they exist in abundance on another planet. You are saying that the fact that something cannot be proved to physically exist means that it only exists as an idea. As I pointed out this is completely incorrect as something can exist without me knowing about it... such as the unicorn on a different planet. The exact same holds true for God. Your point about inconsistencies should be totally ignored by judges as you are bringing them up in the fourth round rather than the second. And no, I do not know what you are talking about when you refer to them. You likewise present them as an established fact (""because you and I both know..."") without any evidence. That would be a different debate. But if I don't exist, why or how are you debating me? The thing is you're still debating me, therefore I still retain value in your mind, so I exist as a subjective idea. I've come to the realization the true meaning of this debate is not regarding metaphysics. It simply comes down to this: We cannot prove god rationally, because god has no OBJECTIVITY. The truth about god can only be answered with SUBJECTIVITY. EVERTHING IS SUBJECTIVE.e I disagree. The only way that God can be proved IS rationally because as you said He has no objectivity. The contradictory statement made by so many atheists is that they want physical ""proof"" of a non-physical being. Sorry, but that is illogical. But as I said the fact that His existence cannot be proved does not mean He cannot exist or exists only as an idea. The fact is that you cannot prove to me that you are actually debating me or that you exist. You could very well be a dream, and when I wake up I will see reality for what it is. In my mind anyone who has watched the movie ""Matrix"" should understand that possibility. Deductive reasoning is the path to truth when subjective reality leave us hanging. Let me ask you a question, ""Why should we love mankind if this may all be a dream and they mean nothing?"" You're just contradicting yourself. This ""deep"" love you speak of, I've never felt it, so how does it exist? The evidence you are simply providing only affects you and not me. It's like when somebody says "" Oh yes, I always feel that god is with me everywhere I go."" That's you, not me. You are getting into the whole purpose issue which, trust me, you don't want to approach right now... if you think I am long-winded now wait until you see me on that subject. Suffice it to say that I fully believe that life does have a profound meaning and purpose, but that meaning and purpose are non-existent without God. And yes, that is subjective. You said: ""This ""deep"" love you speak of, I've never felt it, so how does it exist?"". You are still arguing that the only reality is what you have experienced. It is as if you are trapped in your inexperienced 16 year old body. You do not see what is real beyond your own senses. But the fatal flaw you are making is that reality exists whether you are aware of it or not. I'm sorry if this sounds patronizing, I am not trying to be, but you are 16, I am 65. Which of the two of us do you think has had more life experiences? The point I am trying to make is that because you have not had an experience so far does not mean you will not in the future. A typical sixteen year old is often too wrapped up in his/her own life to be concerned about the lives of others. Often they may feel sad for a moment about the starving kids in Africa, but they will not let that affect their going to the mall with their friends. But guess what? That could very well change as they gain more maturity. Eventually they do see the big picture. My first encounter with this love was when I was a 19 year old atheist taking a rest while mowing the lawn, and looking at a blade of grass idlely. I cannot explain it but I was simply completely overwhelmed looking at its order and symmetry, an order that I then sensed all around me, and then felt His complete overwhelming presence. When I read your question the first thing that popped into my mind was a lyric from a John Denver song (""Spring""?)... ""A part of everything is here in me."" Probably not your style but you should listen to it: http://www.youtube.com.... When you can quiet yourself and then open your mind to realize that you are one with every living thing, every person, whether they be of this world or not you will sense the oneness which is He. And yes that will be a completely subjective experience, but universally true nonetheless. So yes, it could very well be that one could ""feel that God is with me everywhere I go."" I cannot help but feel that now. TRUTH IS SUBJECTIVE, which makes it definitive to you or I. You cannot determine if my definition of reality is reality, so you are forced to draw conclusions SUBJECTIVELY. Absolutely not. We may not know the truth and we may have completely different ideas of what the truth is. But no matter what I think the truth is does not change what the truth actually is, and with most things there can be only ONE truth. I'm not saying that rationality cannot deduce anything, this would be absurd. But Rationality is limited when it comes to the god debate, due to the fact that there is no objectivity. What I'm saying is Science and rationality have no consideration for ultimate purposes. Nietzsche said this in ""Human, All Too Human."" I would agree that that science has no consideration for ultimate purposes but that simply means that it is limited. Science is the study of the physical universe. It cannot hope to discover what lies beyond. It can point to the possibility of other dimensions but it will never be able to describe them because they would fall into the category of supernatural rather than natural. Rationality however can take us anywhere we want to go. Deductive reasoning is what led me from the atheist looking at a blade of grass to a theist believing that God exists, to a deist believing that God was in some way responsible for creation, to a non-denominational Christian seeing the truth in Christ message but not being a part of any church, to Roman Catholic where I see the greatest amount of what to me rings true. My beliefs are certainly subjective. But that does not change the fact that there is a REAL truth that does exist and is not an idea. Very good point. Every invention does start as an idea does it not? The inventors want this idea to exist, so they make it exist. THIS IS SUBJECTIVE, and the same could be said about god. Again, god can be proved subjectively, not rationally. I would like to point out that ""proof of God"" was not the issue of the debate. It was whether or not something non-physical can exist as more than a mere idea. I think I have fully explained that it can. In as far as your inventor, once his invention exists it is no longer a mere idea; it has a reality of its own and is no longer subjective. If another inventor had created the exact same thing before he had his idea, his idea does not change the reality of the object existing already. You still seem to be missing my point that because someone has his/her own thoughts or ideas of what reality is does not change what reality actually is. God can exist no matter what you or I think about His reality. More and more evidence seems to be piling up that points to His existence. Just as with science just because no one has yet discovered the ""missing link"" does not necessarily prove evolution false. It simply means we can't yet see the big picture; we don't yet have the full truth. The exact same thing is true with God. The fact that we do not have all the pieces to the puzzle and cannot point to a completed picture does not mean He exists only as an idea. Like you said in the previous sentence, ideas could be incorrect. The real truth is subjective, not objective. Sorry, but you are totally wrong. The real truth has nothing to do with what we imagine the truth to be. No matter what our ideas are the real truth exists despite them. God can exist as real no matter what I, you or anyone else thinks about it. Thank you for this debate.... I enjoyed it thoroughly. Good luck to you in your life's search for answers."	CON	611

Sfd336fc2-A1aae9e88	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	Welcome, Daley, and good luck. The purpose of this debate was that the Christian god should have made better choices in order to fulfill his own goals that are determined by his loving, just character. I have clearly stated that in creating Man, I believe (based on my Catholic education) that the Christian god's ultimate intention was that someone would become conscious of his infinite glory and that someone would be able to share in it (as in, become divine and loving and just and creative and all-seeing just like him) and ultimately attain oneness with him. If you disagree that this was the original intention of the Christian god, then my argument will not work. So, we are discussing a different path, a different plan for what is still in essence the Christian god. Since he'd be doing things differently according to my model, he would no longer be well described by the Bible, and since he never would have personally condemned anybody, he would not have needed to sacrifice his son, Jesus Christ. I would like to point out that my view even of the Christian god is that we must all ultimately be sons and daughters of him, just like Jesus, but perhaps less mature. I see Jesus as the son of the Christian god that has most fulfilled God's purpose for Man (because Jesus has attained divinity and oneness with God). Anyway, the point is that in this model God would need no sacrifice and at most would have sent Jesus as a spiritual and moral teacher. In short, God would still be the Christian god, but he would have done almost everything differently, so you might say that his Holy Will must be different from the god of the Bible, so technically you could argue that the god I speak of must be somewhat different. From now on, God is defined as an omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omnipresent personal deity whose ultimate purpose for man was that man would attain full consciousness of and oneness with the divinity of God. Therefore, he may (or may not) come off as being closer to a different god than the one in the Bible. The subtle differences in the Samsaric models across religions are very complex and largely irrelevant to my argument. I am most familiar with the Buddhist model of Samsara, however. I want to explain how the basic ideas behind Samsara are better than the basic ideas behind Heaven and Hell, so I will define Samsara rather simply. The attributes of Samsaric existence are: 1) Souls are not defined as the essence of any one person in particular, because they are reincarnated. My soul cannot be the essence of me that sets me apart from everyone else, because that same soul goes into another being. So a soul is defined as the fundamental inner subjectivity of all beings that is recycled and connected to all other souls. This soul is made of exactly the same immaterial substance as God. 2) The law of Karma is one of the most important attributes of Samsaric existence that states that the actions of any soul are the primary determinants of the nature of its future incarnations/existence. In this case, the closer you are in character to God, the more bliss-filled your existence becomes and the more powerful and free you become. If you do bad things that are against the character of God, the more full of suffering and impermanence and helplessness your existence can become. Note well that since nobody does infinite actions, no soul can reach full divinity or full severance from divinity by accumulating Karma, but that does not mean that a soul cannot rejoin God. In order to do that, a soul must stop accumulating Karma altogether and lose its personal existence (and therefore become full of, and one with God). As long as you create, so do you continue to be created. Therefore God, here, only created instances of inner subjectivity that create their own existences until they decide to stop creating anything and again become one with the all-encompassing subjectivity of God. Because only individual, created souls accumulate karma and create their personal existence, it stands to reason that God does not create Karma: he does not interfere in Samsara after creating it. Samsara is like a machine that helps God to actualize (fulfill the purpose of) his souls because if he did worldly Samsaric things himself he would limit his all-encompassing-ness. God does not act within Samsara because the entirety of Samsara is within him (as all of his creations are: if it comes from God, it emanates, or unfolds from him). Anyway, on to explaining why creating Samsara is more prudent for God (as defined above) to create than Heaven or Hell. Samsara is so effective at teaching moral perfection because beings are directly creating their own realities through their actions. What this means is that any being can choose to remain forever separated from God through his own actions, but as soon as he grows weary of this separation he will seek God's law through the guidance of Jesus and any other possible actualized souls (who share the character of Jesus) and through his own inner light that is his esssence and never dies. When, through experience, the soul has fully understood God's law of put good (as defined by God's essential loving character) in, get good out and vice versa, he will be able to understand that if he stops acting in his personal interests at all but speaks for the collective (like Jesus) then he can attain oneness with God (and full realization and sharing of His greatness). Heaven and Hell could never hope to accomplish what Samsara does. People fail to act according to God's law almost all the time because we're too immature. As individuals, we identify with the personal self and not the collective, eternal Self of God (all-encompassing subjectivity) and we treat others badly and are motivated by personal gain. One life is by definition, not enough to stop identifying with the personal self, because only one personal self has been experienced. How is anyone supposed to deny the self if it is all they know? I'm not saying it's impossible, just unreasonably difficult. One life is not enough to realize God's law which is a deep love and compassion for all beings. By sending people to hell, God has created the experience of eternal suffering, which is the antithesis of his Goal that we agreed on when you accepted my opening statement. God didn't create beings so that eternal suffering would be known, but so that Love could become known by someone who was previously ignorant. Forgiving mere believers in Christ and rewarding them with eternal bliss is just as pointless if we keep the Goal in mind. The only way that Love can be authentically realized is through personal experience and free choice. If someone has not realized the ultimate by themselves, then they have not realized the ultimate at all, and they need to realize themselves before entering the meaningless perfection of eternal bliss (because we find meaning in life only through overcoming suffering). In conclusion, sending people to Heaven and Hell leads to no definite self-realization of God's love and of God's laws. I argue that eventually, everyone must come to this realization themselves, because that is the purpose of their Soul (subjectivity, inner light), and the only way for the Soul to do that is to keep returning to worldly, karmic, imperfect existence until the individual can transcend his individuality and truly relate to God and enter His perfection in the most natural, organic, and righteous manner possible.

Sae461600-Ab70146db	God is real	I understand that to you, There is no evidence of God. However, If you look around the universe you can see how every single little detail is perfectly made. For instance, If the sun was 3 feet closer to us, We would all burn to a crisp, If it were just 3 feet away, We would all turn into instant icicles. Our DNA and genetic codes are all perfect. Everything on the earth points to the fact that there is a creator. Now many atheist wonder how God exists. If everything must have a creator wouldn't the creator had to have been created? The answer is No. Let me explain this to y'all. The universe is made up into four components. Matter, Time, Space, And Energy. They are all manifestations of eachother meaning they all coincide with one another and rely on each other. Without space, We couldn't have matter. Without Matter we couldn't have energy and so on and so forth. The universe is bound by these four components. We are all made of matter, We all need energy to survive, We need space to be able to exist, And we are also bound by time, Meaning we must be born and we must also die. Imagine you are baking a cake. The cake needs flour, Sugar, Water, Oil, And eggs. Without these five components a cake would not be a cake. The cake NEEDS these 5 components to exist. However, Do you need flour and water and eggs to exist? No! Because you're not a cake. You are not bound by these components because you are the creator of the cake! You see God created the universe. He created Matter, Time, Space, And energy. He doesn't need space and energy to survive because he created space and energy. He isn't bound by time so he has always existed and will always exist. He doesn't have to have a physical form because he is not bound by matter. It is really hard for a human to wrap their minds around God's omnipotent existence because the four components he created that we are bound by is all we've ever known. The fact the we have a creator who perfectly placed us and everything around us is way more plausible than everything magically happening by a giant explosion. Just to add to the debate, I believe in God because I've seen his miracles. I knew a woman who had cancer tumors in her lungs. Hundreds of churches prayed for her and the cancer completely disappeared. She hadn't even started treatment. As a waitress I remember my rent being due on Tuesday. I went to work on Monday 300 dollars short. I begged God for a miracle. I went home with $300 that night. I've seen so many prayers answered there is no doubt in mind that there is a God up there answering them. He loves you and he wants to change your life. You don't have to understand everything, You just have to have a tiny bit of faith. In the Bible it says that the faith of a mustard seed can move mountains. He will reveal himself to you, But you must first take a step of faith. I promise you won't regret it! ***I typed really fast, Please so your best to look over spelling and grammar errors!	PRO	614

The Earth is 95 million miles give or take from the sun. A tiny fraction of this is millions of miles. You'll find no credible scientist that disagrees. Your link does not. Mutations are humanity's fault? Can you edit your own personal genes to assure your children won't have genetic defects? The defective rate amongst christians is also the same as other religions and the same as nonbelievers. You have no evidence to support the statement ""Our DNA was once perfect and flawless. "" All of science shows we have more humble origins. Please cite your evidence for this claim. Our eyes function horribly in comparison to the eyes of just about any bird. Our nose would be seen as a horrifying defect for any dog. Cats and bats laugh at our inability to see things in the dark as well as how poorly we hear. You have no points in your favor here. Evolution doesn't guarantee that our DNA magically always gets better. Mutations occur. The mutations that make us worse off will typically die more often than the mutations that make us better off. There are hundreds of thousands of years and many deaths through many generations and many horrifying mutations before humanity gets improvements. Your speculative opinion when you don't clearly understand what evolution is and the evidence for it is not evidence that disproves evolution. Do you think God faked all the fossils and skeletons we find that show mutations over time? There's no room in this argument for me to explain the four fundamental forces of nature, (Gravity, Electromagnetism, Strong and Weak nuclear forces) and I may not even be qualified to, But saying Time, Energy/Matter, And Space are fundamental forces or 'components' is extremely naive, And at best an oversimplification. To speculate that your one christian scientist holds all the definitive answers to the universe when no physicist would make the claim that we understand completely how the universe works is also a false claim. Neither you or I are qualified in a physics conversation, And it shows. ""God is not bound by matter"" You have no evidence to support this claim besides the Bible. You can't use the Bible to prove the Bible is true. I can write a book that confirms that it is true and write anything I want in it. ""Every human on this planet will receive one death. This is due to the fact we are bound by time. "" Medical science is advancing. It won't be all that long before we can sustain our lives permanently, Barring extreme injury or disease, And even those may be cured with time. There is nothing that makes us think otherwise. The human body dies due to degeneration rather than any death-bond with time. There's nothing specific about time that makes us die. It is the human body's inability to repair itself. People who die of ""old age"" aren't dying because they are old. It is typically organ failure, Lessening ability to fight off diseases, Et cetera. Time is not the cause of death. There is no reason to believe we will not be able to repair our bodies. The ability to live forever doesn't mean we're defying Time. It is our bodies that we are in war with. It makes no sense to say we die due to being ""bound by time. "" ""God is not bound by time. "" You have no evidence for this statement. ""God is very powerful"" is a perfectly fine statement. Doesn't prove his existence, But it is NOT omnipotence. Believing in omnipotence is simply illogical. You can't refute the statement I used to disprove it. You can say he is powerful but there is a number to it, However large. There is a limit. ""You seem very unsure about everything. By there being so many theories just further proves that sceintists have absolutely no clue. Everything on this Earth points to a creator. "" I am unsure about everything because I have insufficient evidence to prove one way or another. There are many theories, But they are all based on facts that we have 'proven. ' Scientists have plenty of clues. That doesn't mean we can definitively say what is true. My problem is you are NOT unsure. You claim to know all of this. You do not. No one does. A creator is a possible solution, No one denies this. You have no evidence to prove that it IS the solution. All you have done to prove your stance is say ""Have a bit of faith. "" While simultaneously saying ""you are incapable of faith. "" It is curious isn't it, That your God would create so many humans who don't value faith at all while simultaneously requiring them to have faith to reveal himself to them. It is curious that he made me, Supposedly, With absolutely no means of ever learning of him, Isn't it? If the inability to believe something with no evidence sends me to eternal punishment, Then it will have been God's own fault that I face eternal torment. You can't explain to me why he would do this. It is abhorrent. If he exists and requires faith to reveal himself and requires belief in him to avoid eternal damnation and he creates beings who put no value on faith he has doomed all of us before we exited our mother's wombs. This would make him immoral. I can't take your miracle remission scenario on faith alone. It seems if this story were true and it were actually a miracle it would have been confirmed and your churches would be publishing all the documentation of this case for everyone to see. It would convert many people and save them from eternal damnation. Why do you think your churches do not do so? If they do, By all means give me a link. You may well convince me to be Christian. All I really need is a bit of evidence. This is all atheists have ever asked for. If an explanation was given, Hopefully you don't wave the explanation away saying medical doctors have no idea what they're talking about. There's a reason you go to the hospital instead of praying when you are having a stroke or heart attack. If God can answer your prayers by not answering your prayers then there really is no evidence that would make you reconsider your position. I just hope you think of all the Christian women that prayed hard to not get raped and murdered where God answered their prayers by allowing their rapists and murderers to do what they will. Some rapists and murderers never being caught. If you think their prayers were sufficiently answered there is really not much I can say to dissuade you. God is perfect because you have defined him to be so, Not because reality shows it to be so. Maybe there is a 50th dimension chess going on here where allowing the rape of women, The starvation of children, And endless suffering around the world to go on is 'good. ' Maybe there is an argument for this. This is why God has explaining to do, Were he to exist. Until a sufficient argument is given to me, I cannot believe a good entity watches over us. Hopefully you understand the point of view. Do you think women who were murdered are stronger for it? People who contract MRSA infections? My wife will never run again. Is she stronger for it? She loved being able to move normally. Do you think children who are stumped due to malnutrition who eventually die of starvation are stronger for it? For all either of us knows, Maybe they are! Again, God would need to explain this to me. You have no argument to prove it is so. You are operating on faith and guesses. As we stated earlier, I have no faith. I was born with none. I value reality. I value saving women from being raped. I value feeding starving children. I value eliminating degeneration and disease. I value reducing human suffering. Nothing shows me your God values the same things. Why would I value him, Even if he did exist? He does not save women from fires. May your thoughts be clear, -Thoht"	CON	621

However, Our DNA was once perfect and flawless. What I was trying to argue was that we all have a pattern. We all have 2 eyes, 2 ears, One nose, Etc.

If you think about it, Our universe IS bound by the four components (matter, Time, Space, And energy) Now I don't have a link to share with you because I got this idea from a very well educated, Christian scientist at a lecture of his. I received my degree from a Christian college and I also studied physics. ""You are comparing the creation of the universe to the cooking of a cake. Where did I get the ingredients for the cake from? The outside world. I didn't poof them into existence from nothing. Where did God get the ingredients for the universe? "" I am a human who is bound by matter. This means I must have matter in order to create matter. God is not bound by matter. The Bible says that when he made the universe he merely spoke it into existence. You see, He isn't bound by matter because he created it. That is how powerful my God is. ""Your position is that you know exactly what happened. That God necessarily existed prior to the creation of the universe. It doesn't hold water. From whence did God come? "" I never claimed to know exactly what happened. Nobody knows. I do, However, Believe the Christian Bible which gives me a pretty good idea. There may even be more to it than that. I just know when I received salvation, I began to just trust God. I didn't understand exactly what or who God was but I felt his presence. That was really all I needed. Every human on this planet had a beginning. Furthermore, Every human on this planet will receive one death. This is due to the fact we are bound by time. It is very hard for us to comprehend the fact that God has always existed because all we know is everything must have a beginning. However God is not bound by time because God created time. ""God is not omnipotent. There is always a limit. Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnibenevolence, None of these traits are possibilities. "" God is very powerful. He is the creator of the universe. You say it is not possible for something to be omnipotent because you are a human without the slightest amount of faith. I am not intending any disrespect whatsoever. However if you were to take the smallest leap of faith and trust God, He will reveal himself to you. I remember a story in the Bible where a woman had a deadly ailment. Jesus came through her town and there was a crowd of people following him. She did her best to fight through the crowd to get to Jesus. She finally was able to reach the end of his garment and touched it. She was instantly healed. All you have to do is just grab on to Jesus, Just a little. You just have to have a small amount of faith. It will change your life. ""The Big Bang did not create the universe. This is a point people don't seem to understand. There was something before the Big Bang. We aren't entirely sure what it was. There are plenty of theories. "" I wish you would have elaborated more on this so I know what to research. I LOVE researching things about how the Earth's was created. However, You seem very unsure about everything. By there being so many theories just further proves that scientist have absolutely no clue. Everything on this Earth points to a creator. ""Remission is an understood phenomena. We have immune systems"" I understand that this may happen on occasion. What I was trying to explain was that she went to the doctor and was told that she had a tumor the size of a baseball in her lungs. 3 weeks later after hundreds of churches were praying for her, The doctors were astonished that the tumor had completely disappeared without treatment. A tumor that size just evaporating in that short amount of time is nothing short of a miracle. ""Believe it or not, Religious people have the same rates of remission than non religious people. "" I am not going to argue with you on this because the Bible says God rains on the just as well as the unjust. However, Seeing prayers answered definitely breeds faith. Once a small seed of faith is planted God can change a person's life. ""How many times have you prayed and not got what you wanted or needed? "" I have prayed many times. God has NEVER once failed to answer my prayers. The answer isn't always what I wanted it to be. For instance, I begged God to let me win the 1. 6 billion mega millions drawing last month and I didn't win it. Perhaps God knew the money would ruin me? However I also prayed for a job promotion that same week and received it. I may have not always received what I wanted but he has never once failed to provide for my needs. I could never explain why God lets terrible things happen to people, But he is God and I have learned to not question him anymore. He knows what he is doing. ""God has much to answer for"" I used to think this too. I've been assaulted and abused. Lied to and cheated on. I've been hurt over and over. It wasn't until recently I realized these events have made me stronger. I am more aware of my surroundings and I have faith he will protect me. I am a better person all around and I believe God is real and he is perfect. We don't understand why he allows the things he does but chaos breeds miracles. Maybe it is what it takes to bring non-believers to him? Now, There are accusations in the comments that I am unintelligent.

S5732ba4d-Af9462d81	Is This life what you think it is? Hell if you see life wrong maybe the place you end up.	"What can the word of God do? You may say nothing like a animal would fly, run, climb and run away. When a creature is caught for treatment as it wriggles and tries to run from you. Like you wriggle and run from Jesus. You wriggle out of the truth into the darkness. The word of God can help us over come problems and confusions. It shows us how things really are because it is the truth of God revealed to us. You can Trust in Scripture. You act like animals searching for a place to sleep, ending up in a cave to rest for the night. But you need to come out again to live and not sleep. All mans attempts will fall short of God, all attempts by man fall into sin as so would you. If you believe in your attempts you will end up there with them in hell. As they are attempts. And attempts always fail. Otherwise they would be called all mans susses, nothing from man has been sussesful as there is always room for improvements. Even religion, philosophy and good works will fall short of God. And hell is where you fall and do not reach God. You fall into sin. Jesus has died for you to get to God as Jesus was perfect like God. Jesus like God does not die. But Jesus did and you can live. Jesus said to Nicodemus: "" I assure you, unless you are born again, you can never see the Kingdom of God."" ""What do you mean?"" exclaimed Nicodemus. ""How can an old man go back into his mothers womb and be born again?"" Jesus replied, ""The truth is, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of the water and the Spirit. Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives new life from heaven. Everyone who believes in me will have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."" John 3:3-6,15-16. Why would Jesus lie like that if he was the Son of God? ( the Son) Think of it like this as a apple: God the Father-core, God the Son (Jesus) - flesh and God the Holy Spirit - The skin. Jesus said, ""I am the bread of life. No one who comes to me will ever be hungry again. Those who believe in me will never thirst."" John 6: 35. You thirst for the truth but you will never find it. Your hunger for Jesus, but you do not believe in him. Jesus said, ""All right, stone her. But let those who have never sinned throw the first stones!"" God has every right to send you to hell, as you have sinned. When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. Then Jesus stood up again and said to her, ""Where are your accusers? Didn't even one them condemn you?"" ""No, Lord,"" she said. And Jesus said ""Neither do I. Go and sin no more."" John 8:4-5,7,9-11. - This applies to all. I know you are into men and woman. Homo means evil, you have evil sex. Every time you have sex with women. Goes for all. Homo also means same. Jesus said to his people who believed in him, ""You are truly my disciples if you keep obeying my teachings. And you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."" (Like I have claimed many times!) Do you think I'm lying too? Am I not like you, how did I decide that I will change. From a illness or am I delusional? Is it no more like I am telling the truth? Who loses out more, if I am wrong, why would I claim to be right. If I am right why am I right. If you are right who loses out more? If I am wrong and think I am right would not the truth be that I am wrong? And Jesus said, ""I am the truth, the way and the light. No one comes to the father but by me"" John 14:6. Who are you to say I am wrong? You are searching and I have been found. It will take more belief in not to be a God as you have not found a answer and I have. And that is God. Where were you when God made the earth? Who are you to God if you are Not found by him? Therefore who is God to you? Is God not searching for you like you are for him? I have never found God but God found me. Look all you want because the structure of the Universe is God. And everything has a Structure as all was made by God. And all made by humans have a structure. Who are you to say God does not exist? Who are you to say I am wrong? Who are you to say you are right? You can not be right as you do not know your origins. God is my origin. God has revealed the truth. (Don't be stupid and say the Big Bang as were did that come from?) Science and Love: Yes I to think can make you differ in your love towards people, but they can neither take it all away or add it all. As God's love is unlimited. God is love and wisdom filled with anger and forgiveness and justice, etc. That's dropped then. My suffering will come to an end. Joy and glory will follow for eternity. (You can not have no good or evil.) You end either in hell or heaven if that is true. Is this not want you want? If it is the backwards Jesus is leading us into hell and earth would have no life. As hell does Not. This does not make sense. Are you asleep? Why not wake up!! By thinking sins are good, destroys Jesus and makes him evil. When the devil is the one who will be destroyed. The devil is not good and neither are your sins. You are therefore a slave to sin, as a salve is not part of the family. Become a child of God as a child will always be part of the family. Jesus said: ""My sheep recognize my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch the away from me, for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. So no one can take them away from me. The Father and I are one."" - John 10:27-30. If no one can snatch me away am I not ill or delusional? Someone who is delusional can be cured, someone who is ill can get well. The non Christian are the ones who get well and get cured. And say I was, you would not know, as I will die like I am. The God delusion by Richard Dawkins makes no sense. There is no God delusion. You are the one who is delusional. By saying you can become in delusional by falling away from Christ again makes no sense, as who am I falling away from? What made me ill and what caused me to become delusional? As a delusion is from out of the body, which enter into your body falsely. What do I see false about Jesus? With all his teaching. Are his teachings false? If not then why would Jesus lie about God? Who's delusional? I know who. I should write a book on the Devil delusion. I believe in the Devil. Why has Richard Dawkins not written a book on that. Well because It would prove God maybe. You clearly do not understand. Jesus said: ""I am the bread of life. I am the light of the world. I am the gate. I am the good Shepard. I am the resurrection and the life. I am the true vine. (Evolution is not) I am the way, the truth, and the life No one can come to the Father except through me."" - John6:35;8:12;10:9;10:11;11:25;15:1;14:6. Who are you to say Jesus did not exist. How much do you know about life? You going to say Henry the 8th does not exist? I have been to his castle but did not see him. Nothing of the man. But he existed like Jesus did. ""This leaves us with a 50/50 chance based on the little proof or arguments Pro listed in his favor."" I listed nothing of my favor I God didn't find me I would still be like you. The proof is in the favor. You want to do yourself a favor? And admit your self wrong? (God can only find you when you repent. As if you repent and nothing changes, that would make no sense.)

S5d54af1e-Ac1c515f4	God is real, and watching over us.	"If you won't believe God cares about you, you won't believe God cares about you and that means nobody can help you in the end. If you want to believe that way, go ahead and believe in evolution or space aliens or magic or whatever makes you feel better about your fate, and go ahead and blame God forever. God allows you to do that. Evolution has never been observed and is nothing more than a hypothesis; a belief. That's enough for me about evolution in this debate. The debate is not about evolution vx. creation. I will get to the heart of the matter, the heart of God. Con poses this question which is full of questions: "" why would the miracle bringer Jesus be killed and tortured when he had proven himself to God that he was completely devout to him? Surely he would stop the prosecutors of Jesus and punish them as he had punished others? Yet he did not."" Jesus is God. He is not merely ""the miracle bringer"". He was killed because He gave Himself to pay for your sins so he could be satisfied that your debt to Him was paid in full and He can forgive you if you come to Him, believing on His resurrection, for mercy. Jesus knew He would rise from the grave bodily after He gave His life and allowed Himself to be tortured to death. He did it for you. He is God, He is there, and He is watching over you now. He is holding you up now keeping you out of the fire of hell for now. He will not do this forever if you wil not admit that you are the one who deserves to die when He suffered and died in your place so He could secure God's pardon for you to enter heaven. Those who thought they had won in killing Jesus actually were defeated because He defeated death when He rose from the grave. You can have victory over death by believing in Him, receiving Him as you rSavour to be your life. As for the ""Omnipotence Arguement"". The Parodox you propose would be for God to eliminate Himself. The Parodox proposes that God do something that will make Him less tham omnipotent. He will not do this. He cannot make Himself less them omnipotent. He cannot eliminate Himself from being God. "" All we have done here is arrange certain words into a sentence so that it appears to be something that someone could actually do. But it is just a cleverly disguised ""pseudo task."" It is just impossible. Asking God to make a stone too heavy for him to lift is much like asking someone to draw a square circle. It is logically impossible. Not even God can draw a square circle "" not because he lacks something, but because a ""square circle"" is no object at all."" Thank you to Godsnumberis7 for this excellent quote. God is there and wathing over you. Believe it.......He loves you and wants to save you and keep you forever in eternal life in the unimaginably wonderful paradice of heaven. Let Him save you. Admit you need to be saved from your sin. Believe He died in your place and rose from the dead and is willing to forgive you. Call on Him to save you, receive Him by faith. He loves you and He wants to change you forever from eternal death to eternal life. He is there and He is watching over you, calling to you pleading with you to trust Him."	PRO	624
S5fcb7dea-A13dfdd9e	homosexuals going hell ? religion is a joke	"My opponent is living in an unfortunate situation. Arguably, the subject matter his arguments so far speak more about civil rights than theology or religion. The problem he is addressing has more to do an unhealthy mix of religious government and extremism. Indeed, for him, the ""joke"" is one of hypocrisy, intolerant, and murder. WHICH RELIGION TO FOLLOW? In terms of what religion to follow, I can only encourage him to always search for the truth of every matter. Which ever religion or system of faith he finds that support truth and the consistent search for it would be an excellent place to start. However, he must be open to the fact that truth may not always be comfortable, nor will it always accomodate one's preferences. For me, authentic Christianity has served me well for 20 years. ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS FOR BEING GAY I don't think that one can ask for forgiveness for a state that one finds himself in. Sometimes, in humans, doorways are opened that are virtually impossible to close. We can only ask for grace to be extended to us and try go grow closer to Him and His truth. This will also mean taking to to soul search and ultimately make a choice as to the life that one will live. Get away from people who will push you down, and surround yourself with people who will love you through whatever situation you find yourself in. That may not be easy. In cases where it is impossible, you will need to prepare for a life of tribulation and suffering for your convictions. So, I think that if you are gay, yet believe Islam to be true, you must wrestle with your faith to find your god's way to righteousness. Otherwise, you are faced with a difficult dilemma. REWARDED WITH VIRGINS Well, I certainly don't subscribe to the fact that men will receive virgins in heaven. But, your religion also states: ""And there shall wait on them [the Muslim men] young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls."" (Quran 52:24) ""They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who will seem like scattered pearls to the beholders."" (Quran 76:19) So, it won't be all that bad for yuo, I guess. :) BAD GENES I actually do not believe, as many do, that homosexuality is a genetic issue. I believe that it is a psychological one. Not that it is a type of psychosis, but that it is the result of opening one's awareness to something that becomes an obsession. Like people who can't be faithful to their spouses because of their heterosexual impulses, I feel that something opened you up to this and created a fascination with you that you cannot shake. It's almost like an addiction. That's my own belief, but I admittedly do not have many facts to back that up. So, I would say that you have a huge dilemma - you are following a religion that condemns your sexual persuasion, and is being interpretted by people who are willing to murder for their interpretation. I feel horrible for you, and find myself wanting to do something to help, but unable to. NOW, ON TO OUR DEBATE The context of this conversation is not one of a debate. Therefore, because my opponent has been unable to proove that homosexuals will go to heaven according to his religion, and has not been able to prove that religion is a joke, the debate need not go any further. That being said, I extend my sympathies to my opponent and wish him well on his journey to truth. Stay safe."	CON	625

S62c92cb0-A307ae04a	The Bible does not tell that at death, a person goes to Heaven or Hell	"Before starting my arguments, I would first off like to thank 64bithuman for accepting the debate, and I pray that it be a good, fair one, and that the Holy Spirit falls upon each of us with each word we type, and every paragraph we read; that there might be clear understanding and that there is a fluent interpretation of the Scripture- for myself, and for 64bithuman. So, to begin a conversation about death, it must first be clear as to where we came from, and how we got here in the first place! Genesis 2:7 says, ""And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."" All on that Biblical 6th day of creation, we are told that God created man Himself, from the dust of the ground in the beginning. Now keep that thought in your mind, and remember that God made us from the dirt of the ground, because we come back to it! Ecclesiastes 12:7, ""Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."" Read the context of Ecclesiastes 12, and you will see that it is most certainly talking about death. The body turns to dust again, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave it. The spirit of every person who dies--whether righteous or wicked--returns to God at death. And what is the spirit? James 2:26, ""The body without the spirit [breath, in some translations] is dead.."" and Job 27:3, ""All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils"" This spirit that the Scripture tells us about, is the breath of life. Nowhere in all of God's book does the ""spirit"" have any life, wisdom, or feeling after a person dies. It is the ""breath of life"" and nothing more. So, Genesis 2:7 tells us we were formed from dirt and given the breath of life, and from there, ""..man became a living soul."" (as stated in Genesis 2:7 above.) But what is a soul? Genesis 2:7 tells us the a soul is a living being! A soul is always a combination of the two things: body plus breath. A soul cannot exist unless body and breath are combined. God's Word teaches that we are souls. So then, if souls are living, do they ever die? Ezekiel 18:20. ""The soul that sinneth, it shall die..."" and Revelation 16:3, ""...Every living soul died in the sea."" According to God's Word, souls do die! We are souls, and souls die. Man is mortal (Job 4:17). Only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15, 16). The concept of an undying, immortal soul goes against the Bible, which teaches that souls are subject to death. But do good people go to Heaven when they die? John 5:28-29, ""...All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth."" and Acts 2:29-34, ""David ... is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day."" ""For David is not ascended into the heavens."" also Job 17:13, ""If I wait, the grave is mine house..."" Scripture tells us, that no, people do not go either to heaven or hell at death. They go to their graves to await the resurrection day! And how much does someone know or comprehend after death? Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10, ""The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun."" ""There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."" Psalms 115:11, ""The dead praise not the Lord..."" God says that the dead know nothing at all! Some might even use the evidence of ""ghosts"" to claim that the dead still live, and talk, and are aware of what we are doing. Let's look at Job 14:12, 21 first. ""So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."" ""His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."" So despite popular belief, the dead cannot contact the living, nor do they know what the living are doing. They are dead. Their thoughts have perished (Psalms 146:4). The Bible says clearly and blatantly that the dead are dead, they know nothing, and they lie in the grave ""asleep"", waiting for Christ's second return. They are not in Heaven, or Hell, or Purgatory, or any such Limbo. I encourage each of the readers of this debate, to go and read John 11:11-14 right now. This is the brief conversation Jesus has with his disciple regarding Lazarus' death, in which Jesus speaks of death as sleep. Job 14:12, ""So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more."" and 2 Peter 3:10, ""The day of the Lord will come ... in the which the heavens shall pass away."" The dead will sleep until the great day of the Lord at the end of the world. In death, humans are totally unconscious with no activity or knowledge of any kind. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, ""For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."" This verse from 1 Thessalonians tells us exactly what happens to the ""sleeping"" dead at Christ's second return. The dead in Christ shall rise first! If the dead in Christ were already in Heaven, then why would the Scripture tell us that they are going to rise up? There would be no purpose in a resurrection if people were taken to heaven at death!"	PRO	627

Sed1fbd0b-A89b20d2d	Proof That God is Real	"Thank you for the quick and well written response. I'd first like to address your point on science, how you state ""Science is ever changing, and proof today might be different tomorrow."" This isn't a folly of science, but rather an integral and important aspect of it. Our understanding of the world around us changes based on the new evidence that we are able to find. This is important because it allows our understanding of the world to grow and change as we learn new evidence and rethink old ideas. For many years, people believed in strictly the Biblical account of creation. However, Charles Darwin later found evidence and he created his theory of evolution. Science later found further evidence that provided proof that evolution is the best model for creation. This shows how our understanding changes from generation to generation with new discoveries and understandings. With the dinosaur extinction example you use, most of the evidence that science had pointed towards the volcanic eruption theory. Then, the Yucatan Peninsula was discovered and science incorporated the new evidence into their belief system. That is how science works. While some may say that this shows that evidence may later be found for the existence of God, that logic can be applied to literally anything. Currently, I don't believe in leprechauns, but why shouldn't I because proof may be found that point to their existence on a later date? You state that you approach God from a spiritual standpoint, and that is a standpoint that I can respect. However, from this standpoint, God can neither be proven nor disproven. In fact, God can neither be proven nor disproven from a science standpoint. Science is understanding of the world based on discovered evidence, so by the very nature of science, science cannot disprove anything. Science cannot say that God is not real, but science can say that there is a large lack of evidence for the existence of God. I respect your stance that you will find God in your heart, but as I've mentioned before, this belief system can be applied to anything. I could say that I found salvation in fairies, but because I take a stance on it spiritually, you cannot prove nor disprove the existence of a fairy. I would also like to address a theme I read in the comments, a point that I was actually going to make in my first argument: that you look at God only from the Christian standpoint and do not give merit to any other God. If you believe in the Christian God, what causes Him to have any more merit than the Islamic Allah or the Hindu God Vishnu? Richard Dawkins states in The God Delusion, ""we are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further."" I would like to end my argument with the question I had above: what causes your God to have any more merit than the Gods of any other society and what proof shows that He has that higher merit?"

Although this may seem like a 'my word against yours' type of situation, it isn't. On one side there is you claiming that Jesus did rise from the dead and saying that there are accounts of this outside of the Bible, but you seem unwilling (or unable) to present them to me or even tell me what they are. On the other side there is me, saying that there are no such documents. I may be wrong, and I would gladly admit that I'm wrong, if you would but present me with said documents (or provide a reference so that I can confirm). Scientists indeed do say that the Universe is expanding, but asking 'who is doing this' is fallacious since it assumes that someone is the cause of the expansion of the Universe, instead of something (such as natural forces).

On a side note, you seem to be confusing the Big Bang theory, abiogenesis and the theory of evolution, which are three totally separate things. Your question 'How we could come from primates or organisms' is flawed: we are still primates and organisms (in fact every living thing is considered an organism). But to answer your broader question, we evolved (and are technically still evolving) through natural selection and genetic mutations which are passed down through generations. I am not quite sure what you mean by 'we have to originate from something else'. The thing is, both arguments you just presented are absolutely irrelevant to the topic; even if the theory of evolution and the Big Bang theory were proved false tomorrow, you would still need to present actual EVIDENCE for the existence of God. Again, you failed to present me with the characteristics of your God, making it impossible for me to attack its existence.	CON	639
Sae460604-A8e242505	God is real	Thank you for your argument. Do you know that cancer sometimes disappears for medically unknown reasons? You certainly do know that a lot of people that have cancer pray to be cured. Don't you think that it is more likely that these two events happened coincidentally to the same person? Can you explain to me why some people get better without praying and, more importantly, why not everyone who prays is cured? You have basically committed a post hoc fallacy; assuming that, because A happened before B, A must have been the cause of B. Furthermore, let's imagine that the prayer is actually what cured her; unless you believe that John Paul II is God, I fail to see how that is evidence for the existence of God. Anecdotal evidence is the worst possible kind of evidence because humans are vulnerable to too many sources of bias. Thank you for respecting my beliefs, but atheism is not a belief. There are absolutely no extra biblical account of the resurrection of Jesus. And for the record, I do believe Jesus existed, but I do not believe that he was the son of God (or God himself) and I do not believe any of the miracles he apparently performed.

S13093194-Aac4fed93	"The concept of having a pool of ""real names"" to choose from is absured and discourages individuality"	"Thanks for procuring this debate. I'm sure it will be a challenge. I will attempt to refute my opponent's argument before I begin my framework. ""To define is to limit. This simple principle is true in almost all scenarios. A person is to{o} complex to be accurately described with man-made language and to give definitions will only limit them in thier potential."" The first sentence here is absolute. The second is contrary. But, by then on, you see that my opponent has clearly been given the impression everyone can choose their own names. At birth, as the legal system goes, we are given our names by those who birth us: Our parents. This ensures the government can keep tabs on us as a whole and gives us certain sustainable continuities. That being said, it isn't originally OUR name. It is the name our parents give us at birth. In a sense, it is their name before it is bestowed upon us. ""The concept of naming people is most definitely a good one, but it is silly for there to be a set list of ""real names"", or even to bother repeating the same name several times, between people who share absolutely no connection."" Now, when I hear the term ""real names"" I am under the impression he means currently existing names. This is a farce on my opponent's side as a pool of ""real names"" would actually encourage certain parents to be original and make up names that would correspond to their originality. If a pool of real names were to be introduced, parent's with originality would most likely use it... The originality, that is. Therefore, a pool of real names actually encourages naturally original parents to be just that. ""Society has so come to accept this concept of choosing from a list of already-existing names for their child, that it seems absurd to people to hear of a name which was completely invented by the parent. They will say, skeptically, ""is that even a real name?!"". And the answer is: of course it is. If someone is named something, it's, in effect, a real name. How can there possibly be such a thing as a fake name? "" Be that as it may, if parent's delve in a pool of preexisting names, it is only their fault for not having enough originality to think outside of the possibilities given to them. There is no fake name and I agree with my opponent in that aspect. That being said, once a name is made, no matter how original or different it may be, becomes a real name and is therefore, added to the ""real names"" pool. Once the notion is put in the air ""I can name my son (josh, steven, harlan, eli, suzy) One takes that into consideration and then either applies it or uses it in a contrast against the names they want. ""Some names are used so frequently that two people of the same name are friends, or are regularly in the same environment. If someone is frequently in the presence of someone with the same title as them, then they cannot truly have a unique description; adjective; title of themselves. This discourages individuality, and has no logic behind it."" That is why last and middle names are rather useful. I know you may argue that some may be juniors and thirds, but in reality it isn't the name that defines the person, it's their actions and how they live their life. ""We may fool ourselves that they're are plenty of names to have individuality, but if this were true, how is it almost instantly recognizable, within you're culture to determine whether something is a ""real"" name? Think of a person at random that you know, and I bet you that you have either heard thier name before you met them, or know someone else with the name. It is then not the only thing that you associate the name with, and therefore not a truly unique title of them."" This is also a farce as my opponent attempts to defend the fact that names are not individual. Simply because preexisting names are not individual and original, does not mean that the person associated with it has anything there to hinder it. A person is NOT defined by their names. Also, saying that allowing people to see what already exists in order to produce the opportunity to consider a name not already recorded is a splendid idea. ""Many people are given a name that millions of other people have. This is in no way individuality, and is a complete contradiction of purpose of naming people. Why have names at all if they are not unique?"" Consider this: Jane has a child Jane has never heard the name ""Steve"" She names her son ""Steve"" thinking she was original. Steve is, in my opinion and in a google search (http://www.google.com... 276 million results) a very common name. Jane did not know the name Steve existed therefore she was original. ""It is fundamentally absurd to reuse a name as frequently as is done. There is no reason for this, and it only serves to discourage individualism."" My opponent did not explain how anyone is refusing a name. ""Even I, with a very uncommon name, find it frequently in the media, or elsewhere."" Did you mean the name you were given? because a google search produces 9,980,000 results: http://www.harlan.com... http://www.cityofharlan.com... http://www.zwire.com... Just to name a few. although just under ten million is far less common than ""Steve"" it is still very common in itself. Actually... I believe my framework can easily be infered by the above refutations and in light of those reasons and refutations, you vote CON. Thanks, -EG"	CON	641
S9a809f39-A614c8b20	The Christian God is Real	"Thank you Pro, for your response. The universe is so big and old that almost anything can happen on it. The probability of life is incredibly small, yet it has happened. As I mentioned before, we do not know that life can arise in another form with the help of different physical laws, as the life on Earth is the only we know of. Other types of life could well arise out of very different environments. If the physical laws changed now, we would very probably die, as we are adapted to these conditions, but that is not to say that other life-forms could not arise. One example of what we once thought were environments too harsh for animals to survive in include amazing depths in the ocean that contain life in it’s extremely high pressures and cold temperatures. Giant squid, for instance, live up to 1,000 meters deep into the (ocean.http://ocean.si.edu...) Since life arose about 3.8 billions years ago, (http://www.livescience.com...) we know that the possibility does exist that life can arise from nonliving matter rather quickly given the right conditions. About your box analogy, I think the analogy is inappropriate here, because you started with a premise and ended with a completely different conclusion regarding infinity, which was never mentioned. If other universes indeed exist, and these contain even more planets and stars (perhaps with different physical laws from ours) then life is more than probable to arise at some point, not to say, however, that it arises in every single universe. This goes without the assumption that there are an infinite amount of universes, which is frankly irrelevant to this debate. We don't know that life is a single ""white ball"" in a box with trillions of ""black balls"", this is an argument given because we have only seen life appear once, which does not mean it cannot arise elsewhere or is a singularity. It does not even mean that life has a low probability of existing elsewhere either. I don’t see what is impossible or what infinity has to do with this point, and if I have not cleared doubts with what I just said, please elaborate. “..pointed out that there are 2,000 different enzymes made out of amino acids, so all of those to have been formed by chance is a whopping one out of 10^40,000 odds."" The type of life existing today is not the same that arose billions of years ago. Indeed, when life did arise, enzymes would have been seen as extremely advanced compared to what life probably was when it first formed, it most probably was something even simpler. As I said before, all of life did not arise suddenly, most probably one organism at a time, which means you do not need 2,000 different enzymes created by chance, because life appeared with one organism that could change. What probably happened is that over time one enzyme formed from simpler things, and then branched off to different ones not by chance, but by natural selection, which is quite simple: http://evolution.berkeley.edu... http://www.amnh.org...; ""No one has ever stated on exactly how this all happened by random mutation and natural selection."" There are perfectly logical explanations to this process, and I already named three sources. There are examples in evolution in several animals including moths (which evolved to their environment, changing color) and the evolution of E. Coli strains over time. http://listverse.com...; You unfortunately missed my point when I said that the gospels are anonymous. I meant that we do not know who Mark, Matthew, Luke and John are, they are merely names written on a piece of paper and are not related to anyone we know of. And again, other writings might claim that Jesus was resurrected, this does not mean that it actually happened, especially when the eyewitnesses are name-less, unknown and wrote their testimonies more than 30 years after the event happened. (I mean eyewitnesses for people who were there at the time and place) You have repeated the same argument twice, so my response is the same: There are writings that say Confucius’ mother was impregnated by a unicorn, this does not mean that it happened. Thousands of Muslim documents claim the prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse, this does not mean it happened, unless evidence is presented that it did. ""Why not treat them like chemical accidents like they think they are?"" We know evolution was the process by which we came to life, this does not mean that we follow evolution as a moral code. We know, for example, that we are made up of stardust, exploded stars, this does not mean we will go around exploding stars around the galaxy. We are a bunch of chemical reactions and small cellular structures, this is a fact, so we will treat each other equally because we are the same. What we are made of makes no difference in terms of morality. As mentioned before, we normally don’t mind lions because they are a different species, but I never said that a lion killing another lion (or any animal) would in any way be justified. Technically this does not matter at all TO THE UNIVERSE, but we have an evolved morality, which tells us it is not fair to kill a living thing, because we have evolved to survive on the planet and we know other animals did the same thing, and so there is a price on every life (an effort). How does morality tie to God anyways? Only because the Bible said it was given to us by Him, of course, and this again is not proven, other believers claim it came to be because of another deity or supernatural occurrence. No evidence is given that it was brought to us by a God. This is not an evolutionary debate, however, and though I have cleared up a lot of misconceptions on the past paragraphs (for the sake of comprehension), you have still not provided any evidence to prove that the Christian God is real. Your arguments are based on missing information, and you use these to point to your God. If I were a Hindu, I would use your same arguments and say it is all proof of Brahma, or I could say it is all work of the all powerful Zoroaster. Presenting a hypothetical figure to explain the unknown does not solve the problem, it only complicates it further. As of so far, any religious believer could use your claims (except for Jesus) to point to their own God, which goes contrary to the topic of this debate (The Christian God is Real). The arguments you have given are used for a deist point of view, and you have shown no relation to the things we don’t know that bind them to the Christian God. As I said in my first argument we need evidence that it was the Christian God, and not just fill in the blanks with anyone's preference. You are using a logical fallacy that goes by the name of the argument from ignorance, which basically says: X is true because you cannot prove that X is false."	CON	642
Sabfed07a-A59c79e74	official catholic church teaching is that noncatholics and unbaptized infants go to hell	"It brought up a lot of questions about my former faith and it was interesting to research the Catholic Church from this perspective. As my opponent pointed out I did debate from the perspective of a Catholic and it was a fun exercise. Non-Catholic salvation I would like to clarify how, from a Catholic (or rather the official Catholic perspective), the statement made in the Cante Dominio and the statements made in Vatican II are both infallible. I actually did mention this apparent contradiction is rectified. In the Cantate Dominio helped establish the dogmatic idea that ""outside the church there is no salvation"". This idea was repeated by at least 3 Popes between 1200-1400. This idea is not necessarily overruled by the statements made at Vatican II. The statements made at Vatican II say that non-Catholics and non-Christians can be saved if they are ignorant of the Church and if they act as God wills. This seems to blatantly contradict the Cantate however, the nature of their salvation is of pivotal importance. These members of the Church who have not joined but are ignorant receive a Catholic salvation. They are united with the church in spirit even if they are not members of it, therefore they receive salvation through the Church. ""if he seeks God sincerely and if he follows the commands of his conscience, for through this means the Holy Ghost acts upon all men; this divine action is not confined within the limited boundaries of the visible Church."" Though they are not visibly members of the Church they are spiritually members of the Church. Therefore non-Catholics receive salvation through the Church, which satisfies the infallibility of the Bull Cantate and Vatican II. In summary: Since they are both infallible, which my opponent has NEVER CHALLENGED, Vatican II must be regarded by the Church (and the readers!) as infallible, authoritative Catholic teaching, therefore non-Catholics may be saved through the Catholic church. 1 more objection to my opponent on this subject ""there's been plenty of saints who thought the rigorist view."" Saints do not really matter in official teachings of the Church. The full authority of the Catholic Church says it is one way, if the saint disagrees then the saint is simply wrong. Infants and Limbo I would like to loudly and enthusiastically object to the following statement by my opponent regarding the CCC- ""the catechism is not considered an official teaching. it is just a teaching. the older catechisms say they go to limbo. limbo is a part of hell. to be considered official, it has to be the pope intentionally binding the church on faith and morals. that is not present in those catechism teachings"" The CCC is official church teaching, and the Church NEVER OFFICIALLY endorsed limbo. The CCC was authored by a convention called by John Paul II, it was endorsed by John Paul II and deemed official Church teaching by John Paul II. It is authoritative Catholic teaching, as are all Catechisms. http://www.usccb.org... http://www.usccb.org... Here is what John Paul said about Catechism-- ""The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I approved June 25th last and the publication of which I today order by virtue of my Apostolic Authority, is a statement of the Church's faith and of catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition, and the Church's Magestirium. I declare it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith and thus a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion."" John Paul II, who by his papal authority summoned, authorised, and endorsed the CCC says it is official teaching. All catechisms are official teachings. Therefore what the CCC says on infantile deaths is the official Catholic position, and the CCC says there is no definitive answer. On limbo- it does not and never did exist as an official Catholic teaching. It was never presented authoritatively by the Church as a real argument. Even wikipedia knows that. And Benedict officially killed the idea in 2007 anyway. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.reuters.com... My opponent questions how I say babies are not damned when there is an inference they might be. There are a few ways- 1. They are martyrs, so they go to heaven 2. They are ignorant of the Church, so they go to heaven 3. God is merciful and can, in his infinite power and wisdom, make a merciful exception for murdered infants In any case, Pro's guess is as good as mine, because the official Church teaching is that they don't know either. They CCC says so, Pope Benedict said so, that's the way it is. ""The conclusion of this study is that there are theological and liturgical reasons to hope that infants who die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal happiness even if there is not an explicit teaching on this question found in revelation,"" -The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised, 2007, authorised by Pope Benedict I don't think you get more explicit or official than that. Conclusion There were 2 contentions on the table in this debate. The first was whether non-Catholics can be saved. I have shown that authoritative Catholic teaching says they can be saved. My opponent never challenged the official teaching authority of Vatican II, therefore he has failed to prove that the Catholic Church does not follow this teaching and has failed his BOP on point 1. My opponent dismissed Vatican II as political which does not take away from its teaching authority. Since my opponent was responsible for proving both points to win, this should be enough for him to lose the debate. The second point was on infant death. I have shown that official Church teaching says there is no answer. My opponent did not address the substance of my argument (but in fairness I did find one in round 2) and rather attempted to, incorrectly, say that Catechisms are not official Church teachings. Since he is incorrect in saying so, and since he did not otherwise prove that the Church said they were damned, I think this point also goes to con. My opponent also based his argument on limbo, which is not Catholic, and on the fact that they were not baptized, even though point 1 shows that non-Catholics (non-baptized people) can be saved. Keep in mind only 1 point needs to go to Con for a win. Pro had burden of proof for both claims. If he failed to convince you on either count than send a vote my way! I'd like to apologize for my spelling and grammar. I realized after the fact that I dropped some critical words from my round 1 argument which may have made it harder to understand and I realized in round 3 I was spelling 'Cantate' wrong the whole time. Hope no one had any difficulty understanding what I was trying to say."	CON	643
S1cce27af-A576b0d38	The God of classical theism is real.	"Deuteronomy 29:29 tells us that the secret things belong to God. In essence, human beings are not entitled to know everything God knows. Isaiah 55:8 tells us that the ways & thoughts of God are not the same ways & thoughts of human beings. God may allow things to happen, including evil things, that we may never truly understand, nor are we meant to understand. Suffering comes from sin. Sin is disobedience to God. I accept offsetting arguments of a priori. Evolution and Creation are models that cannot be repeated in a test, therefore people are free to choose which they will accept. How can one person define reasonable belief? Clearly, there are millions of people who do accept the God of the Bible. What criteria did they use? Clearly there are millions of people who do not accept the God of the Bible. What would it take to make them believe? What type of instrument could one use to measure reasonbility? Theologists will offer arguments such as Cosmological, Teleological, Ontological, as well as General and Special Revelation. Throughout the Gospel, Jesus clearly explained that many people would not accept the truth. This has proven timeless to date. Many people whave chosen not to believe. God allowed human beings to have a free will. In the Bible, God indicated that he was not willing that any should perish, but that all should have eternal life. He also indicates that He knows many will reject the Bible. From Drange, I would disagree with point #3. Simply because people refuse to believe that God exists, does not mean the He doesn't. It merely means they refused to accept that God existed. I have never been to Eritrea, does that mean I could refuse to believe that such a place existed? Even if I refused to believe Eritrea existed, does that make it any more or any less real? Another point of argument that is difficult to accept is that of God's omniscience. The arguments posed by secularists are lacking the insight of God. Secularists only choose to see things through human cognition. They sell themselves far short because they are arguing from 2 levels below God's intelligence. According to scripture, the earth continues by providence & preservation which was at the discretion and design of God. Just because human beings choose to reject signs and revelations of God does not mean that God has not revealed Himself. How many times have people ignored even common traffic warning signs? I submit to you that through the Bible, general revelation, special revelation, providence, preservation, and the not so scientific arguments of cosmological, teleological, and ontological that God does indeed exist. Human beings, debaters notwithstanding, rely upon human postulated science and the opinion of dead philosophers far more than is ""reasonable"". It should be noted that the same dead scientists and philosophers know whether or not they were correct. Some day, the readers of this debate will know for sure as well."	PRO	644
Sc2f7e0ec-A886d237f	If God were real, (she, he) would be a homicidal manic.	"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. ""For God did not send the son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. (John 3:16- 17) God made the rules, why would God so filled with love and grace, sacrifice his son to a horrific death, to pay for the sins he had given people? Ok i suggest i can of help my opponent understand God becuase he is kind of lost. Then i will defend myself more. First of all he states this ,""to pay for the sins he had given people?"" God didn't just have a hand full of sin and throw it onto the planet. In fact as shown in Genisis God made the world and he saw that it was good. He didn't create the world for evil his purpose for manifesting the Earth was for good. Another thing to consider is what God wants us to do 1. Micha 6:8 - He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 2.Galations 5:22- But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 3. John 4:22 God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth. There's many scriptures of course that descibe God's purpose for us but look at the last one. God wants us to worship him so this further disproves your claim that God wanted sin to be here. Also again what most people know who don't even believe in God and what i want you to know as well is that Adam and Eve caused sin to exist in this world. Because they ate from the tree Sin manifested. The punishment for Eve was of course the painful process that women have now giving birth. ALso they were baned from the Garden. Now to your next point which is really just a question for me to answer. That is psychotic. When your making the rules to your game, and one of them is to sacrifice your son. To expect a man to sacrifice his son to prove his loyalty. 1. How could this make sense to anyone? 2. How can people believe this is a wonderful thing, worthy of their love, devotion and worship? The DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders is where you will find a more accurate description of God. Conclusion: God didn't want to give up his son. No one does ovboiuslly but becuase of Adam and Eve he had to. That's why religions that worship Adam and Eve are wrong. However you ask a question that actully is a good quesiton to ask. And i will answer it so you actully understand what you aredebating about. Why would god sarifice his son? Why would he do it for no reason isn't that ludicrous, isn't that crazy? Yes it is, the point however is God didn't sacrifice his son for no reason. 1. IF god didn't sacrfice his son we would all be going to hell because sin would continue to flourish. He sent JEsus cause of our sins. 1 Peter 3:18 - For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: Isaiah 53:5 - But he [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 2. In fact Jesus when ressurected even took away the keys of hell from the devil as shown in Mathews 12:40. The devil had the keys to hell and we were doomed for hell. 3. The last reason is one you might not have heard of. God sacrifieced his son to provide a sort of roadmap to make it to heaven. Repentence: God has offered a way for us to repent. WE now can say we are sorry for our sins and turn our life over to God. Baptism Baptism is not an option; there is no such thing in the Bible as a Christian who was not baptized. John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Sub point A: You must be immersed in water Because Jesus was baptized by immersion Because every baptism in the Bible is by immersion Because that's precisely what the word baptism means Because it is the best portrayal of a burial and resurrection Sub point B: You must be baptized in Jesus name Every baptism in acts was performed in Jesus' name. THE DAY OF PENTECOST: Acts 2:38- be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins THE SAMARITANS: Acts 8:16- they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus THE HOUSE OF CORNELIUS: Acts 10:48- he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord THE DISCIPLES OF JOHN: Acts 19:5- they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Conclusioni: All of this was provided beuase of Jesus Then the holy ghost Romans 8:14-16 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. You know you have received the Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues. Scriptures for this= Isaiah 28-with stammering lips and another tongues Joel 2- I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh Acts 2- Jewish disciples on the Day of Pentecost Acts 10 Acts 19- disciples of John the Baptist Mark 16-17 John 7:38-39 Jesus didn't die for nothing.

Sae460281-A39d88e46	God is real	"May the records show that, because Pro may a positive statement, the burden of proof is on him; he must prove that a God exists, while my goal will be to neutralize and cast doubt on his arguments. I only have 10 minutes to do this, for some reason, so I'm going to focus on my arguing why, logically, Pro's position doesn't make any sense, rather than sourcing arguments. My first argument is that there is no evidence for his position and there is absolutely no reason that a God would be needed. If he wants to use the Prime Mover argument, I would counter that his position extends ad infinitum -- that is, if he says that we cannot explain our surroundings, and therefore there must be a creator, I would ask him how God was created. Did a God create that God, who created another God, who created another God? Where did that God exist if not in a universe or a perceivable reality? If that is the case, then how could he create that reality? Pros's case will likely be that God has no beginning or end. However, he must prove this and, in the process, disprove Einstein's theory of relativity. I'll conclude by pointing to Occam's Razor. It goes like this: ""When you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions, the simpler one is the better"" (1). The competing theory is whether there is a God who created the universe, or whether it was capable of self-creating. We know that, for a God to exist, he must have self-created and existed in some semblance of reality. Thus, the universe can self-create and my theory is plausible, while his has no basis for it. Finally, I'd like to ask Pro whether which God he is speaking of. Is the term universal, or is he speaking of the God of the Bible? Is the source for his contention the Bible? If that is the case, I'd point out the events in the Bible -- e.g., Great Flood, creation story, young earth, etc. -- that cannot be taken as literally true. If he'd like to go that route, we can certainly do so. I'll yield back to Pro at this point. 1. http://math.ucr.edu..."	CON	646

This simple principle is true in almost all scenarios. A person is to complex to be accurately described with man-made language and to give definitions will only limit them in thier potential. There is, though, one term or adjective that will properly describe a person without limiting them: thier name. A name should be a thing, for the most part, unique, so as to incourage individuality, and so a name can be a true description and adjective to each person. The concept of naming people is most definitely a good one, but it is silly for there to be a set list of ""real names"", or even to bother repeating the same name several times, between people who share absolutely no connection. Society has so come to accept this concept of choosing from a list of already-existing names for their child, that it seems absurd to people to hear of a name which was completely invented by the parent. They will say, skeptically, ""is that even a real name?!"". And the answer is: of course it is. If someone is named something, it's, in effect, a real name. How can there possibly be such a thing as a fake name? Some names are used so frequently that two people of the same name are friends, or are regularly in the same environment. If someone is frequently in the presence of someone with the same title as them, then they cannot truly have a unique description; adjective; title of themselves. This discourages individuality, and has no logic behind it. We may fool ourselves that they're are plenty of names to have individuality, but if this were true, how is it almost instantly recognizable, within you're culture to determine whether something is a ""real"" name? Think of a person at random that you know, and I bet you that you have either heard thier name before you met them, or know someone else with the name. It is then not the only thing that you associate the name with, and therefore not a truly unique title of them. Many people are given a name that millions of other people have. This is in no way individuality, and is a complete contradiction of purpose of naming people. Why have names at all if they are not unique?

Sb42b1da5-Ab34cfe6c	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	"My thanks to Pro for creating this debate, and I hope that we will have a constructive discussion on this subject. There seems to be a little bit of a difference between the opponents debate topic, and his opening statement. My interpretation of his opening arguments is that the theory of evolution is flawed, that many of the origin theories, such as abiogenesis, and the Big bang theory cannot be used to explain the origins of the cosmos, and that a personal God (not necessarily Christian) is real either as a result of this or for separate reasons that he has not outlined. If my opponent feels this is an unfair representation of the debate, I would like to invite him to clarify in the comments. I will not conduct lawyering over the misuse of the term ""Evolution"" to include the big bang theory/Abiogensis, but would invite my opponent to try and use appropriate terminology where possible. As my opponent outlined what his arguments would be ahead of the first post, I feel its only fair for me to do the same: What I intend to show in my arguments are as follows: - That evolution is a well supported, well evidenced theory, with no fundamental flaws as my opponent suggests. - That the big bang theory and to a lesser extent abiogenesis, while incomplete provides an explanation of the origin of the universe, with the deeper atheistic philosophical questions concerning the origins of the universe being neither illogical, nor incoherent in this respect. - I also plan to show that a personal God is a less rational answer to the universal question of origins. Obviously, these are subject to change, depending on the arguments of my opponents. While I should have confirmed this prior to the debate, I would prefer we use the second round for our arguments only, with the final round for rebuttals, but am quite happy for my opponent to set the general rules for this debate. I wish my opponent the best of luck, and hope this will develop into an engaging and thought provoking debate."	CON	654
Sa2c55eda-Aee2710b0	God is not real	I believe that god does not exist for many reasons. I will just be saying for now the simple reason of logic. Its not very hard to use your brain and when i use mine, i dont really see a spirit outside of the universe. The universe is everything in the world and it doesnt make sense if something is outside of it. Im not going to belive in something that i cant see or something that there is absolutely no evidence for. Also why did God only perform miracles back when nobody needed them, i mean he doesnt seem to be doing much now and the world needs it more than it did before. Anyone with a brain could understand why God does not exist. Thankyou!	PRO	655
Sa2c55eda-A386e7575	God is not real	You say it doesn't make sense of something outside the universe exists. Not making sense isnt a logical argument. Also God as a being performing miracles is one of the forms people have said God may assume. In essence, God is imagined as some being with powers or knowledge greater than humans and with some sort of involvement in creation of the universe or life. Just because you personally can not imagine a God doesn't logically disprove the existence of one. Now for my main argument, if you are into physics,you will know that simulations of the big bang have been done with variations in fundamental quantities and it has been found that if some quantities, like mass of a proton or charge of an electron were even slightly different, a universe like ours couldn't exist. This leads to the belief that there must be something beyond or above that has fixed these values at the exact values which allow life and a universe like ours to exist. One more question which the existence of god would answer would be how did our universe start, or how was it created?	CON	656
Sa2c55b38-Aba3261ec	God is not real	"I'm going to try to explain as best I can how God did not ""poof"" into existence. God is eternal, meaning he exists outside of our boundaries of time and space. He cannot be within our boundaries of time and space, because if you make the universe eternal, you get the problem of infinite regression. However, the universe had a starting point. God is on a plane of existence not defined by science. In fact, science was created by God and given to humans as something to explore and use to our advantage. I'm just going to provide the Kalam Cosmological Argument as my solidified proof of God. (1) Everything that has a beginning of its existence has a cause of its existence. (2) The universe has a beginning of its existence. Therefore: (3) The universe has a cause of its existence. (4) If the universe has a cause of its existence then that cause is God. Therefore: (5) God exists. Premise 4 is the big one that needs to be decided. Why does it have to be God? Well, it's not completely necessary, but in order to negate the debate, I at least need to cast doubt on the statement ""God does not exist"" in order to keep it from being affirmed. Now, the beginning of the universe in the scientific community is determined by theoretical physics. Theoretical physics can try to determine causes or reasons for natural phenomena, but it cannot prove anything. So essentially, God and theoretical physics have equal ground in the realm of proof. Because of this, the resolution cannot be affirmed because my opponent's BoP is not fulfilled."	CON	657

Sa066f3fc-A738e7b45	Is God real	I believe they all have different interpretations of God in general. To say God cannot exist because there are other beliefs does not prove or disprove anything; it is simply the assertion that there are many religions, and many interpretations as to what God is. To assert the idea that God does not exist would mean you would need to show evidence of first hand exploration of literally everything.

Sa066f3fc-A5dd15565	Is God real	"Literally, I would agree with you - four thousand years ago, there was probably no flood. There wasn't any historical evidence; only biblical. However, there have been accounts (like I've shown sources for in R1) that show huge floods, much like the one spoken about in the bible, with geological evidence. And considering the idea that a day back in the biblical era wasn't literally 24 hours as it is today, this gives the impression that the flood didn't literally happen 4,500 years ago. This, along with the idea that God created Earth and the Universe in 6 days, which is quite ridiculous, sends us to the understanding that the Bible isn't literal, and shouldn't be taken literally, but as a metaphor, in most of the stories. This does not disprove the existence of God. This ""disproves"" (notice the quotations) the idea of a flood sweeping the earth a mere thousands of years ago. It doesn't even disprove that, you just say the lack of evidence other than the Bible (which I agree, is not ""evidence"") shows that there is no way a flood swept Earth. However, with my sources in R1, and this new one here [1], it is quite possible that there was a flood some thousand years ago, as well as ones in more recent times, and past times, all backed up with actual geographical evidence. The Bible being 100% accurate or not has almost nothing to do with God's existence. It is the word of God, but written by man. God is all-knowing, man is not. The only way anyone can actually disprove the existence of anything is to explore every inch of the observable Universe, and also prove (somehow) that there is nothing more in existence than the universe that we live in. I don't really like having to resort to that argument, so I will happily let you make another couple arguments and present any questions, as well as a closing statement. If what you say has any relevance to God's existence (or lack of), I would love to hear it. So far you've said the Great Flood is known to be a myth, (which I have proven could have happened, as we have actual evidence of floods much like the one from the Bible) and that God is not forgiving - which is wrong; God IS forgiving, you just have to seek him out and ask for forgiveness, and it would be a pretty good idea not to go against any of the commandments while you're at it.

S694fa764-A646d680f	Catholicism is Not Real Christianity	"Definitions: Prayer (Christian): The attempt by a believer to contact and speak with God Christianity: The belief that all of man kind is sinful (Isaiah 53:6, John 3:3, Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23), the penalty for sin is eternity in hell (Romans 6:23, Romans 5:12, 2nd Thessalonians 1:8, Revelation 20:15, Revelation 21:8), Jesus came to earth and died in our place (Romans 5:8, John 3:16, 1st Timothy 1:15, 1st Peter 1:18-19), and that faith in Jesus Christ is the ONLY path to Heaven (John 11:25, John 14:6, John 6:40, Mark 1:15, Acts 26:18, Romans 10:13, 1st Corinthians 3:11, Galatians 3:26). Worship: Reverent honor and homage paid to god or a sacred personage, or to any object regarded as sacred. (http://dictionary.reference.com...) Bible: Sacred text written and inspired by God teaching mankind morality, truth, and the path to Heaven. The Catholic Church: The Christian church characterized by an episcopal hierarchy with the pope as its head and belief in seven sacraments and the authority of tradition. (Read Matthew 15:3, 6, 7) (http://www.thefreedictionary.com...) Pagan: Pertaining to the worship or worshipers of any religion that is neither Christian, Jewish, nor Muslim. (http://dictionary.reference.com...) 1. My opponent states that the Catholics do not pray to the saints, but merely ask them to pray for them, as they would ask a friend to pray for them. But, truthfully there is a difference. When asking someone such as a friend to pray for you, it is intended that their prayer go to God. But... There is no Biblical statement allowing or making it neccesary to use saints as mediators. Actually, the Bible condemns such acts. Asking a saint to ""pray for us"", is using the saint as a mediator between the prayer-giver and God. But Jesus says He is the ONLY mediator: ""For there is one God, and ONE MEDIATOR between God and men, the man CHRIST JESUS."" - 1st Timothy 2:5 (Emphasis mine). Also see John 14:6. As you can see, Jesus makes no mention of asking dead saints to pray for us. In fact, the Bible never even mentions canonization of saints! Every single believer, living AND dead, is a saint! (http://www.gotquestions.org...). ""Thou shalt not make unto thee ANY graven image, or ANY likeness of ANY THING that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt NOT BOW DOWN thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;..."" - Exodus 20:4-5 (Emphasis mine). http://3.bp.blogspot.com... While it is true that the Jews in Old Testament times created idols, it is also true the O.T. Jews were punished for idolatry many times by God. Exodus 20:4 specifically states that idols are prohibited. ""Thou shalt not many unto thee any graven image..."". My opponent claims that it is okay to have images as long as they are not worshipped. He claims they are used to remind us of parts of the faith. A statue of Jesus will invitably remind someone of Jesus, right? Jesus is to be worshipped. What this does is cause the statue to be venerated, which is idolatry. Examples are when Catholics kneel to the alter and bow to statues or pictures. The reason that not many Catholics realize this is because it is not taught: The Ten Commandments in the Bible: ONE: 'You shall have no other gods before Me.' TWO: 'You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.' THREE: 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.' FOUR: 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.' FIVE: 'Honor your father and your mother.' SIX: 'You shall not murder.' SEVEN: 'You shall not commit adultery.' EIGHT: 'You shall not steal.' NINE: 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.' TEN: 'You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.' (http://www.allabouttruth.org...; Exodus 20) Taught in Catholic Catechism: ONE: I am the LORD your God. You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve. TWO: You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. THREE: Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day. FOUR: Honor your father and your mother. FIVE: You shall not kill. SIX: You shall not commit adultery. SEVEN: You shall not steal. EIGHT: You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. NINE: You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. TEN: You shall not covet your neighbor's goods. (http://www.beginningcatholic.com...) Notice that the Ten Commandment taught in the Catholic Catechism is MISSING the 2nd Commandment taught in the Bible, the one speaking about idolatry! It has been deleted! As an ex-Catholic, I remember being taught the second list, in fact, that is the list in the back of my old Catechism book! All they did to keep it ten Commandments was split number ten in half and make it two separate ones. Revelation 22:18-19: ""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" It is a damnable sin to add to the Bible or to take from it, yet the Catholic Church has done both. 2. Opposite of popular belief, Peter is NOT the rock that the Church was built on; Jesus was. The CHRISTian Church was founded by CHRIST, not Peter. The word ""Peter"" actually means ""little pebble"". Jesus is the Rock (Foundation) of the Church, not a pope. Jesus was described many times as the ""conerstone"", which is the most important part to a structure. (http://bible.cc...). The papcy is sinful. The Pope is called ""The Vicar of Christ"", meaning Jesus' ""stand-in"" guy on earth. The only ones who ""stand-in"" are the saints themselves. The Church is ordered to do Christ's work on earth. This is one of the New Testament's central themes. A common way to address the pope is ""Holy Father"". The name Holy Father is mentioned once in the Bible... it is speaking of God! John 17:11: ""And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. HOLY FATHER, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are."" (Emphasis mine). The pope (as well as priests) claim they can forgive sins. Catholics once again claim that the priest is only a mediator, BUT... ""For there is one God, and ONE MEDIATOR between God and men, the man CHRIST JESUS."" - 1st Timothy 2:5 (Emphasis mine). Priests are also called ""father"". Matthew 23:9: And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven."" My opponent says that ""Our need for the hierarchy is also based off of our need for the Sacraments."" Sacraments are NOT Biblical. John 3:3 states someone must be born again to gert salvation, not that they need to complete seven sacraments. These are traditions of man. ""Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God BY YOUR OWN TRADITION? Ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites."" - Matthew 15:3, 6, 7 (emphasis mine).

S33b32f5f-A5d05bb0d	Is God real and is the Bible accurate	"You say the bible doesn't have mistakes. There are many. The bible was first handed down from generation to generation in songs, narratives, and poetry. The bible was first officially written in roughly 380 ad. That's a long time in-between. Genesis was told to Moses directly by god. Then he had to pass the word down generation to generation for century's. There is no way that everything was remembered exactly as it was supposed to. Is that not evidence that the bible is not accurate. I haven't even talked about what is actually in the bible yet. The bible is inaccurate on a vast amount of accounts that at the time weren't inaccurate. If there was a god and he ""inspired a bible for everyone. He would make sure that there were no errors in it. i'll assume that by the bible being accurate you mean that the bible is not only true for the time period it was written, but true for all time periods. -Matthew 15:2 ""Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"" Before germ theory people would have not known that washing your hands would stop disease. They didn't know this at the time. Genesis 3 The whole thing about a talking snake. There has never been any recorded evidence of a talking snake and i find it odd that anyone believes in such a crazy story. Romans 10:18 But ""I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."" The whole world heard the word of god. Including the Native Americans and the Asians? All of Jesus's miracles have no recorded evidence. You would think such things would be written down somewhere by someone. Matthew 2:16 "" Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men"" Herod kills all boys in and around Bethlehem that are two years old and under. Such a massacre would certainly have been noted by contemporary historians, but it isn't. Matthew 4:2 ""And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered"" nobody even someone like Jesus would have gone that long without food. Matthew 4:8 ""Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them"" There is no mountain that can show all the kingdoms. Unless people back then thought that the earth was flat. There are a lot of problems with the bible and these are only a few. The bible is not accurate and i hope you can agree with me on that. ""The Bible does not support rape, murder stealing or anything of that nature. It is very against it. why don't you instead of looking it online because things can be changed ONLINE look in an actually copy of the Bible to get your answers then do some cross checking online to clarify."" First off i find it funny that you think that a bible being but online somehow makes it somehow unreliable, BUT find it completely ok for the unreliability it the translations and edits of the bible over the years. MURDER IN THE BIBLE God murdered millions of people in the flood including young children. Leviticus 20:13 ""If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives."" Exodus 21:15 ""Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death."" 2 Chronicles 15:12-13 ""They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."" RAPE IN THE BIBLE ""Lo, a day shall come for the Lord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. And I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken, houses plundered, WOMAN RAVISHED; half of the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city."" (Zechariah 14:1-2) ""They must be dividing the spoils they took: there must be a damsel or two for each man, Spoils of dyed cloth as Sisera's spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil."" (Judges 5:30) If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. (Deuteronomy 22:28-29) ""if people didn't actually see Jesus of Nazareth do these amazing miracle's why would they turn away from there very strong belief"" Why is Mormonism gaining followers every year. He saw an angel and it told him the truth. why would people they turn away from the beliefs they have? The last thing i will say is i ask you to give be evidence and proof that god is real.

S224da923-Aa9cc758b	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"This is CURRENTLY, not 2 years ago. This is against the same opponents over a consistent period of time. 1- It true in the league Madrid has more points than Barcelona and more goals but if we look at this debate it is meant between Barcelona and Madrid rather than the many teams they face because I can say Madrid one every match in la liga but still hasn't beat Barcelona to me that just shows that it is better than all the other teams and it one the league but they didn't win once against Barcelona. second Madrid is going for it first la liga in the past 3 years so if they keep there winning streak good for them that is 1 trophy. Barcelona on the other hand won 5 trophies last year and again hopefully will win them again. 2- Now messi and ronaldo rather than look at combine let us look at them separately that how we know who is more distinguished. In the matter about footwork in every game I have watched for both Madrid and Barcelona I have noticed that in Barcelona messi has outstanding footwork followed by both afellay and inesta. In Madrid ronaldo was as good as messi and he was and currently is worse than he was on Manchester united which is why you put that video. Second benzima and kaka have much better foot work than ronaldo and ronaldo all he got is speed and goals that all sometimes but very rare he has a great play which brings me to my next point assists. Of course you even said it your self messi in every game alone has more assists than ronaldo alone which is why you combined goals and assists before. I already said that he has more goals but its known that messi has more assists. Since we are talking about the current year and current players not that its different from the past but in 2004 he was the best and again Manchester united bro I agree he was great but is using past tense because the games themselves show the truth and all he does is score and nothing else. If I were to continue the fact the messi and the rest of the team are more in sync than Madrid could ever be. The many and many successful passes Barcelona does in each game and the way each pass is made makes the other team look like amateur. Madrid on the other hand has bad sync and they only force there way through rather than in a strategic way. In the end Messi is currently better than ronaldo no matter how you look at it. Messi can do many things while ronaldo can only score goals. Not that scoring goals is bad but it is only used to compare teams the way you keep pointing out. 3- Bro stop trying to justify that game by putting together the overall cards achieved in the game at Cope del rey where they tied. In that game both teams against each other the fact that they got all those card while Barcelona only had 3 shows that Madrid couldn't have tied with out fouling. Soccer isn't determined by size bro messi is small but makes a fool of those bigger than him on the field. The fact is that soccer is a team sport and it needs endurance so the excuse that it is because Madrid has a nothing to do with the physical standard of the player because a foul is a foul in any language and the only people who would disagree with that are fans and the same thing going around. If real Madrid can play fair the way I said they would lose to Barcelona no matter what and what proved that was the previous matches between both teams. 4- Madrid may have taken one trophy but we can also say the Barcelona has one too so they are tied at that standards. Then we look who one more matches between them since my debate is who is currently better Madrid hasn't one once and Barcelona has won twice and tied once. Currently between both teams Barcelona has a higher standards no matter how much difference in goal between real and Barcelona. The fact remains that for the past 3 years Madrid hasn't won Barcelona except once and that was from 2010-2011 cope del rey which was the only cup Barcelona lost that year since they had 5 trophies. Since this debate is about the current time and it is between Madrid and Barcelona no other team, as the title of the debate states, ""soccer: Barcelona is currently better than real Madrid"" Barcelona as I stated before ranks better in charisma and teamwork which are both flaws in Madrid and also they won Madrid in the CURRENT leagues every single time even that tie was a win which cost Madrid to advance in the Cope del rey so currently Barcelona has proved to be at a higher stand than Madrid."

S30b19de3-Af5ecf344	The God of Abrahamic religions is not real. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam)	"You seem to misunderstand what I mean when I say you can't take it literally. I don't mean to say that what you don't take literally is false, instead, I am saying that there is a deeper meaning behind the text. But I do agree that there are flaws in the Bible due to translation issues over the years. However, a few errors, whether they are related to translation or not, do not make the whole text invalid. Let me give an example where this is true. In Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, he hypothesized something called the Aether, which was the medium which light and EM waves traveled. Now we know that this Aether is completely false, however, every other part of Maxwell's theory is correct, and we still use it today all the time. This can be true for the Bible as well -- there may be flaws in it, but that still does not as true as Harry Potter. Again, you misunderstand the analogy, and the text itself. Eternal torture and fire does not necessarily mean that there will be exactly as it describes. It is a analogy used for us to understand how we will feel about it, and what it may be similar to. If God is a just God, then he obviously will not hold people accountable for the things they have done if they do not know He exists. Again, you seem not to understand the analogy. Did you forget my point about how the son will go back to the slums by himself because the son cannot understand how to live in the high-life? God could beam us up to Heaven, but he would continually have to do so after we continue to do things which lead us to Hell. Isn't it much more elegant to have us learn so we need not depend on God in Heaven? And where does it say that when He forgives someone he still makes them suffer agony? The whole point of repentance is so you do not need to suffer agony, even after you make mistakes... As I said, it does not seem that you understand my analogy. First, what is unreasonable about it? All you did was give another example of it, but you did not prove that the argument is illogical. This is just basic statistics, but you would have a case if there was proof against the existence of God. but there is none, as there is no proof for the existence of God... My main point is that we cannot objectively say whether he exists or not. Next, where did you learn that Quantum Mechanics required the theory of relativity? The Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are two incompatible theories -- they contradict each other. Finally, you gave no proof to your allegations about the Bible, so what you are purporting is still invalid The Bible does not say that the Earth was created in 7000 years ago, please cite your source. This is not the core concept of Christianity, it is only a huge misconception spread by James Ussher.[1] But this still has nothing to do with the existence of God. And what do you mean for the ""chances of him existing""? There is absolutely no chance that he can exist, statistically, just as there is no chance that he can't exist. The existence of God has no place in statistics or science since there is absolutely no evidence for any hypothesis. I am a straight man, and I have nothing against gays either... but these things are really irrelevant to the debate. Please cite your source, where does it say that God hates homosexuals? Yes, I just said that faith and belief are irrelevant to science, please reread my post, you seem to misunderstand my point. You just said in your previous post ""I chose to believe in Science"" But belief is nonexistent in true science. Opinions also are irrelevant to science, as science isn't about the subjective thinking of opinions. You have plenty of misconceptions about the Bible: You believe that it says God is space-less and timeless. This is false, it only ever says he is timeless.[2] You believe that it says that you go to hell even after you repent. This is patently false, since there are numerous scriptures which tell us otherwise.[3] You believe that God can just beam people to Heaven. You perhaps do not know of the Laws of Justice and Mercy.[4] You believe that it says that the Earth is only 7000 years old. There is nothing which indicates this anywhere in the Bible You believe it says that God hates homosexuals. Again, there is no where in the Bible which says this. In this case, the Church is irrelevant. What does the Church's beliefs do with the existence of God? What church are you even talking about? About your first example, it still has nothing to do with whether or not God exists. This can happen, and God still may fully be within the possibilities of reality. As for your second example, I really do not see any logic in it whatsoever. This is what you said: God knows everything > He knows all your thoughts > therefore you cannot have free will. This makes no sense. You third example only rides on your own misunderstanding of God. He would allow this all to happen because he is testing us, because he wants us to learn and grow, and have an understanding of good and evil. It is perfectly reasonable for a evil world to be ruled by a good God, this only shows that he allows us to have free will. But none of these points disprove the existence of God. Any attack towards Christianity, or any other religion as a matter of fact, is futile, since the ideas of organized religion and God are not intimately connected. I.E. one does not require the other. We see this fact in theists who choose not to participate in any kind of organized religion.[5] My central point, is that we cannot say that God does exist, nor can we say he does not exist. God is outside an sort of proof or evidence. Either you accept Him, or you do not. Any argument against a religious sect, or against His actions do nothing to provide evidence against his existence. ---- 1. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. Isaiah 57:15 3. Revelation 2:22 4.

S9958d011-A32913a7b	Christianity is not real.	"Again, I have limited time, so I will make my post short. I thank Con for his arguments and indeed it has been an enjoyable experience so far. I will now rebut Con's argument. Con stated that there ""so few contradictions in the bible"" and that this fact is ""amazing"". Obviously I could not list every single contradiction in the bible because there are just way too many to mention. If I did, I would be well over the word count. I would also just like to ask Con for examples of his statement where he says ""extremely similar information about a person that nobody had a reason to believe in apart from being suicidal"". I think it would be possible to understand what you are talking about if you gave a source for your words. Con also stated that my argument about cutting your limbs off if 'they sin' was not a contradiction, and stated that it could have been a metaphor. He also asked ""who would be so mentally deluded to think that his foot can make him sin?"" Well, Jesus did, in the case of the Bible. If, however, what you say is true and this was a metaphor, who's to say that the entire Bible isn't just one big metaphor, never meant to be followed word for word? There is no way to prove that or to prove that one passage about cutting off limbs was a metaphor either. Now onto my own argument. I will explain some more ungodly incidences in the bible, just to make sure Con knows there aren't only three instances in the entire Bible. 1. Human Sacrifice, and animal sacrifice too [1] ""Take your son, your only son "" yes, Isaac, whom you love so much "" and go to the land of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will point out to you."" - Genesis 22:1-18 Wow. God is actually telling someone to sacrifice their son. For what reason? Later it was revealed it was just to test his fate - but he was told that by 'god' after he had tricked his son, made his son help him build the altar, tied his son down to the altar and held a knife to his throat. Has anyone ever considered how Isaac must have been feeling then? Terrified, nonetheless. Oh, and afterwards, god tells him to let Isaac go - and he asks him to sacrifice a ram instead. Animal cruelty! 2. General Immorality [1] ""If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her."" - Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT This is where Jesus says that women, if they are raped, must marry the man who raped her because they had relations to each other. He is obviously not at all taking into consideration how dangerous this could be for the woman. This is also very evident in the next quote: ""If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife."" - Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB So basically, here he is saying that if a man has relations with a woman who is already married, both of them should be stoned to death, even if it was in no way the woman's fault. How is this an act of a kind, just and fair God? 3. Slavery in the Bible [2] ""When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.""(Exodus 21:7-11 NLT) Nice. Well, this is what Jesus feels should be done to men's daughters. He is basically saying here that if a man sells his daughter as a slave, she cannot be freed after six years, like the men are 'allowed' to be; instead, if the man feels that he has not had her for long enough or feels he was not satisfied, he can keep her for even longer. Oh yeah, and also, he has not committed any sin as long as he has fed her, clothed her and satisfies her. Yep, that's definitely what a loving god would do! Would you like some more examples? Well here's one more, because I need to keep this short. If you would like any more, just go to my sources. 4. God is a jealous god - but he is good! (Apparently) [3] ""The LORD is a jealous God, filled with vengeance and wrath. He takes revenge on all who oppose him and furiously destroys his enemies! The LORD is slow to get angry, but his power is great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished. He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm. The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet. At his command the oceans and rivers dry up, the lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade, and the green forests of Lebanon wilt. In his presence the mountains quake, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles, and its people are destroyed. Who can stand before his fierce anger? Who can survive his burning fury? His rage blazes forth like fire, and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence. The LORD is good. When trouble comes, he is a strong refuge. And he knows everyone who trusts in him. But he sweeps away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He pursues his foes into the darkness of night."" Nahum 1:2-8 NLT Here, this passage is suggesting that natural disasters are a result of god's wrath. The first line says that god is a jealous god, filled with vengeance and wrath. Then later, it says that the lord is good. How is this possible? First, let's think logically; if god is jealous and filled with vengeance and wrath, and creates huge thunderstorms and tsunamis and droughts to kill people...is that a good God? Is that a God you would want? So I end this debate on that note. Voters, I ask you - would you want a type of God that allows women, men and children to die? That allows people to die for absolutely no reason? That kills animals just because he feels like it? That kills people on purpose for no particular reason? That discriminates against different races? That discriminates against homosexuals? Thank you Con for accepting my debate, and it has been a great experience. Voters, now it is up to you.

S9958d011-A983e6134	Christianity is not real.	"Round 4 | Rebuttal and Closing | by Eav | 14/11/14 I respect that Pro has only limited time available (actually most of us), but in the light of his fourth round arguments I want to remind everyone to stay focused on the resolution. [Rebuttal 3] Contradictions II [Rebuttal 4] Method Critique [Addressing Rebuttal 3] [Closing Statement] [R3] Contradictions II There is not much add, to what I said previously about contradictions in Round 3: That they are no clear sign for Jesus not existing. Faults or Misunderstandings in the bible don’t offer the conclusion that Jesus is made up and Pro has not provided any reasoning why that would be so, yet fully relies on that (not established) connection. I refer the reader to Round 3 – Fig. 1 and Rebuttal 2. But although they are meaningless for the resolution I will again spent some words on the given contradictions: 1. Animal cruelty; is not a contradiction but a point that can be morally questioned. How an unmoral Jesus is automatically a made up Jesus yet is never established and doesn’t make sense anyway: The existence of a person has nothing to do with their moral decisions. 2. Unfaithfulness and Rape, see upper explanation – this is not relevant. People who give questionable advice die and are born every day. 3. Slavery. Do I have to repeat myself? No contradiction and it’s also not ungodly. Because with the bible as religious text it’s probably not moral from our modern perspective but still in tune with gods will from the perspective of the bible. What is godly is defined by the religion that defines a god. If one doesn’t believe in god, one can’t say that something is ungodly, unholy or sin. 4. Good is jealous. Wordplay with our modern perspective of good and biblical understanding of this term. What is “good” is not automatically what the individual person considers good. From a religious perspective god is good to the extent that he always acts right and how is necessary. Or to quote the beginning of Footloose (1980): “He is testing us! He is testing us!” [R4] Method Critique 4a: Focus Shift Quote time: “Voters, I ask you - would you want a type of God that allows women, men and children to die? […] That discriminates against homosexuals?” (Pro, Round 4) This rampage against Christianity addressing the voter has nothing to do with the resolution, it’s asking for a biased vote based on Anti-Christian-Perspective. But this is no debate on the moral value of Christianity. To accept that Jesus was a historical person you don’t need to accept that he raised from the death or actually healed people (effectively). You don’t need to like or believe in Jesus (as the son of god) to accept he existed. 4b: Rephrasing Method My opponents Source Management shows lack of own thoughts, all his Sources are used in a paraphrasing matter meaning he extracts the whole argument from the website but uses his own words to repeat it. There is barely an independently developed thought in his arguments. 4c: Lack of Arguments Maybe it’s time for another diagram: (Fig 2) Pro has only two arguments: that the bible is immoral and inconsistent and that Jesus shows similarities to core people of other religions. Yet for four rounds he never addressed the problem that I pointed out in detail that neither one of these arguments stand in a proper relationship to Jesus existence. Nor has he shown on his own why there would be such a connection. Ergo Pro has presented two half-backed-not-his-own-theories. [AR 3] Contradictions 3a: “Extremely similar information” All four gospels share a significant amount of core events that they all mention and describe {5}. This means all gospel authors found more or less reliable but at least indicators to believe that the events they mentioned occurred. To say it otherwise: It’s too random to be strategically made up and it’s too connected to be just a coincidence. 3b: Metaphors in the bible “There is no way to prove that or to prove that one passage about cutting off limbs was a metaphor either.” (Pro, Round 3) Indeed, there is no way to answer that 100% but we can observe the passage and decide what is more reasonable and what makes most sense. We know that Metaphors are big part of the bible, in the old testament we have even problems using actions like ""eating"" or ""drinking"" consequently literal{6}. The word ""eye"" has been used before as a metaphore in the famous ""eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, [...]"" (Exodus 21:24), so this is another indicator. I would not even outrule that the use of the whole idea of eyes and limbs (foot/ hand) is a clear indicator that this is used in the same metaphorically manner as the exodus statement. And as the statement makes rather few practical sense if we not interpret it metaphorically (because sinning limbs rather a niche problem) the literal interpretation is less likely. Sources {5} http://www.bookofjesus.com... {6} http://www.biblesecrets.org... [Closing Statement] Pro repeatedly leaves the resolution in favour of pure Christianity bashing. Which is off topic and unnecessary. His argumentation doesn’t take changes in account that happened between the Years 100 BC to 100 AC and today for language, writing and understanding nature and morals and shows weaknesses at several points (R4). Around and shortly after the time of Jesus most likely existence people choose to be killed in his name, wrote about his doing mostly reporting about the same incidences and even those who had no reason to believe or foster believe in him choose to make a report of his existence that could have cost them their lives and their reliability as historians. All this indicates that a person was born, that was called Jesus or Christ (or probably something similar) that died and inspired a religion. Was he a god? Was he gods’ son? I don’t know and don’t need to know to answer the resolution in question with: Yes, Jesus existed. I thank my opponent as well for the debate and hand it over to the judges' will. Which might or might not be in my favour but hopefully not influenced by personal religious views. P. S. I am honsetly sorry that I mixed up who is Con and Pro in my previous round, but I am just not used to being Con on something ^^. But considering that Pro half-way-through forgot that I am not a guy seems to even the scores."	CON	694

Sa4352af2-Abd7d974a	The God of Classic theism is real	"I thank my antagonist for challenging me to this debate. Hopefully he will find it as entertaining as I do. In order to win this debate all I need to do is show why my opponent's arguments fail. However, I will go the extra mile by providing an argument for the plausibility of God's nonexistence. =====> A Critique of Lafayette_Lion's Opening Arguments <===== My opponent's main arguments (almost all of them) are clearly reliant upon circular reasoning. This type of erroneous thinking is best surmised in the following picture: http://theframeproblem.files.wordpress.com... Nevertheless, I will address the arguments one by one. Contention 0: John 1:1-5 demonstrates the existence of God. ""John 1:1-5… clearly defines the existence of God."" As stated earlier, this assertion is reliant upon circular logic. [1] Contention 1: If God does not exist, then who created us all? The premise of this argument is based on a false dichotomy. [2] Even if evolution weren't true, that would not prove that God exists. However, evolution is most certainly true. We know for a fact that humans and all other animals are related in terms of their ancestry. Among other strands of evidence for evolution, all animals share the same genetic coding, DNA. And we can use this code to compare the genetic sequences of any two species of animal in order to determine how closely related they are. As it turns out, humans share 98 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees [3], and we share less with our more distant cousins, elephants. Moreover, all of this genetic evidence helps form a beautiful hierarchical family tree among living creatures. We (homo sapiens) are but one twig on that tree, and we are related with every other living organism on the planet, including bacteria and plants. Contention 2: God is God This isn't even an argument. =====> The Case Against God <===== Contention 1: The Argument From Divine Hiddenness The argument from divine hiddenness, also known as the argument from non-belief, seeks to demonstrate the nonexistence of God by pointing out an inconsistency within the theistic worldview. I will only offer a brief sketch of it for now in this opening round. If God wanted humanity to know that he existed, as many theists often propose, then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him. As such, if God existed and God wanted us to know this, then reasonable non-belief should not occur. But reasonable non-belief does occur because God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, if he does exist. This, it would seem, entails a contradiction. The philosopher Theodore Drange sets forth a formal version of the argument in the following syllogism: 1. If God exists, God: (a) wants all humans to believe God exists before they die; (b) can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die; (c) does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and (d) always acts in accordance with what it most wants. 2. If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die. (From 1) 3. But not all humans believe God exists before they die. .: Therefore, God does not exist. (From 2 and 3) (Drange [4]) As can be plainly seen, the presence of reasonable unbelief presents a very real problem for the existence of God. The common religious response to this argument usually alludes to the notion that the ways of God are mysterious. However, this proposition flies in the face of the central doctrines surrounding theism. According to theism, God wants humans to have a relationship with him. Meanwhile, this God has also cloaked himself from the greatest tools and insights of modern science. Surely, any God that would bother to involve himself in the affairs of one primate species in a universe teeming with over 70 sextillion stars is not as inscrutable as all that. [5] ::Conclusion:: I have annihilated all of my opponent's current arguments. Unless he can formulate an argument that is logically valid and simultaneously dismantle my argument, then I will have won this debate by default.

Se8b34212-Ab4e16c77	God, heaven, and hell only exist metaphysically, not physically. Therefore, are only ideas.	"""Physical"" is something that can bee seen and touched. Certainly neither God nor heaven are ""physical"", at least in any sense we know. But first off how do you know that the physical actually exists at all? Edgar Allan Poe wrote: ""All that we see or seem is but a dream withing a dream."" While I certainly do not consider him an expert in the field I do not rule out that what he said is true. Science tells us that there is nothing ""physical"" about the atoms which make up everything. When magnified to its maximum the only thing that makes up a nucleus of an atom is a tiny ribbon of energy. Likewise your argument ignores the fact that certain things certainly DO exist that are far more than ""ideas"". I would place God in that category. But in it also are love, hate and a host of other things that transcend mere ""emotional"" response and can exist in reality. True love, not just the hormonal sense of attraction, undoubtedly does exist but is neither ""physical"" nor merely an ""idea"". If that is true of love why can it not be true also of God? You also overlook the possibility of the what we call ""real"" may not be the only thing that is ""real"". Scientists are in general agreement that there is the possibility of there being more dimensions than our 4. The acknowledge that there could be 11 or even more dimensions and each of those dimensions could have their own universe of which ours is only a tiny part just as a stick-man's two dimensional universe of the surface of the paper he is drawn on is a tiny part of ours. It opens the question as to whether or not God is in fact a multidimensional being. This is something which could only be caused ""supernatural"". Many scientists, even agnostics and atheists, have acknowledged the possibility of the ""supernatural"" and that an ""intelligence"" was behind the existence of our universe and ourselves. Atheist Stephen Hawking said: ""The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron "". The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been finely adjusted to make possible the development of life."" Agnostic astrophysicist and NASA scientist Robert Jastrow said: ""Astronomers now find they have painted themselves into a corner because they have proven, by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And they have found that all this happened as a product of forces they cannot hope to discover. That there are what I or anyone would call supernatural forces at work is now, I think, a scientifically proven fact."" More recently, two papers published last year also seem to indicate that. The first was in March in the premier scientific journal ""Icarus"" which essentially said that an intelligence WAS responsible for the programming of our DNA. http://www.evolutionnews.org... (note: while the link is to a source that certainly could be called ""biased"", the journal where it appeared certainly is not. Here is an abstract: http://www.sciencedirect.com... ). What that says about evolution I will leave, but it is obviously profound. But the fact is that it leaves us with only two logical choices: either the programming was done by an alien life form from within our universe or that it was a supernatural intelligence. The second paper was published in May as a result of a three year study in 20 countries done by Oxford University. It found that human beings are PREdisposed to believe in God and in an afterlife. http://www.ox.ac.uk... History and Archeology have proved that every culture everywhere no matter how primitive or isoloated have sought God in their own way. This has been shown to be true even of proto-humans. The fact that this was true from the beginning of mankind indicates that it is not a ""learned behavior"" for survival, but rather programmed into our DNA. As a result when you link this with the previous study of the two possible choices, an alien or supernatural intelligence, the one that seems most likely is the supernatural, for why would an alien culture program us to believe in God?"

S67121bf1-Ab0cc3ed	Religion Science and Philosophy should not be separated, they all point to a common and real truth.	I think that religion science Philosophy art and all other important studies and exploration to point to a real truth that should be enjoyed by everyone. A lot of people say that religion is fine art is fine science is fine but they don't normally agree and you shouldn't mix them and even more extreme people will speculate that what is true for you is not true for me and that truth its self is relative. If this is so then what is to come of us? If we simply create or own truth then why is the world not perfect, for us at least? And if there is not one real truth then there is no right and no wrong, no God and no salvation in any way you may need it. No point no Love peace and no freedom.

And in fact by saying that science religion philosophy and so on do not agree all of them being elements in mankind if they all point to different answers then only one can be right, but what about the thoughts and ideas of the ones that are said to be wrong? Aren't they just as credible? Doesn't there need to be a real true answer? Doesn't it all haft to point toward something?

To an atheist, it may seem far fetched. However, we should always keep our minds open to new things. Of course there are things that logical thinking may not need to even ponder on, but the existence is God shouldn't be just thrown away because of what the Bible says or what science says.

One person's belief doesn't make a god or religion real, just like me declaring that I have a right to a million dollars isn't as real as your right to a fair trial. We know that the great religions were not meant in a satirical way for at least two reasons. One, we know generally how religions emerged -- they wrote books on what they believed. Two, they produced things worthy of reverence -- whereas Pastafarianism doesn't have its own architectural style, musical style, etc. There aren't any devotional texts with gold leaf that took hundreds of man-hours to create dedicated to spaghetti. In conclusion, the whole Pastafarian metaphor is a straw man and tautology because you're substituting something obviously random and stupid for religion to show that religion is random and stupid."

My main problem with god is this, where is the proof? Many people search their whole lives to see him but they die trying, massive gathering to meet god has failed with no god comming down. Now i can guess you will start asking well where did you come from? which will eventually evolve into where did the earth come from? ending with where did the big bang come from? my answer to you is that is big bang was an anomoly, it was a tear in our universe thus gving it density which as Mr Hawkings has said is anti matter, thus it can also be seen as anti energy. The gravity was so big that to balance our original neutral universe massive amounts of the energy must be emmitted. So in math it can be seen like this, 5=5, -10000=-10000 or 5000=5000, when canceled out it is all zero. In the end it can all be put back to the original sate of nothing. And if you decide to ask me, where did that anomely come from, all i can say is that in the vast time of emptiness this was bound to happen sometime. But if you do not agree with that and persists that something HAD to be before that then i will simply ask you the question that no one is able to yet answer, what was before god? So i hope i see your reply soon comrade,	CON	702
S26a76b6b-A56970b2c	God is real	"Hello, it is a very nice day for a debate. You have posted several interesting arguments against the existence of God, and I will now respond to each of them in turn. You Said: ""Now god, what is god? Which god are you talking about? during what context are you reffering god to?"" My Reply: By God, I refer to a Being that is fully responsible for all of what we humans would call existence. I am talking about any and every version of God, as I believe they are all one and the same. You Said: ""My main problem with god is this, where is the proof? Many people search their whole lives to see him but they die trying, massive gathering to meet god has failed with no god coming down."" My Reply: I agree that there is no ""empirical"" proof for the existence of God. That does not necessarily mean that God does not exist. What constantly convinces me of God's existence is His undeniable role in shaping my life for the better( since you do not believe He is there, you wouldn't be interested in that) You Said: ""And if you decide to ask me, where did that anomaly come from, all i can say is that in the vast time of emptiness this was bound to happen sometime."" My Reply: I actually think that the Big Bang is a pretty logical theory. However, I don't agree that we have enough proof to rely on it. In my opinion, humankind is not nearly advanced enough to presume to know how the cosmos originated. I don't care how many scientists theorize otherwise. You Said: ""But if you do not agree with that and persists that something HAD to be before that then i will simply ask you the question that no one is able to yet answer, what was before god?"" My Reply: There is actually an easy answer for that; God exists outside of time. All of what we call dimensions(space, time etc...) were created by God for reasons unfathomable. This concept is nearly impossible for us humans to comprehend, as we are defined by the dimensions and can't exist in any other way."	PRO	703
S26a76b6b-Ae25c71bf	God is real	Okay comrade i will say what i think of your points, and i must say they are well said. You-By God, I refer to a Being that is fully responsible for all of what we humans would call existence. I am talking about any and every version of God, as I believe they are all one and the same. Reply-Well comrade that is your first flaw there are so many gods with different ideologies with different beliefs thus you cannot say they are all one and the same, You-That does not necessarily mean that God does not exist. What constantly convinces me of God's existence is His undeniable role in shaping my life for the better( since you do not believe He is there, you wouldn't be interested in that) Reply- is life really for the better? look at us, the average human beening is only pleased with his life 90% of the time is that shapig life for the better? We are never pleased with what we have, look at all the crime going on everyday all over the news. Thus i fail to believe the fact that he is shaping your life or anyones life for the better. You- I actually think that the Big Bang is a pretty logical theory. However, I don't agree that we have enough proof to rely on it. In my opinion, humankind is not nearly advanced enough to presume to know how the cosmos originated. I don't care how many scientists theorize otherwise. Reply- i am sure the proof given is sufficient, also if you say there is not enough proof of the big bang then isn't there less proof of god? You-There is actually an easy answer for that; God exists outside of time. All of what we call dimensions(space, time etc...) were created by God for reasons unfathomable. This concept is nearly impossible for us humans to comprehend, as we are defined by the dimensions and can't exist in any other way. Reply-If he does not live in our universe it means that he does not ablige to our rules, if he does not follow the rules in our universe then what are the point of the ten condemments and all the rules he has set for us, if as you said he is from another universe then whatever he said is made up and fake. If he is from our universe than you will need to either proof what is before him or that he does not exist and science has taken us up to the point. Look forwards to hearing from you again comrade.

Sa2c55adb-A485ad4ef	God is not real	"Does Time exist? Can we physically observe time? We can only see the effects of time....right. Does science support that time exists? Since God is disproved because of the fact that God can not be physically observed, then time should not exist. In Daniel 4:11, figurative language was used. Some people say skyscrapers ""touch"" the sky but they do not think the earth is flat... Some proof of heaven in the bible: Matthew 5:12 Luke 6:23 Revelation 22:12 Hebrews 11:26 Matthew 16:27 Daniel 12:3 Matthew 25:20-23 Luke 19:15-19 1 Corinthians 3:8 2 Corinthians 9:6 Matthew 5:10-12 Luke 6:22-23 1 Peter 5:4 1 Thessalonians 2:19 2 Timothy 4:8 Ephesians 2:6 Philippians 3:20-21 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 I will now use scientific proof: Many scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous explosion of energy and light known as the Big Bang. This was the start to everything that exists: the beginning of the universe, the start of space, and even the initial start of time itself. Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow, stated, ""The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in that first instant; every star, every planet and every living creature in the Universe came into being as a result of events that were set in motion in the moment of the cosmic explosion...The Universe flashed into being, and we cannot find out what caused that to happen."" Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in Physics, said at the moment of this explosion, ""the universe was about a hundred thousands million degrees Centigrade...and the universe was filled with light."" The universe has not always existed. It had a start...what caused that? Scientists have no explanation for the sudden explosion of light and matter. In Genesis 1:3, God said""Let there be light"". This is a logical explanation for the Big Bang. God accidentally created evil by creating us humans in a chain reaction. Should Hitler's parents be blamed for the holocaust? Life on earth is not important, if the children killed was innocent, then heaven will be given to them. GOOD ADVICE: WHEN TRYING TO DISPROVE BIBLE, DO NOT USE BIBLE!!!!!"	CON	706
Sa2c55adb-Ae758aeea	God is not real	"We created time to make it easier to explain when things will occur and date what has already,is, or will happen. We created God to make it easier to explain phenomenons science can't explain like ""miracles"" (for when they can explain them, what happens to God) and what happens after death. Daniel 4:11 could be figurative speech, but I doubt it. The reason I doubt it is because Christians actually believe Jesus changes the bread into the body and the wine into blood. It's called transubstantiation. Here's the definition: Transubstantiation (in Latin, transsubstantiatio, in Greek _6;^9;`4;_9;`5;`3;^3;`9;`3;_3;`2; metousiosis) is the change whereby, according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, the bread and the wine used in the sacrament of the Eucharist become, not merely as by a sign or a figure, but also in actual reality the body and blood of Christ. You see? ""...not merely as by a sign or a figure, but also in reality the body and blood of Christ"" That's illogical! If I were to take crackers, say a few Latin phrases over them, then Jesus's ACTUAL blood and ACTUAL body are suppose to appear? And we're suppose to eat it!?!? Looks like the bible encourages cannibalism too! That also proves my point that Daniel 4:11 is not figurative like you insisted, but they mean it literally just like with the bread and wine. Proving the bible says the Earth is flat. I like how you went from saying God doesn't creat evil as evil is the absent of good, to agreeing with me, but by now saying he ""accidently"" did it. He seemed pretty proud of himself and wasn't afraid to say it in Isaiah 45:7. For your thoughts on God creating the Big Bang: For many ""God caused the big bang"" is a perfectly reasonable response. This seems to help many cope with the unsatisfying prospect of an event without a cause. The problem of course is that one is then immediately forced to ask, ""From where did the creator come?"" If the answer is ""he always existed"" then we have a situation, from a causality standpoint, that is no more satisfying than a universe that springs forth from nothing. A creator that has always existed is an entity that somehow exists without a cause. So this answer doesn't solve the causality issue whatsoever. http://www.deepastronomy.com... Also, here insist it wasn't an actual ""bang"" The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expandswith time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion in space, but rather an expansion of space.[4] http://en.m.wikipedia.org... Okay, so there is scriptures in the bible that ""prove"" there is a heaven. Big deal. A book about HEAVEN should have scriptures about HEAVEN. This doesn't surprise me or interest me the slightest, as neither you nor I have been to heaven, and those people could not understand the complexity of heaven as they couldn't understand something as simple as a women's period. SPEAKING of that you ignored a few of my questions and points. 1.why is it God didn't understand a women's period, as he called it an abomination and told them to wash as if they were diseased? Is it because the people back then didn't understand it? I believe so... 2. Why does the bible have instances where God encouraged rape and slavery? Doesn't seem so omnibenevolent after all... But I already proved that in my first round! 3. What is one knowledgable thing in the bible that couldn't be solved by a common man back then, let alone today? No answer? Didn't think so. 4.You often talk about free will, but it never says that in the bible. It only talks about predetermination. Therefore people going against their will to choose not to follow God is false If we look at the bible as we have no free will! You failed to address these points even though I asked you to. One point you address is the Hosea 13:16 verse with the children. You are saying if the children are innocent,then life doesn't matter and they will have eternity in heaven. Get this through your head: YOU JUST SUPPORTED MURDER! and if I had to spend an eternity with the person who demanded I'd be killed, I would rather choose not to. By the way, thanks for the advice, but I think I did a fine job using it, and I'll continue to use it in other debates as it proves my points as much or more than yours. :)"	PRO	707
Sa2c55adb-A54e6dc9e	God is not real	"I never said science disproves God, I'm just saying it can't prove it either, just like it can't disprove the Easter bunny, flying spagetti monster, aliens like you said, or anything else supernatural. You talk about times God predicted something, I mean of course he predicted it, he's omniscient isn't he? You found that in the bible, and you know what's also in the bible? That the Earth is flat. In the bible they say the Earth is round, And every time they use round elsewhere in the bible they use it for a wheel, etc. round is not the same as a sphere. Also, it talks about how a tree from the center of the Earth will reach the heavens that everyone else on Earth could see it. Obviously, this is impossible if they were talking about a spherical earth, and they most have believed the earth was flat. Speaking of the bible, no where in the bible does it say we have free will. It says multiple times we are predetermined. That means every time God is ""testing"" us, he would already know what we would do and act, so their is no point in testing us. God doesn't allow evil, he creates it. He said so himself. If it is the devil and satans work, why doesn't he stop him? He is all powerful, he is omnipotent. Either he can't help us, so he's not omnipotent, or he chooses not to, so he's not Omnibenevolent. You said God killed all the evil creations and saved the Good ones. Why then, is it that he killed entire villages? It's hard to believe that everyone in that village was evil, what about the children and small/unborn babies? What about when everyone died of a great flood except for Noah and his crew? It's hard for me to believe everyone on the Earth at that time was evil. ""He is all powerful and can probably just make the Boulder disappear"". He's omnipotent, which means all powerful like I told you, so yes he could make it disappear. However, you said he could probably make it disappear, meaning you think he could creat a boulder big enough he could lift it, meaning he is not truly omnipotent."	PRO	708

Just because you've never seen him do it physically with your own eyes right in front of you doesn't mean he's nerer done it, I mean that is your belief on God and his works isn't it? Haha When I said the earth is flat, I'm aware that they never said it was. I'm saying that if you read the bible, which you've afmitted you've done several times, you can come to the conclussion they believe it is. I apologize for not giving the bible verse. It's Daniel 4:11, and to make up for not giving the verse earlier I will say it here(you may go and look it up if you'd like, I'll be reading the new living translation),""The tree grew very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see"". What proof do you have that they would go into heaven? You said evil is the absence of good, and God didn't create it, yet he himself said he created evil(look back at my first round argument Isaiah 45:7 KJV) You said man chose to not do God's will and chose to sin. Like I stated before, where in the bible does it state we have free will? It's states we are predetermined, but no where free will. If I'm wrong, please correct me, as you said yourself you've read the bible several times and should be able to prove or disprove my claim. Your verse, ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts..."" In Isaiah 55:8 is just an excuse for God to do horrific things and make them acceptable, like murdering the villages. Besides, while his ""thoughts"" are so much higher than ours, he sure did think like a man back in those days. Women were subjected to excile while menstratting and forced to wash as if they were diseased. He deemed it an abomination. That means God didn't understand something as simple as a women's period, the same thing men didn't understand back in those days. Also, back to the babies, why is it God specially calls for the murder of babies and unborn children? Hosea 13:16 (King James) Samaria will bear her guilt because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open. What's your excuse to that? Maybe it's because those children are the reproduction of those sinners, therefore they are apart of those sinners. With that said, you should support abortion if it was done by a rapist, since the rapist is a sinner and the baby will be the result of him. You would also support abortion if done by a couple that was not married, or even a meaningless hook up that ended up with one getting knocked up. This is a sin, as they had sex before marriage, therefore the baby would be the result of sinners so you would support the murdering of the baby. Do you agree with abortion? You shouldn't, that's not the Christian thing to believe and support. However, that's basically what you are saying by supporting God killing the villages and innocent people. Why is it that God allows rape and slavery? Give me one knowledgeable thing God said in the bible that couldn't be solved by a common man back then(and the fall of those empires you listed above could of been predicted by a man, that's only a matter of time thing)."

Sa2c55adb-Ae50411a8	God is not real	"It's hard for me to believe in something that has so many contradictions. Did you know that's Gods own definition contradicts itself? The definition of God in the Christian Bible is that he is 1.Super natural 2.Omnibenevolent 3.OmniPotent 4.Omniscient I'll start off with the first one. Now, being supernatural means you are inmaterial, which means it can't be tested as in science you can only test material things. With that said, you couldn't prove for a supernatural being to be right or wrong since you can not test it. With that said, you say God is the higher power, while I say Zeus, and another one says a flying spaghetti monster. As ridiculous as that sounds, you can't prove one to be more right or wrong than any other one, therefore all 3 answers are equally valid. The second one is God is Omnibenevolent or all good. Now let's use examples of horrible things: War, disease, natural disasters, almost anything bad you can think of. Now, do you think that is the work of God, or the devil? If you said God, that proves you disagree in the defintion of God. If you said it's the devil, you are also wrong. God says In Isaiah 45:7 KJV, ""I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things"". He says himself he creates evil, proving he is not all good, contradicting his own definition. The next one is Omnipotent or all powerful. Now here's a question in which you've most likely heard before but stands true and proves my point. Can God create a boulder so big even he himself could not lift it? If you say God can, that proves he is not Omnipotent since he is not powerful enough to lift the Boulder, and if you say God can't them that proves he is not omnipotent as he could not create a boulder so big. The last part of this definition is he is Omniscient or all knowing. If God knew everything, then he would know what you need or what you want, and therefore there should be no reason to pray for it."	PRO	711

Aliens can exist BUT, you can not test that. The origin of humans is from a theory and evidence in our world doesn't 100% support evolution. God allows evil in the world because of free will and letting us choose our destiny. God does not want us sinning but, humans choose to sin against GOD. War, disease,natural disasters, etc. are not made by God's doing... IT IS SATAN'S. Satan managed to trick Eve and Adam to sin thus causing creating evil. Sin brings along greed, lust, pride, gluttony, envy, sloth, and wrath. Another evidence that supports God is just and good is that he punishes Satan, Adam, and Eve for their sin. During Noah's time, almost all humans were evil and God was sorry for ever making humans. If God is not Omnibenevolent, why would he kill of his evil creations and save the good creations. He is all powerful and can probablly just make the boulder disappear. There is no need to pray because he knows everything but, praying connects you with God more.	CON	712
Se0dac00a-A45630ecf	Evolution is real	Since these are all points (except creation and the Big Bang, which are both irrelevant) I am simply going to copy, paste and reword part of my arguments from my other debate, just for my own sanity. As for macro evolution This article ( http://scienceblogs.com...... ) explains exactly that, I am not going to go through the whole process, it would take too long, but it is basically a process of mistake and error in the process of mistake and error by the part of your body that can happen causing one of the sides to have missing sections that are added on to another part of the DNA. If you need clarification on what I am talking about, the link is right there if you want to read it. (Here is some more evidence macro evolution exists that I found while searching for proof of a common ancestor http://www.talkorigins.org...... ) Here is an article attempting to prove there is a common ancestor: http://www.scientificamerican.com...... this article basically says that having one common ancestor is 10^2,860 more likely to be what happened than the next most likely theory (the one you proposed in your last statement). Does this prove with complete certainty? No, but it is such a big likelyhood that it may as well be rounded to 100% and call it a day. Micro evolution does not prove macro evolution, but what I have stated above is how it would work AND a scientific study that proved with practically complete certainty that that is what happens.

I have already proven macro evolution to be so near to fact that it is as sound as saying that I can see my hands when I look at them with sufficient light. 2. you list no sources and use no evidence to back up your claims. 3. There was no life for at least just less than 1 billion years after earth existed. I cannot tell you where exactly cells came from, I wasn't there, there are many theories, one is that it was an acidental process, a coincidence of circumstances (which surprisingly makes sense, because of the size of the universe), another theory is that an organism piggybacked itself on an asteroid that hit the earth. I personally don't care which you believe, even if you believe that god created the original life on earth, because where it came from matters little, because their is sufficient evidence In my last statement that there was most likely one shared ancestor between all life on earth. I can look at animals and say their bodies were made imperfectly, I can do that by simply looking at the human body, think about it, and you can find many imperfections. Why are the veins and nerves so close to the surface of the skin? That's one thing I would like you to argue to be perfect, because it isn't. Made incorrectly? Ya, our bodies are biologically PROGRAMMED to self destruct, we have genes that tell us to die, and that prevent us staying youthful, and you call that correct? I know, population control and all, but really? I would argue it COULD come from some random cell, I would suggest you stop making your statements seem like you feel like you are 100% correct. Look at the way the earth turns? What does that mean? And how? Yes, the earth turning is fantastic, but that proves nothing, something being beautiful proves nothing. Death can be beautiful too, does death prove there is a god? No! The Big Bang is what creates gravitational force by the way, if you ask me how I will link you to an article on it, but that isn't what this debate is about (just going to point out that it was the church that actually originally denied gravity completely, just saying) I agree, nothing can come from nothing, but what's your point? And how does you going on to gravity accomplish anything? It's evolution we are discussing, not gravity or how the universe began. I agree you cannot make an apple appear, but I again don't see your point, I am not discussing how the universe began, and for good reason. It matters very little how the universe came to exist, the facts we know from science are still facts, and can still be repeatedly proved by the same experiment. Stuff stays the same in the universe whether you believe in the Big Bang, or if you believe god created everything.	PRO	715

If the Bible, for example, said, ""On the first day of the first month in the year two thousand and ten, the pillars of the earth will shake and a great part of the New World will be lost to the sea,"" and then January 1, 2010 comes and a tremendous earthquake sends California to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, I would become a believer. No points are awarded under any of the following conditions: If the prophecy is vague, unclear or garbled (like Nostradamus' ramblings, for example). It must be detailed, specific and unambiguous in its prediction and wording. If the prophecy is trivial. Anyone could predict that it will be cold next winter, or that this drought/plague/flood will eventually subside. The prophecy must predict something surprising, unlikely or unique. If the prophecy is obviously contrived for other reasons. No official seer or court astrologer ever predicted that the king he worked for would be a brutal, evil tyrant who would ruin the country. If the prophecy is self-fulfilling; i.e., if the mere fact of the prophecy's existence could cause people to make it come true. The Jewish people returned to their homeland in Israel just as the Bible said they would, but this isn't a genuine prediction - they did it because the Bible said they would. The predicted event can't be one that people could stage. If the prophecy predicts an event that already happened and the writing of the prophecy itself can't be shown to have preceded the event. If the prophecy predicts an event that already happened and the happening of that event can't be verified by independent evidence. For example, Christian apologists claim that Jesus fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies, but the authors of the New Testament obviously had access to those prophecies also; what would have prevented them from writing their story to conform to them? The extra-biblical evidence for the existence of Jesus is so scanty that it is impossible to disprove such a proposal. And finally, if the prophecy is the lone success among a thousand failures. Anyone can throw prophecies against the wall until one sticks. The book or other source from which it comes must have at least a decently good record on other predictions. These conditions, I think, are eminently reasonable, and are only what would be expected of a true prophet with a genuine gift. Scientific knowledge in holy books that wasn't available at the time. If the Bible (or any other religious text) contained some piece of knowledge that the people of the time couldn't possibly have known but that is now known to be true, that would be highly convincing to me. A passage about the atomic theory of matter or the heliocentric solar system would be interesting, but not conclusive, since the Greeks, for example, proposed those ideas long ago independent of any claim to divine revelation. A mention of the theory of evolution would have been impressive. A reference to the germ theory of disease, or the laws of electromagnetics, would have been compelling. But what would be indisputable proof would be an elucidation of a truly modern theory of physics, such as relativity or quantum mechanics - not just something that the people of the time couldn't possibly have known of, but something so counter-intuitive that the odds against guessing at it correctly would be staggering. Just think: What if Jesus had said something like this? ""Verily, verily, I say unto thee that thine energy is as thine mass times the speed of light multiplied unto itself."" Of course people of the time would have been baffled, but just imagine how many souls it would have saved today. As with the prophecy item, there must be independent verification that the piece of knowledge was written in texts that existed well before it was actually discovered by science. Miraculous occurrences, especially if brought about through prayer. If cities condemned as sinful by preachers tended to explode in flames for no apparent reason, if glowing auras of holy light sometimes appeared around believers to protect them from harm, or if atheists and only atheists were regularly struck by lightning, this would be compelling proof. But it wouldn't have to be so dramatic; even minor but objectively verifiable miracles would do, especially if they could be invoked by prayer. If a hospital did a double-blind study to determine if intercessory prayer helps the sick, and it was discovered that only the patients prayed for by members of a certain religion experienced a dramatic, statistically significant increase in recovery rate, and this result could be repeated and confirmed, I would convert. This one shouldn't be so hard, especially for the Christians - after all, Jesus told them that they would be able to work miracles through prayer! Any direct manifestation of the divine. I'm not that hard to convert; I'll be happy to believe in God if he tells me to in person, as long as he does it in such a way that I could be sure that it was not a hallucination (for example, in the presence of multiple reliable witnesses, none of which are in a highly emotional or otherwise altered state). Where are the voices speaking out of burning bushes, or out of thin air when people get baptized? In Old Testament times, Moses saw God so often that he knew him on a first-name basis. Why doesn't this happen any more today? Aliens who believed in the exact same religion. And one more, though this one is just a bit off the wall. If humanity was to contact an extraterrestrial civilization, and if said extraterrestrials had a religion that was exactly like some religion on Earth, I would become a believer. (Though it would raise some interesting theological problems for Christians. Does Jesus have to travel to every planet in the universe individually, dying and being resurrected on each one?) The second category deals with things that would not be conclusive, but that would count as circumstantial evidence. Show me one of these and I might not convert right away, but your religion will look a lot better to me. A genuinely flawless and consistent holy book. True inerrancy is, so to speak, the holy grail of theism. Almost every religion claims their scripture is perfect, but none that I know of have actually met this exacting standard; I have yet to read a holy text entirely without error or self-contradiction. A book that was free of such problems would be circumstantial evidence in favor of the religion that possessed it, but not compelling, since this is still explicable as the result of purely human forces. A religion without internal disputes or factions. It seems reasonable to expect that, if there existed a god that was interested in revealing itself to humanity and desired that we follow its commands, that god would write down whatever instructions it had to give us in a way that was only amenable to one interpretation. Thus, if a religion was true, we might expect that no factions or sects would form within it and all members of that religion would speak with one voice regarding ethical and theological issues. Why the alternative scenario should ever hold for an inspired religion is not clear. Did God intend to communicate his message clearly but failed to do so? However, since this could still be the result of human influence, it would only be circumstantial, not conclusive, evidence in favor of a given religion's truth. A religion whose followers have never committed or taken part in atrocities. If a given religion's sacred text consistently promotes peace, compassion and nonviolence, and if that religion's history reflects that fact, that religion would look much more attractive to me."

At first glance this may seem to prove that a name is not a unique title to represent the individual. We may ask our selves: ""how can this possibly be a definition of me, if someone else invented it?"" In reality, we define our names, and appropriate them and make them our own. The actual vocalization of the name is, in the grand scheme, irrelevant. The important factor is that they are unique, so that they may become an individual title for us. I assert that it is, for the most part, irrelevant who invents the actual vocalization of the name."" So if there is no real individuality to a name except what we make of it, this entire debate is moot. Since you have openly admitted to me that we cannot be individual based on our names, the concept of a name pool has no relevence on individuality whatsoever. ""In fact, some people have gone as far as to try and outline all of these real names, such as this site: http://www.babynames.com....... While many of these names are lesser known, and would be considered to be fake, by many people, it certainly proves that there is a perceived pool of real names."" So then, who's to say what's absurd or unindividual about this. It is a farce to believe that the sole purpose of a site is to suggest names for a person without consulting the creator first. This, in itself, would prove that they made it with the intent you described. ""Yes, there are some people who give their kids names completely of their own conception(like you said, as a result of the pool of names), but this is extremely rare. This does not have any serious impact however. As we have seen, there IS a perceived pool of real names, yet still people insist on choosing a name from this list, rather than creating one."" So, from what you've said, it sifts those who actually use their creativity and individuality therefore, if one rarely uses creativity, it would affect the name of their baby, not the name pool. ""Yes, but how often are names being ""made""? The vast majority of society (and since the subject of this debate is society, we should focus on society) is only re-using names from the pool of real names. The common trend is not to enlarge the pool of names, but to pick from the names already there. The notion of having a pool of names in the first place is positively ridiculous. It is silly to choose a name held by millions of people not associated with your self. ..."" I am rather confused. Did you not say the name has no relevance on a person's individuality? From this paragraph down, you speak of a name as if it is the only description, rather than personality reigning over a name. ""Yes, I understand the hypothetical and see your point, but this scenario is probably very rare. "" Perhaps with the name Steve but several of my friends had given birth and named their child only to find out that the name had been created before hand. My opponent has gone in two different directions. One, he says our names represent us. Then, in his R2, he claims that the names hold no relevance besides putting a name to the personality. From half of his speech down, you see the logical fallacy in his debate. My opponent has dropped and/or agreed with my points. Now, let's recap: 1)A ""Name Pool"" can help promote individuality (As my opponent has agreed to) 2) People who generally have a creative mind generally will use it. 3) A name holds no relevance except to give a correlation between a picture or idea with a vocalised word.

The first human, Adam, couldn't have just made up a bunch of sounds and made sense out of them. It takes a special intelligence to even be able to function properly, or at all! Look at the human body: the eye, heart, and all of the 100 trillion cells that are in our body. It's all so incredible that just us ourselves are complete evidence for a God!

An example of this is Martin Luther who translated bible which was only in Latin at the time into German, this was one of the first times that common people could read the book and interpret the words for themselves. In this regard the Roman Catholic Church was able to control the masses against charge them a fee for repentence, making the church one of the wealthiest organisations still to this day. Now to your examples of that everything in the world was made by an all powerful creator, every point you made in those examples can be explained by evolution. The reason man learned to speak is that we have evolved to communicate with words, this is why language changes, and words and their meanings change. If an all powerful being made everything, surely he would have made it all perfect the first time! Cells do not stand as a reason for God either, the fact that we change our cells constantly stands as an explanation for evolution, and our ability to pass on genetics to our children and changes will occur in their genes to better suit the environment that we are living in. Another point to be made is if a God made everything, why would he allow things that he made destroy the world and the environment.

This means humans actually predate the God you are talking about, by around 50 000 years of found of evidence of life. I believe it is a great thing that you 'have a God that loves you unconditionally' but you should be able to love yourself unconditionally and be a good person without the need of a supernatural being. If you believe that regardless of what happens in this life that you will find yourself in the most beautiful afterlife, then you are not allowing yourself to reach your full potential whilst you are alive. This means you are not acting in the best way all the time because regardless what happens you goto heaven. Or you belief that you can suffer in poverty or mistreatment because at the end of your life you will have everything you desire. It is for these reasons that 'God' is used to suppress people, and thus religion has always been targeted at people who are down and out.

S74fdcbb5-A267434ce	God Is Not Real	"My opponent states that ""the cause of the existence of the universe is The Big Bang."" The problem here is that my opponent doesn't understand what the Big Bang is. The standard Big Bang model actually supports the fact that the Universe had a beginning. But the cause of the Big Bang still has to be eternal, omnipresent, and etc...Basically, God (as my opponent defined in Round one) meets the requirements to be that cause. Then my opponent states that ""the Bible states that God has always existed, so he never began to exist, which means he needs no creator. The problem with this argument is that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that supports this claim and using Bible verses to prove that God has always existed is ridiculous."" The main thing here is that my opponent asked me in Round two to prove the Christian interpretation of God. And that God is by definition eternal. So technically, I don't have to prove that the Christian God is eternal. That said, I did end up proving that the cause of the Universe had to transcend time since it created time. In other words, the cause of the Universe is in fact eternal. So if we go back to round two we see that my argument shows that the cause is eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent, creative, personal, moral, and etc...And these attributes perfectly match the ones the Christian God has. While this could be used to argue for other Gods, that is why the second argument about Jesus was presented. My opponent then says ""that without a God, morality is subjective. Assuming a God does not exist, morals are a societal construct, or a set of ideas that most people agree on. The ideas are not bad ideas, but they are designed by humans."" That is quite true. You have to deny the existence of objectively (meaningful) morality if you deny the existence of God. But it is also quite clear that an objective moral law does exist. For example, everyone knows that murder, stealing, etc...are wrong. In other words, we are all aware that a moral standard exists. For example, when someone trips you as you walk on a train, you get angry since they have done something wrong. The point is that we all know the basic moral principles. Here is a video that restates what I just said: https://www.google.com... I usually use the moral argument in these debates but I decided to mix things up this time. My opponent then points out that ""claiming to be an all-powerful, omnipotent being, and actually being an all-powerful, omnipotent being are very different things."" The problem here is that my opponent didn't address my point. His brothers (originally not believers), friends, and people that knew him said that he was God. This is significant. Then it is said that ""it is possible to be wrong, without being a madman, and it is possible to lie, without being an evil person."" I completely disagree. You can't be a good teacher and literally insane at the same time. The historian named Josephus called Jesus a good teacher and there is no way you can be a good teacher and be insane at the same time. As for lying, you cannot lie and then say that you aren't evil. Anyone who has ever done something wrong is bad/evil (to different degrees). We are kind of like fruit, when we do something wrong, we bruise and are no longer perfectly good. As for homosexuality, my opponent claimed that people were born gay. Now it seems that he has retracted that claim and has instead said that ""even though the 'gay gene' has not been found yet, in a study of 409 pairs of gay brothers, it was found that every test subject shared the same five SNPs."" Basically, nothing has been proven. That said, even if there was a gay gene, this wouldn't mean that people were forced to be Gay. There are also genes that cause people to be overweight but this isn't an excuse to not take care of their bodies. Then my opponent uses an emotional argument which goes as follows: ""there were approximately 3 million Polish Christians executed in Nazi concentration camps. These Christians could have prayed to God all day, but their deaths were part of God's plan, and the prayers did not affect anything."" The problem here is that my opponent is asserting a lot here. Prayer is the act of talking to God. I don't see why the camps would prevent them from doing that. That said, I am guessing my opponent means that no matter how much those specific people might have prayed for survival ended up dying anyway. This is not God's fault but it is the fault of the Nazis. So instead of blaming the creator, blame the bad people who make bad choices. The Christian God promises his followers eternal life which will make any suffering on earth look like nothing. Though...this is off topic since it has nothing to do with proving God's existence. Then evolution was brought up again by my opponent. I understand that he believes in the process of evolution but this debate isn't supposed to be about evolution. Like I have already said, evolution is only a fact if we are talking about adaption. But common ancestry is not a fact and my opponent hasn't even tried to show any evidence supporting that type of evolution. I have already admitted that evolution is incompatible with Christianity so my opponent doesn't have to keep asserting that. That said, the Bible makes no claim on the age of the earth so his claim about the Bible saying that the earth is 6,000 yrs old is just plain wrong. But again, none of this is relevant to the topic at hand. As for scientific theories, I understand the scientific definition of a theory. When you define a theory in that way, then theories can become facts. But evolution is only correct at a very basic level. Then my opponent claims that the evolution of E. coli bacteria has been observed. Again, the bacteria was adapting in these tests. E coli did grow big after mutations and it did exchange genetic material. But the e coli never became anything other than e coli. So this wouldn't count as macro-evolution (the type some Christians have issue with). Basically, the experiments showed the bacteria adapting but nothing about what happened was game changing. The bare assertions at the end were quickly responded to. Again, cosmology supports the existence of God, the gospels are proof of the miracles Jesus did, and the evidence for God is plenty but this debate is not big enough to address all of these issues. My understanding was that this debate was solely about the Christian God's existence. I presented two arguments in round two and they have not exactly been responded to. A little was said about the cause being the Big Bang but that statement was refuted in this round. This debate has turned into a Christian answering question after question about different topics such as God's existence, evolution, homosexuality, suffering, and etc...I don't actually mind this, but I just wanted to point out that most of what my opponent writes is not quite on topic."

S74fdcbb5-A47153d40	God Is Not Real	"The cosmological argument: The argument states that God is timeless. If there is an intelligent being, that exists outside of time, that being cannot think, or do anything. Thinking and doing require change, and change requires the passage of time. A timeless being that can do anything is a self-contradictory idea. If time began at the same time as the universe did, then there was no point in time where the universe did not exist, as they came into existence at the same time. The universe has technically always existed. The word ""always"" is not defined as an infinite amount of time, the word only applies within the confines of time. If something is as old as time itself, like the universe, it has always existed, and therefore needs no cause, or creator. My opponent states, ""The main thing here is that my opponent asked me in Round two to prove the Christian interpretation of God. And that God is by definition eternal. So technically, I don't have to prove that the Christian God is eternal."" I understand that the Christian interpretation of God claims that God is eternal, but it fails to back up these claims. My opponent states, ""You have to deny the existence of objectively (meaningful) morality if you deny the existence of God."" Objective is not a synonym of meaningful. Morality is subjective. If morality were objective, everyone would share the same moral opinions. If our morals were taken directly from the Bible, adulterers would be stoned, no one would eat bacon, and trimming your beard would be seen as immoral. I am going to assume that you, at least once, have trimmed or shaved your facial hair, seeing as your profile states that you are a 19-year old male. This would mean that you are an immoral person. A person's moral views are influenced by what century they live in. Over the course of human history, moral views have become more liberal. Charles Darwin was quite liberal for his time, as he disapproved of slavery, and denied God's existence, yet today he would be seen as very conservative, and racist, as he still thought that coloured people were of less value than white people. My opponent says that, ""But it is also quite clear that an objective moral law does exist. For example, everyone knows that murder, stealing, etc...are wrong. In other words, we are all aware that a moral standard exists."" These are moral standards that exist today, but they did not exist in the past. Early human tribes saw murder and stealing within their own tribe as immoral, but the stealing from, and murdering of other tribes was an acceptable thing to do. Human morals have changed as we have learned that working together, instead of killing each other is more productive, and beneficial to us. My opponent says, ""His brothers (originally not believers), friends, and people that knew him said that he was God. This is significant."" Eyewitness testimonies should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are just one person's word against another person's. People who disagreed with these testimonies would have been left out of the Bible. You are accepting that these testimonies are true without any evidence that they are. Eyewitness testimonies are often very inaccurate. (http://www.scientificamerican.com...) My opponent then says, ""I completely disagree. You can't be a good teacher and literally insane at the same time."" You have misunderstood what I said. I said that Jesus could have just been lying, and not insane. You say that, ""As for lying, you cannot lie and then say that you aren't evil."" I will assume that you have lied, at least once, as every human has. Are you saying that you are evil? My opponent says, ""This is not God's fault but it is the fault of the Nazis."" The Bible claims that God decides when we die. (Job 14:5) If this is the case, the Nazis were only fulfilling God's will. My opponent states, ""Like I have already said, evolution is only a fact if we are talking about adaption."" There is evidence of common ancestry. All cells are put together in the same way. Humans share 96% of our DNA with chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. (http://news.nationalgeographic.com...)

Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide. My opponent says, ""Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence."" The cause of the existence of the universe is The Big Bang. The Bible states that God has always existed, so he never began to exist, which means he needs no creator. The problem with this argument is that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that supports this claim and using Bible verses to prove that God has always existed is ridiculous. Then my opponent states that, ""Since the cause of the Universe has to be...Moral-the cause of the universe led to the existence of morality."" The problem with this is that without a God, morality is subjective. Assuming a God does not exist, morals are a societal construct, or a set of ideas that most people agree on. The ideas are not bad ideas, but they are designed by humans. I do not deny the existence of Jesus, I only deny the existence of his miracles. You said that, ""Jesus claimed to be God and his friends and his brothers claimed that he was God."" Claiming to be an all-powerful, omnipotent being, and actually being an all-powerful, omnipotent being are very different things. You clearly agree with the quote from C.S. Lewis that you used. The quote states, ""Either this man was, and is, the son of God: or else a madman or something worse."" This is the mad, bad, or God argument. The problem is, it is possible to be wrong, without being a madman, and it is possible to lie, without being an evil person. Therefore, it is possible that Jesus was mad, bad, God, lying, or just wrong. There is some evidence of homosexuality being a genetic trait. Even though the ""gay gene"" has not been found yet, in a study of 409 pairs of gay brothers, it was found that every test subject shared the same five SNPs. The SNPs were clustered in the Xq28 region of the X chromosome and in the 8q12 region of chromosome 8. (http://www.the-scientist.com...-/) There were approximately 3 million Polish Christians executed in Nazi concentration camps. These Christians could have prayed to God all day, but their deaths were part of God's plan, and the prayers did not affect anything. The recurrent laryngeal nerve takes the same route in humans. I used the example of the giraffe because I felt that the length of the giraffe's neck emphasized my point. In fish, the same nerve travels from the brain, past the heart, and attaches to the gills of the fish. As evolution progressed, the neck extended and the heart lowered, and the nerve was caught on the wrong side of the heart. Evolution is incompatible with Christianity. If the Bible is to be taken literally, and nowhere in the Bible does it claim to be a series of figurative stories, life began 6000 years ago and everything was intelligently designed. Evolution is the idea that life has evolved over millions of years, slowly becoming more and more advanced, and changing due to unintelligent genetic mutations. These ideas directly contradict each other. The definition of scientific theory is: a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation. In science, if an idea was originally proposed as a theory, it can never become a law, even if it is proven. The idea that that some diseases are caused by microorganisms is still called The Germ Theory, even though we can see physically see germs under microscopes and The Germ Theory has been proven. I would like to point out that evolution has been observed. In a study that has been ongoing for 27 years, scientists have observed the evolution of E. coli bacteria. The researchers found that after 20 000 generations the surviving cells had 45 mutations that gave them an evolutionary advantage, as the Theory of Evolution predicts.

S28feca15-Ad1cd3192	Free Will is Real and Compatible with Determinism	"Determinism Versus Free Will: The Difference is Options In the determinism versus free will debate, determinists believe causality and choice are mutually exclusive – while compatibilists believe they are intimately intertwined. I will attempt to present a rational argument for my particular brand of compatibilism. Mine is a unique (I can't find my central tenet repeated by anybody else on the Internet) and forceful argument that explains how free will is compatible with determinism without contradicting it in any way. Divergent Assertions: Determinism asserts that causality is responsible for all events of the past, present and future. At the beginning of time, the Prime Mover kick-started this universal cascade of cause and effect. To most theists, the Prime Mover is God. To most atheists, the Prime Mover is the (inflationary model) Big Bang. Compatibilism asserts that free will is compatible with determinism and that choice is its sole essential requirement. The central tenet of my particular brand of compatibilism emphasizes the observable and scientifically verifiable fact that animate beings respond to cause and effect differently than does inanimate matter. The ramifications of this fact holds the key to free will. Many determinists vehemently deny this fact because they sense it threatens their dogma. It doesn't. Free will is compatible with determinism without undermining determinism itself. I'll elaborate on this point, below (under, ""Compatibilism – Logical Conclusions""). Determinism – Logical Conclusions: Determinism is all about causality: cause and effect. Causality governs the physical laws that rule the universe. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Not only does effect always follow cause – the effect is always 100% predictable in every detail. In other words, for every action, there is only one possible reaction. Outside the quantum realm, causality is inerrant. Determinism allows no uncaused effects. This means that if you could gather and understand all factors extant in a closed system (such as the universe) at a specific point in time, it would be possible to extrapolate, with absolute certainity, the state of that closed system at any other point in time (past, present or future). Not only is the state of the closed system predictable, but every factor within the system is also predictable – extending even to our acts and thoughts. Let's take a look at what happens when we take determinism to its logical conclusion. Since the dawn of civilization, mankind's greatest, most monumental, achievements all required the planning and coordination of man-hours, brain-power, material resources, engineering and construction, etc. World Wars I and II are other examples of colossal efforts, logistics and events that (arguably) eclipse our greatest achievements. Take any of these, or all of them, and put them in a deterministic context. In a deterministic context, the events of these achievements and wars were scripted at the beginning of time. Every last imaginable detail – even the thoughts of those involved – has always been predetermined. Wait a minute . . . doesn't the Old Testament and Quran make the same claims? Hmmm, just a coincidence, I guess. Not! Hell, with a 13.75 billion year-old script so detailed, specific and inerrant, you might as well say God wrote it. With absolute determinism, we don't have the slightest chance of exerting any influence on our own lives. We are at the mercy of destiny. Not as appealing as creating your own destiny . . . but better than no destiny at all. May the force be with you. Compatibilism – Logical Conclusions: Free will and compatibilism have gotten a bum rap because of dogmatic materialism: a physical doctrine that denies the clear distinctions between inanimate matter and animate beings. For some reason, most determinists don't (or won't) acknowledge the differences between a living being and a lifeless rock. I must confess: I was reciting determinist dogma whan I stated, earlier, that ""Not only does effect always follow cause – the effect is always 100% predictable in every detail. In other words, for every action, there is only one possible reaction."" That statement is actually false. The truth is: it is only inanimate matter that has only one possible reaction to an action. Inanimate matter has NO options. Animate beings, on the other hand, react to causality with an entirely different mode of response. For every action encountered by an animate being, there is NOT just one possible reaction: there are variable numbers of reactions. In other words, with animate beings, causality leads to options – NOT a single, immutable, reaction. Unlike inanimate matter, animate beings have options. I'm not certain that cause and effect, as a scientific prinicple, was ever formally extended to, or meant to include, living creatures. Regardless, the animate mode of response violates no laws of nature: it was introduced by, and is part of, the phenomenon called ""life"" – and I think we can all agree that life is quite natural. If the prevailing view of causality includes animate beings, without recognizing the animate mode of response to cause and effect, then it's the prevailing understanding of causality – not causality itself – that is false. If so, our understanding of causality needs to be expanded to acknowledge the animate mode of response to causality. It's not as if causality, as an absolute, has to apply to everything. We already know that causality does NOT apply, at all, to the quantum realm; so it's positively NOT true that absolute causality applies to everything. Living beings, therefore, set no precedents by responding differently to causality. Causality produces variable potentials (causal options) when it encounters an intelligence with mastery over causality. The advent of life introduced motility to the universe. Motility is simply the ability to move without the influence of an external force. Even single-celled organisms can move to avoid harsh or noxious conditions. The significant difference is that the movement is NOT 100% predictable. Unlike inanimate matter, there is more than just one direction the organism can take. Nor will identical organisms move identically under identical conditions. This is an undeniable departure from the precisely predictable reactions of inanimate matter. Motility is just one obvious factor distinguishing animate beings from inanimate matter. Consciousness and intelligence are also factors. Their complex contributions introduce more variables, giving us more options to consider. Options are what it's all about . . . because options mean choices and choices means free will. Options and choice are as natural to intelligent beings as their lack is to inanimate objects. Animate beings need not react like inanimate objects in order to qualify as natural: that would be downright unnatural. Think about it! A natural function of intelligence is to choose from the options that causality continually presents us. Our intelligence allows us to extrapolate causality into the future so that we can predict which option should be best to choose . . . and, therefore, guide our own ""causal paths"". This mastery over causality, combined with choice, gives us free will -- even if our choices lead us to unexpected consequences. The advent of animate beings augmented causality with options. This is not unnatural or supernatural . . . it's just a different mode of response to causality: an evolution of causality, if you will. Intelligence includes the ability to learn from, adapt to, and harness causality for our own purposes. The mental process for this ability is not yet understood but appears to include a feedback mechanism. Humans understand causality and use it in self-directed ways. When causality meets intelligence, determinism becomes self-determinism. That's what free will is."	PRO	740

S6e758192-A7ea64dee	Heaven-Not Real	"Con""s argument will be in three parts: I. Dying Declarations; II. (A) Dying Declarations continued along with (B) World Religions which believe in Heaven; and III. Doctors/Patients Disclaimer I: If you question the veracity of the Scriptures, for whatever reasons, start with these two objective, scholarly, and honest attempts to explore the truth of the Scriptures: Josh McDowell (an apologist), Evidence that Demands a Verdict and Pamela Binnings Ewen (a lawyer), Faith on Trial. Disclaimer II: There is a saying in evidence law: a brick is not a wall. It means, one brick (a piece of evidence) does not build the whole wall (or prove the case). But several pieces do. While some of these ""bricks"" may seem unconnected, read to the finish, weigh them all, and consider it whole. From these several bricks the case for heaven is built. The Pro asked to prove the existence of ""the Christian [heaven]."" Observe: Part I. Dying Declarations In our courts of law, the rules of evidence allow dying declarations to be introduced as evidence. Federal Rules of Evidence ""804(b)(2). The rationale for why our courts allow this was explained in a 1975 case saying, ""[t]he reliability of a dying declaration is "" based on the premise that no one ""who is immediately going into the presence of his Maker will do so with a lie upon his lips."""" Commonwealth v. Douglas, 461 Pa. 749, 756 (Pa. 1975). The rules of evidence committee added further: ""While the original religious justification for the exception may have lost its conviction for some persons over the years, it can scarcely be doubted that [upon death] powerful psychological pressures are present."" Federal Rules of Evidence Committee Advisory Opinions to ""804(b)(2). Either way, dying declarations are allowed into courts because they tend to be truthful statements, either from fear of having just uttered a lie and then meeting one""s Maker or from the psychological pressures associated with dying. Regarding dying declarations, two elements must be proved before they are allowed into court as a reliable and true testimony: 1) the declarant (the speaker) believes he is in fact dying and 2) the declarant believes his death is imminent. Commonwealth v. Knable, 369 Pa. 171; Commonwealth v. Lockett, 291 Pa. 319; Commonwealth v. DeLeo, 242 Pa. 510. We will look at three dying declarations made during Christ""s crucifixion because these statements are honest beliefs about what the declarants thought regarding Christ and heaven. First, the railing malefactor""the one who mocked Jesus while they were on the cross""said, ""If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."" Luke 23.39. If I were to submit this dying declaration into a court of law, I would first have to satisfy both of the abovementioned elements. So, first, this man derisively mocked Jesus to save him, which means he understood his life needed saving, which we can conclude means he understood that he was about to die; secondly, this man""s comment, made while being crucified, meant he could either 1) be saved or 2) die. Since he did mocked Jesus, we can infer he believed he was imminently going to die. So, the two elements being met, this declaration can be introduced as a true utterance into a court. Now notice two things about this man""s dying declaration and what they reveal about heaven: 1) he said, ""If thou be Christ"""" From this we should infer that this criminal understood that there was a distinguished one named Christ; 2) then, he said, """"save thyself and us"""" which indicates that he truly believed that ""if"" this was in fact that distinguished Christ, Christ had an ability to save Himself (""save thyself"") and criminals (""and us.""). I submit this malefactor""s dying declaration to show two things: 1) this malefactor believed that there was, somewhere, a distinguished figure named Christ and 2) that this Christ had a power to save. Next, the second malefactor""s dying declaration begins with a rebuke of our first man: ""Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward [crucifixion] of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."" Luke 23.40-42. Again, for this to be accepted into court, the two elements of a dying declaration must be fulfilled. The first element""that the declarant believe he is in fact dying""is met and this we see when he said, ""Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou are in the same condemnation."" Luke 23.40. He understood that they were all condemned. Not condemned to just hang about but condemned to die. The second element can be met by an appeal to common knowledge, that Roman crucifixions were public because it mean those men hanging were criminals punished to die. Anyone on a cross could expect death soon. This man is no exception. Thus having met the two elements necessary for a dying declaration to be admitted into court, we can next examine this man""s statement to parse out what he believed to be true about heaven. First, this man understood Jesus to be innocent yet condemned; 2) he believed that they were about to meet God; 3) he believed Jesus possessed a kingdom (he said, ""thy kingdom""); 4) he believed he could appeal to Jesus to enter His kingdom after death (that""s why he said ""Lord remember me""). The last dying declaration to examine is from Jesus. He said, ""Verily [surely] I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise."" Luke 23.43. Again, let us first fulfill the two requirements so this dying declaration would be admitted into court. The first and second elements are satisfied simultaneously: ""Today shalt thou be with me in paradise."" Id. This means 1) Jesus believed He was to leave earth, go to paradise (put another way, He believed he was about to die) and 2) that this death was imminent, as a matter of fact, it would happen ""Today."" Id. The two elements being satisfied, this dying declaration can now be taken as a true statement and we can examine it for evidence as to what Jesus believed is true about heaven: 1) He believed there is another place after death (He called it paradise); 2) that men can go to this paradise; 3) that this place is His (we can infer this because Jesus did not deny the second malefactor""s statement when he referred to the next place as ""thy kingdom""; 4) that Jesus resides there (""... WITH ME in paradise.""). Luke 23.42,43. Now, let""s weave these three men""s dying declarations together for a summary of what they truly believed about heaven: 1. The first malefactor truly believed there existed a distinguished person named Christ that this Christ had an ability to save a man. 2. The second malefactor truly believed that upon death a man keeps living, that Jesus possessed a kingdom, that Jesus"" kingdom followed this life, and that he could plea to Jesus to remember him in this next life. 3. Jesus truly believed that after this life He would keep living, that after this life men could keep living, that He and men could live together in this place He called paradise, and that this kingdom was His. Part I Summary: This establishes some truths about what these three men believed about Christ and heaven. In Part II, we examine more dying declarations in order to see if these other versions match the above. Also, because a dying declarant has little motivation to lie, little incentive to lie, their words can be relied upon as having more truth than deceit. Thus: the importance of examining these. Also, we will look at the prevalence of heaven throughout world religions. In part III, the last round, I want to explore doctors and patients. Those two groups frequent death, so I expect them to reveal evidence which, when added to the whole debate, should prove heaven exists.

S3a7cba7f-A461b784d	Evolution is real.	"Exposing the Evolutionist’s Sleight-of-Hand With the Fossil Record Fred Williams January 2002 (Featured in Creation Digest, Winter 2002) Introduction One of the most effective pitches evolutionists use to sell their theory is their claim that the fossil record supports evolution. This could not be farther from the truth; in fact the fossil record provides powerful and overwhelming evidence that evolution did not occur on earth. So how is the evolutionist able to effectively sell to their audience the precise opposite of what the data shows? They achieve this by employing a clever sleight-of-hand with the fossil data that can easily be missed by any reasonable person. The purpose of this article is to expose this sleight-of-hand, which will then dissolve the false illusion it creates. Once the curtain is pulled and the illusion exposed, the truth can clearly be seen – the fossil record is an overwhelming and devastating contradiction to evolution. The Sleight-of-Hand Here’s the catch, the magic behind the illusion. Whenever an evolutionist presents his line of evidence for evolution in the fossil record, he will without fail, virtually every time, present a vertebrate transitional fossil. Why is this important? The evolutionist is failing to mention to his audience that vertebrates constitute less than .01% of the entire fossil record, and of these fossils, most species are represented by a bone or less!1 What about the other 99.99% of the fossil record? That’s the other key piece of information the evolutionist is withholding from you. Complex invertebrates make up the vast majority of this portion of the record, roughly 95%. We have cataloged literally millions of different species of these very complex creatures, and we have entire fossils, not just pieces here and there. In this rich and virtually complete portion of the fossil record, there is not a single sign of evolution, whatsoever!!!2 If evolution were true, the fossil record should be littered with countless examples showing many different transitions leading up to the millions of species of these complex creatures. YET WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE EXAMPLE! NOT EVEN ONE! The remarkable completeness of this vast portion of the fossil record thwarts evolutionists from cooking up ""transitionals"" because speculation is not so easy when you have entire specimens. There is not the wild guesswork inherent when dealing with willy-nilly fragments of a tooth here, a leg bone there. 1. The fossil distribution data comes from Answers is Genesis, and is based on various sources (including Paleontologist Dr. Kurt Wise). This data is not disputed by informed evolutionists, which includes frequent Talk.Origins regular Andrew Macrae. 2. For example, in the widely used college undergraduate textbook “Evolutionary Biology” (3rd Ed. 1998), author Douglas Futuyma does not list one single transitional leading up to the complex invertebrates (see chapter 6 in particular, “Evolving Lineages in the Fossil Record”). All his transitional examples spanning orders or classes are vertebrates! His only mention of the ""evolution"" of the complex invertebrates is a brief snippet on the changes in rib numbers on trilobites! This of course is nothing more than small-scale variation, or micro-evolution. Also see “Invertebrate Beginnings”, Paleobiology, 6: 365-70, R.D. Barnes, 1980. Also see Dr Chen’s comments in the Boston Globe article A Little Fish Challenges A Giant Of Science http://evolutionfairytale.com... An Analogy ""Image John the evolutionist and Fred the creationist entering a huge 50-story museum filled with all the fossils that have ever been unearthed. The curator of the museum explains that most of the complete fossils are displayed in every single room up to the 50th floor, while the incomplete fossils are kept in a small closet in the basement. The curator tells John and Fred that the fossils throughout the building represent all the invertebrate phyla discovered, literally billions of complete specimens representing millions of different species of complex invertebrate animal life, from clams, to trilobites, to sponges. The curator then tells John & Fred about the small closet in the basement. They are told that the fossils in this small room constitute only .0125% of the fossil record, and most of these are fish. He then adds that the remaining fossils in this small room that aren’t fish make up all the remaining vertebrate fossils, 95% of which are represented by less than a single bone. John and Fred scurry through all the evidence throughout the massive building, ignoring that little closet in the basement, realizing that it’s the most unrevealing data to look at. As the huge cache of complete fossils is examined, panic soon begins to set in for John the evolutionist because THERE IS NOT A TRACE OF EVOLUTION IN ANY OF THE EVIDENCE! NONE! THERE IS NOT A SINGLE LINK TO THE COMPLEX INVERTEBRATES, AND NOT A SINGLE LINK BETWEEN INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES! In a total state of panic and defeat, John suddenly remembers something the curator had mentioned. That little closet in the basement! John quickly runs to the basement and opens the door to the small closet. Soon his mind begins whirling, he becomes excited, and before long he has found “evidence” for evolution! These fragments of bones allow John to make all kinds of wild, fanciful speculation. “Hey, this is ‘evidence’, man!” John gleefully declares. The curator quickly reminds John that many similar past speculations made from observations from this tiny room have long since been refuted. He’s reminded of Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, Ramapithecus, Mesonychid, Pikaia, and so on and so forth. But John is so excited about his speculation that he chooses to ignore this very important and revealing truth. John goes on to gleefully tell others that “the fossil record supports evolution”, and gives them his “examples” from the closet in the basement. He fails to mention to them that his evidence is from a tiny closet full of incomplete specimens. He also fails to mention that all of the other rooms in the 50-story building contained complete specimens, yet yielded NO sign of evolution whatsoever. He tells his story over and over again, and before long, many begin to share in his fantasy, themselves telling the story to others over and over again.

Sae4073fd-A3f89306c	Some cryptids are real	"It is very tempting to believe that mythical creatures exist. In childhood, children would watch movies like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Princess and the Goblin,"" and others that would open a child's mind that there is more to the world. From Disney's fairy tales, to the original Grimm's Fairy Tales, it pushes the reader to believe that the world is a large and scary place. In olden time, strong religious believers viewed that the forests, or sea creatures are the works of evil. During that time, there might have been many creatures that humans did not understand and even feared. Today, scientists, biologists, explorers now know that creatures, known or unknown, have a beautiful purpose in this world. Creatures under the Cryptic category include Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster, mermaids, dragons, unicorns, a hybrid of two different species, the kraken, the list goes on and on. There is a branch of Zoologists called Cryptology, ""study of hidden animals,"" which refers to search for animals whose existence has neither been able to be proved or disproved. There are thousands upon thousands of eyewitness accounts of seeing all types of unexplainable creatures. There are still a lot of places on Earth that have been rarely or never been discovered, explored, or understood. My first argument is that even if we have not discovered hidden places, human technology and satellites have a better chance picking up anything that moves. If a massive sea serpent had conspicuously emerged, it is safe to say that satellites all over the world would be able to pick it up. Harriet Ritvo author of, The Platypus and the Mermaid, said that ""since sea serpents were never either captured or counterfeited, there pretensions could not be exposed to the standards of the laboratory."" So there is no concrete evidence or proof that monstrous creatures, like the sea serpents, exists. My second argument is that there is no doubt that there are still new species of animals to discover. The problem is that what people see, like Loch Ness or giant octopus, may be a new species that they do not understand. Humans fear what they do not know, so they come up with freighting creatures to match the profile of the unknown. I was watching a discovery program about ancient archeology. It portrayed that ancient Greeks and ancient Romans loved to dig, and like archaeologists today, they uncovered bones of extinct species. These species include dinosaurs, mammoths, and other prehistoric animals. Since they did not know this, they produced myths and legends to explain the bones, like Cyclops, and other mystical creatures that dominate Greek mythology. Today is no different, we explain the unknown by calling them monsters. It is a fact that ""late-eighteenth-century naturalists tentatively described the newly discovered platypus as an amalgam of bird, reptile, and mammal,"" (Ritvo, p 132). New creatures are intimidating but we might be mistaking them for monsters. I do not doubt that there are new creatures that scientists and explorers have not yet discovered, but it does not mean they are the iconic, boat and people-eating, fire-breathing monsters myth had portrayed them to be over the years."

As for the article provided here: http://www.wnd.com... The article even states that the whereabouts of this ""chariot wheel"" are currently unknown, and the fact the diver didn't take it with him raises suspicions, almost like they knew examining the item further than a photo would reveal it as something else. From the photo provided in the article, it cannot positively be identified to any degree to being a chariot wheel. https://scienceandbelief.org... This article here is nothing but a scientist who is religious, believing in something that completely goes against his occupation, it proves nothing regarding my arguments with turning water into wine and the Red Sea parting. It defies all scientific explanation, he states, because it did not happen, which is what I assert and such has yet to be proven to have actually happened. http://askjohnmackay.com... This article suggests that Jesus Christ turned water into wine by creating carbon from nothing, which is just as ludicrous as what he was trying to explain reasonably. Unfortunately, none of the opposition's three articles have proven anything beyond more tales of how these events happened, and even then none of the authors or anyone quoted is sure of how it happened, meaning it is all just baseless conjecture. I will concede to the fact that the Bible has been written by many people over the course of approximately 2000 years, however, this also leads to the point that humans have always had a knack for making up events or twisting the truth to make it sound better, this has not been a trait of the past 100 or so years. As for the opposition challenging me to prove that such a being does not exist, as I stated in my previous response, the Burden of Proof lies with the person making the claim. The opposition is suggesting that there is a being that defies what laws and scientific explanation we all know, then they must prove it otherwise the scientific explanations that have more basis for being true will remain firmly in place as the truth. Which is always the issue when it comes to religious debates, the events of religion have always existed before official records were kept, making it exceedingly difficult to prove that anything of such ever happened. We have had many tragedies in this day and age more severe than what has been depicted in the Bible, yet no miracle has happened to stop such tragedies, the religious will say that God has forsaken us for something we have done, the non-believers will say no such miracles ever happened. I would believe the opposition's story of a girl regrowing muscle in a matter of seconds or minutes if there was some kind of photo or video evidence, however it seems when ever a miracle such as this happens, there is no such evidence available."

Sae461508-A89c535b9	God is real	"Indeed, it is as you say, I can say that your claims are false, and that is what I shall assert as there is nothing more than mere tales and paintings that depict such ""miracles."" It is medically and scientifically impossible for someone who has been unable to walk for some time to simply begin walking again with no prior physiotherapy, this calls into the question whether this girl even had the condition you thought she had. On another note, the Bible claims that God parted the Red Sea to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians, yet not only is it impossible for the sea to be parted in such a way, as determined by scientific laws, but parts of the Red Sea are several hundred metres deep which would mean anyone crossing would fatally fall hundreds of metres down. Another example of what can be deemed impossible, where the Bible claims that Jesus Christ changed water into wine, using nothing but his will. It is impossible to change the atomic structure of anything to something completely different using your will, touch or otherwise. It has been proven that the Red Sea is several hundred, even thousands of metres deep, anyone can go confirm that with the right equipment and transport. It has also been proven that atoms exist and that they cannot be changed as the Bible claims they can. What has not been proven is that someone has or can be cured through prayer alone or that an all-powerful, all-knowing being exists that has supposedly granted these miracles. The Burden of Proof lies with the one making the claim, and the opposition claims that a higher power exists, I challenge them to show definitive proof in their response."	CON	758
S1a699cf1-Ac05f0b1f	ADHD is not real	You say that genes are not set, so if a black male grew up in a white female sorority then they could become a white female because his their genes are not set? Some genes are changeable and others are not. And a second child's genes would be different because there are endless possible combinations that can be made of different genes from different parents. myadhd.com Says that children who have parents with ADHD are more prone towards having it. This seems like a direct indicator towards a genetic hereditary disorder. People have shown symptoms of ADHD for ages, only the environment was different and there was no diagnosis. Now that we have seen negative effects of it in daily life we want to diagnose it and treat it. Often we will see ADHD in one sibling but not the other, and yet they have very similar environments. This is because one has a genetic predetermination that the other does not. Denying that these people have a genetic predetermination implies that there is something wrong with them that they could have prevented. ADHD cannot be prevented or changed, people are born with it they do not acquire it over time, it is something that was not preventable. As soon as a baby is conceived and their genetic makeup is created they either have ADHD or they do not have it. It is not created by environment, it is an unavoidable genetic predetermination.	CON	759
S1a699cf1-A6b6fd56b	ADHD is not real	"That is true, many different factors influence personality. Everyone's personality is a little bit different, there is never one that is quite the same. Then why are certain people all over the world exhibiting a specific set of symptoms or ""behaviors"". And what about other disorders? Are they also just behaviors? What about Autism and Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder? Are those also just behaviors all caused by environment? Personality is influenced by environment, but it is all based off of genes. Some babies are more calm than others, some play better with other babies. These are just the genes that they were born with We are born with some personality traits that cannot be changed. Over time people adapt their personalities to fit their environment. Different schools teach different values, come children are taught to be sharing and giving, while others are taught to fight for everything. But over time these behaviors change as the person's environment changes. ADHD is always there, it may taper off a little as people get older but it stays with them their entire lives it does not change based on the environment. Even in schools for children with ADHD the children do not become calmer or more able to focus. In my experience they are still medicated and they still have the hyperactivity, the schools just try to unleash all of that pent up energy. They cannot change the person no matter what they do. This school was K-8 and even after nine years children still had severe ADHD. You say ""perhaps over many years this would decrease"", but after nine years they still have ADHD. If their ""personality"" cannot be changed after nine years than I think that that is a clear indicator that this is something that cannot be influenced by environment. You imply that by believing that people are born with certain unchangeable personality traits we are promoting discrimination and eugenics. By not letting people believe this we are promoting eugenics. For hundreds of years unrecognized minorities have been bullied and discriminated against because they were not publicly recognized for being different. They were outcasts and alone, they were the same group but they were not united. By not admitting that children with ADHD have a known disorder we are letting them go back to being the badly behaved kid in the classroom. By diagnosing them and telling them that they are not alone we are preventing discrimination. It is the attitude of denial that creates discrimination, not recognition of the difference."	CON	760
S1a699cf1-A68b4a6a1	ADHD is not real	"Just a point before we begin, you say: ""By not admitting that children with ADHD have a known disorder we are letting them go back to being the badly behaved kid in the classroom. By diagnosing them and telling them that they are not alone we are preventing discrimination. It is the attitude of denial that creates discrimination, not recognition of the difference."" If your way is right, why do you also say that: ""This school was K-8 and even after nine years children still had severe ADHD"" and: ""Even in schools for children with ADHD the children do not become calmer or more able to focus. In my experience they are still medicated and they still have the hyperactivity."" So it seems this method of labelling them and segregating them, medicating them and treating it like a genetic predetermination, doesn't work very well. Would you agree its not working? it doesn't sound like it too me. So anyway, your argument: You say: ""Then why are certain people all over the world exhibiting a specific set of symptoms or ""behaviors."" Well, they are not, this is what I have been saying all along. 'Difficulty focusing on schoolwork' 'high energy levels' 'Fidgeting' (in school I remind you) are hardy 'specific' traits are they? I would even go so far as to say they are common, or even predictable in the circumstances. You say: ""And what about other disorders? Are they also just behaviors? What about Autism and Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."" Well I say pretty much the same thing, schizophrenics and bipolar sufferers are far more likely to have has traumatic experiences in childhood or even extreme circumstances. Genes do not determine behaviour, the predispose only, this is not predetermination. I do not know enough about autism to comment, though I am aware of people who have been 'falsely' labelled with it and I am not wholly convinced by its determination. Skitzophennia however I have some experience with and from this I believe that it is environmental. Also courses like (Human behavioural biology, Robert Sapolsky) explain in detail how schizophrenia, bipolar and even perhaps autism are largely environmentally determined. But this debate is about ADHD and this is most certainly not predetermined, at best it is predisposed but I don't believe its this simple at all. You say ""Personality is influenced by environment, but it is all based off of genes."" Well not exactly. For example, a particular gene that is more common in the most violent people. However, the carriers of this gene had to of been abused as children, if they had this gene but where not abused, they where actually less violent than average. Violent people without this gene where not always as violent as the ones with it though. So its not like ""genes set the basis"" and ""experiences goes from there"" its far more subtle, beautifully complex and counter-intuitive. You say: ""Some babies are more calm than others, some play better with other babies. These are just the genes that they were born with,"" I have explained this, we are 9 months old when we are born! We have evolved to 'evolve', in the safety of the womb, to the world we are about to enter. There is a lot of research showing the effects of the prenatal environment on the unborn baby, showing stress for example to make babies more prone to addiction, mood swings ect. So how much more subtle personality shaping is going on in there? You say: ""We are born with some personality traits that cannot be changed."" Not true. If you abuse a child he/she will change. So with that as a factual basis, we can assume everything effects your personality to some degree, even if only slightly. Also, to illustrate the power of the situation on the individual, I ask you to think about the numerous hypnotists that can make people think they are a chicken from merely effecting the environment. Our minds our powerful things, not in our control, we can convince ourselves of almost anything and self fulfil it until it feels natural. You say: ""after nine years they still have ADHD. If their ""personality"" cannot be changed after nine years than I think that that is a clear indicator that this is something that cannot be influenced by environment"" Well not if their environment hasn't changed in a way that would change this behaviour. The people who run these schools are still not fully aware of what it is (I am not saying I am). Also its factors in the outside world that cause ADHD as well as school, so I imagine that ADHD school isn't worlds apart from a normal school, and thus its no wonder the 'condition' continues. You say: ""By not admitting that children with ADHD have a known disorder we are letting them go back to being the badly behaved kid in the classroom"" I am not saying put them back into the classroom, I am saying the classroom 'caused' it! I am saying we need to rethink our idea of education, we need to understand children and human beings in general more and fit society to their needs. It is not engaging children properly that has spawned this epidemic, along with bad diets, poor role models and a frankly confusing society. Also I would like to add to my first point: If the current method of dealing with it is working, why is ADHD become more common, and why does that correlate with the increase of medication. Surely the more medication, the less ADHD, and surly if us being aware and labelling it is helping, it should be on the decrease. No, it will never change until the underlying societal factors are fixed. And this is testament to the fact that it is avoidable and not a life sentence inscribed at birth. Also, the reason why labelling people is more like eugenics than not labelling is because it gives no way out. It says to anyone not conforming that you are a problem person who should be delt with through medication of punishment. If we understand these people, we will find that they in fact have as much to offer as the rest of us. Recognizing the difference, too you means, labelling a person as a disease. I recognize the difference and I attempt to avoid it and combat it, because I would of said to a sufferer of ADHD that he is not permanently bad because he was born that way, I would say he is misunderstood and I would ask them what it was they wanted to do."

S1a699cf1-A32759c0a	ADHD is not real	You say that these are not specific traits, then what defines specific. Also one of these traits might not be specific on its own but the more and more traits you add, the rarer the combination is. You show the example of one gene that is changed by environment, but fail to mention hundreds of others that are for the most part not. being in the womb does affect personality, but only a tiny bit. The ADHD school that I speak of was one of the most alternative schools that I have ever seen. Every morning they would provide intense exercise of the children for an hour. Then the children were provided with specially trained private tutors, every hour they would have a break. And every Friday they would spend all day outside. That sounds pretty far from normal to me. You say that the classroom caused it. Then why don't all children have it? Do some have some genetic predetermination that could be causing this? ADHD might be becoming more common is genetics, if parents pass down ADHD to their children then it should be increasing exponentially.	CON	762
S1a699cf1-A8001fb0a	ADHD is not real	One cannot acquire hyperactivity or the inability to focus. A particularly distracting environment might make a child less attentive, but then all children would be less attentive. ADHD is an anomaly, it is not caused by environment, it is an unnatural amount of energy and the inability to focus. Someone's environment cannot make them hyperactive to that level. you say that if they were in a different environment then they would not be like this. I have personal experience with a school for Dyslexic and ADHD children and they still act exactly the same as they do in a regular school environment. They have the same symptoms. It is not the environment that creates hyperactivity and attention deficit, it is the person.	CON	763
S1a699cf1-A9bfbbb13	ADHD is not real	"Your point. ""One cannot acquire hyperactivity or the inability to focus. A particularly distracting environment might make a child less attentive, but then all children would be less attentive. ADHD is an anomaly, it is not caused by environment"" I am sorry but this statement is completely false. For one, all children would not be less attentive because they all have had different upbringings. To say one does not acquire the trait of being unable to focus on a particular task is ridiculous, our personalities are even being shaped in the womb. There is ample research showing this. Our body and everything in it is effected by its environment as soon as it has an environment. If the mother is stressed in pregnancy the child will be more prone to addiction, anger problems and disruptive behaviour. So if even at this stage or personality is being formed, why is it so strange for us to acquire hyperactivity or the inability to focus. (and I must add that ADHD does not give you an inability to focus, it makes you more likely to get bored of things that don't interest you. Indeed you may focus more than 'normal' people on things you enjoy). So I am assuming you have limited knowledge of genes and the biology of behaviour? Anyone who knows about this in detail will tell you that genes are not determinants of behaviour or life, they are flexible (environment) to the point of completely self-destructing or changing completely. They are like an instruction book, that doesn't always need to be read in full, nor followed to the letter if the circumstances call for it. Indeed it is more complex than a book, for it has the capacity to change ITSELF in response to the environment and not just change transcription. The most flexible genetics are the ones coding for behaviours,, behaviour is basically hormone (on a biological level) and we know that hormones change in response to environment. For example there are thousands of types of receptors that pick up the same hormone, there can also be a lot, or not many of these, also the nerve cells 'characteristics' can be effected by other hormones, and the proteins that release these hormones can be made in different ways, the genes that code for all these variations respond to environment. It is impossible to talk about biology without environment. For example if you put a new born baby in a room on its own (for one you would have to feed it and that would diversify its environment, not to mention prenatal effects) it would die before long. So it is impossible to study the human outside the context of environment. For you to be thinking that we are born with genetically determined personalities that are set and are almost unchangeable is shocking to me, I thought we had all moved on from this. This kind of mentality is not so far from eugenics and other social models that lead to discrimination. You say. "" It is not the environment that creates hyperactivity and attention deficit, it is the person."" What does this mean? I it what I said before about the genetically determined behaviour? Another example of the circumstances of the environment changing personality follows: Children who are abused actually have a gene completely changed, that is not present before the abuse. You say. "" I have personal experience with a school for Dyslexic and ADHD children and they still act exactly the same as they do in a regular school environment"" Yes because they are already like that, perhaps over many years this would decrease, but I don't understand how this shows ADHD to be a product of genetics and and not society."	PRO	764
S1a699cf1-Aff9aa9a6	ADHD is not real	ADHD does not occur by itself. It is not an actual thing so to speak. There are such a thing as people, with the personality traits, that fit the description of the symptoms of ADHD-but ADHD itself does not exist like for example cancer or down syndrome does. Its symptoms are merely a description of behaviours that are natural, and that a lot of people exhibit in this society. They then find a drug that alters the physiology of the hormones that are typically associated with the type of behaviour exhibited. This does not mean that it exists! By exist in itself I mean it cannot spring on you by itself and effect you, nor can you be born with it. It is merely a reaction to the society and the specific experiences of the person effected. So the term should be forgotten, and the causes of this behaviour should be dealt with. Also it makes sense that drug companies would support this form of lifelong medication, for money. Also its good for government because it takes the focus away from the underlying societal problems and doesn't undermine the system. For it cant be the system, it must be the individual. So there are major political and financial advantages of ADHD and these are the people pushing it. Also its easier for everyone to think that the problems are not their fault, but just unlucky genes or whatever logic they use.	PRO	765
Sb22075a5-A16678221	God is Real	"Well, since we are not here to debate whether or not Einstein believes in a God you don't believe exist, I think its a moot point to continue down that path. I have given you enough evidence on his position. Logically thinking, you cannot argue against something without first considering that its possible, for the record. If there were absolute irrefutable ""evidence"" of no God, no one would have accepted the challenge. I didn't say you claimed no scientist believed in God, I merely pointed out that you didn't claim any did. You did however imply that ""100's of scientists"" did not. I mere illustrated that 100's of others do. It doesn't matter how many scientist believe or not believe or who is in the ""minority"" When they are wrong, that are almost universally wrong, aren't they? It doesn't really give credence to free thinking among scientists, does it? Conceding that most scientist don't believe in God means what? I can also conclude that most idiots don't believe in God either. What's the point either way? Science has all the answers? That's your god? Then why can't it answer the questions I posed??? Why has science been so wrong about so many things? God of the Gaps You readily admit that there are mysteries in nature that science has not yet found the answers to in all these billions of billions of years. Someone or something is very limited if the earth has been here THAT long and STILL not one scientist can come up with the answer to these unanswered questions....unless you consult your Bible. The answers are ALL there. I appreciate your assertion about many people being overconfident about the inability to explain something. That works in reverse as well. While you may feel its ok to say, ""we do not yet know something but perhaps someday we will"", I can equally assert that ""the fool has said in his heart there is no God"", or ""For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse"", the Holy Bible. You talk about certainty, but what are you certain about? Nothing exploding out of nothing and creating something out of nothing? That most scientific theories are the guess work of (some) madmen who refuse to believe in God, many theories of which are often proven wrong? The problem is, a rebellious person never wants to be accountable to a divine righteous God because it requires ""accountability"" and we live in a time where that word is almost an insult more so than EVER before. Again, You breathe invisible air, are held here by an invisible force...blah blah blah, but refuse to even consider an invisible force, responsible for all creation and its sustenance? What sense does this make? Debunking the Law of Bio-genesis Argument You can continue to attempt to debunk this, but the Bible says ""And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul"". God gave man life. The law of bio-genesis is completely applicable. Its too late to try to debunk it and disassociate it with a Creator God. Life doesn't spring out of nowhere. That's YOUR god, SCIENCE, talking pal. One of the several scientific experiments that you clearly ignored or apparently conceded to was the one by Malcolm Browne who discovered in his theory, ""Signal Travels Faster Than Light"" that there was a force connecting two freed electrons, it proved to be eternal (energy cannot be created or destroyed, remember?) was present in our time yet not involved with the flow of our time. He theorized that this ""force"" connects ALL freed electrons. Every particle that releases energy connects to this force. Everything that is connected beyond the stars all release electrons, light, radiation, etc. This means this force is everywhere in the universe and would see an know everything in the universe. This is simple enough. You say that energy is the creator god while I say God is a tremendous light and power source that created the universe and gave it life. Why does this NOT make sense to you???

He maintains that all freed electrons behave as if they are being influenced by an outside variable or force. This is the basis of his ""Uncertainty Principle"". I would like to ask you, what is that ""force""? Malcolm W. Browne discovered that there was a force that connected to two freed electrons and since energy is eternal, this force had to be and that it was also present in our time yet not involved with the flow of our time. Again I ask you, ""what is that force""? YOU say that science does not prove God. I say it DOES. Many great scientists, the smartest ones, like Sir Isaac Newton, Carl Sagan and the greatest scientist of our times, Albert Einstein did/does believe in God. Here is a list for you of a number of scientists that does believe in God; Nicholas Copernicus Sir Francis Bacon Johannes Kepler Galileo Galilei Rene Descartes Blaise Pascal Robert Boyle Michael Faraday Gregor Mendel William Thomson Kelvin Max Planck I could go on and on and on, so I don't know who this ""majority of scientist"" you talk about that don't believe in God are. I am one who does. I have provided for you two experiments completed by scientists that prove there is an eternal force manipulating and connecting energy. Your ""religion"", science, says energy can be neither created nor destroyed, if you don't know of this theory, then that says a lot right there. No offense to you, but you probably want to do a bit more research. Energy has been proven to be eternal, connected to all freed electrons which means it is everywhere, knows everything and is timeless. If God controls and connects all freed electrons and have all of these attributes, then he would in fact be GOD, wouldn't he? Science itself has proven these things about energy. I challenge YOU to do your own homework on this. I have given you the framework. You can look up Heisenberg and Browne, and while you're at it, look up Quantum Balancing, and the Russian Science Experiment, The Double Slit Experiment and Volgelsang's Self Thinking Interface or STI device, and you will find your scientific proof there. You claim ""not to get"" the ""scientific theory"" on energy and its attributes, lol? Please feel free to look that one up also, for your own edification. Is is no small wonder that it ""seems"" irrational"" to you, yet you fail to describe how and why. Please enlighten us. The Law of bio-genesis means ""all life comes from LIFE"", not out of nothing. If this scientific theory is to hold true, life could not be created out of nothingness. It would HAVE to be borne out of......LIFE. Meaning you have a ""Creator"", my friend. It takes a much greater leap of faith for me to believe nothing blew up, and out of nothing came a perfectly crafted universe capable of creating and sustaining ""life"" out of nothing. THAT seems ""irrational"" to me. The Law of Thermodynamics discusses ""entropy"", meaning anything, left to itself, would decay or fall into a state of chaos. Everything. Even an empty room, unattended, would fall into decay. This theory proves that this universe of ours has to have a ""caretaker"" otherwise, the ""Scientific Law"" of thermodynamics is moot. It seems to be easier to disprove scientific ""laws"" than it is to disprove God, unless those ""laws"" proclaim a Creator God, which they do. As for like forces repelling, again, this clearly illustrates your ignorance of both science and God. Man is made of of atoms. Atoms are made up of neutrons and protons. Like forces, according to science, are supposed to repel. What, my friend, may I ask is holding us together??? Let me know when you come up with the answer.

When eminance was controlled for, disbelief in God only increased. You gave me a list of 11 scientists, most of whom died hundreds of years ago.

[1] ""With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions - fear of hunger, wild beasts, sickness, death.

I’m no smarter after hearing 'God did it' than before."" [3] Re: The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics ""Another prediction of the creator hypothesis also fails to be confirmed by the data. If the universe were created, then it should have possessed some degree of order at the creation—the design that was inserted at that point by the Grand Designer. This expectation of order is usually expressed in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy or disorder of a closed system must remain constant or increase with time. It would seem to follow that if the universe today is a closed system, it could not always have been so. At some point in the past, order must have been imparted from the outside. Prior to 1929, this was a strong argument for a miraculous creation. However, in that year astronomer Edwin Hubble reported that the galaxies are moving away from one another at speeds approximately proportional to their distance, indicating that the universe is expanding. This provided the earliest evidence for the big bang. For our purposes, an expanding universe could have started in total chaos and still formed localized order consistent with the second law. The simplest way to see this is with a (literally) homey example. Suppose that whenever you clean your house, you empty the collected rubbish by tossing it out the window into your yard. Eventually the yard would be filled with rubbish. However, you can continue doing this with a simple expedient. Just keep buying up the land around your house and you will always have more room to toss the rubbish. You are able to maintain localized order—in your house—at the expense of increased disorder in the rest of the universe. Similarly, parts of the universe can become more orderly as the rubbish, or entropy, produced during the ordering process (think of it as disorder being removed from the system being ordered) is tossed out into the larger, ever-expanding surrounding space. As illustrated in figure 4.1, the total entropy of the universe increases as the universe expands, as required by the second law. However, the maximum possible entropy increases even faster, leaving increasingly more room for order to form. The reason for this is that the maximum entropy of a sphere of a certain radius (we are thinking of the universe as a sphere) is that of a black hole of that radius. The expanding universe is not a black hole and so has less than maximum entropy. Thus, while becoming more disorderly on the whole as time goes by, our expanding universe is not maximally disordered.

According to Prince Hubertus, Einstein said, ""In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views."" Sounds like a believer to me, and he was quite critical, to the point of anger, about people like you. ""Science has unanswered questions"" is simply another repackaging of ""I don't know"". It goes both ways. It also tells us nothing new. I'm no smarter after hearing ""Science has unanswered questions"" than before. Scientists clearly state all the time that if there is a cause and effect to anything, science ought to be able to explain it. Why can't science answer those questions I posed? Belief in a Creator God can. He would be the only possible answer when ""science has unanswered questions"". Re: The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics Your cut and paste response of the writing on the 2nd law of thermodynamics is baseless. You talk about dumping rubbish into a yard and expanding it to the point everything because some how orderly through this expansion (lol). Yea, and if I throw a couple of paints on the wall, eventually, it would form into the Mona Lisa too, over billions and billions of years, right? How can you present this argument (proving that you don't really know science or its laws, its no wonder you can't conceive a Creator God) if you don't realize that science at first believed that the universe was infinite? It was only later that ""science"" realized that the universe was expanding (oops), so what is it ""expanding"" into? Its own infinite-ness? Do you see the folly of your logic and those who support it? Science is wrong, more often than not. And please don't criticize my support of the fathers of science and talk about how long they've been dead and then also quote scientists from the stone age. That's a tad hypocritical and kind of rank amateurish of you as a debater. You didn't respond to a myriad of other questions I presented, experiments that were tested and proven about energy, its qualities (the same qualities that the Bible insist God has) how it relates to this universe, about freed electrons and how energy is timeless, everywhere, all knowing and all powerful. Powerful enough to create matter out of a transformation of other energy....Go on my friend, dig deeper. You will find the answers to the questions that ""science can't answer"" because in reality, science already has. There is a Creator God and science, more so and than any other religion, proclaims it and loudly.

Sb22075a5-Ae2ebc8cc	God is Real	"On Einstein / Scientists' Belief in God Whether or not Einstein was an ""atheist"" depends on your definition of God, and your definition of atheism. Einstein said, ""I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of all that exists, but not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and doings of mankind."" He also said, ""From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist."" [1] Obviously, Einstein did not believe in the God of Christianity. I never made the claim that ""no scientists believe in God."" Many scientists believe in God, especially scientists who lived hundreds of years ago. Scientists subscribed to all sorts of unscientific nonsense back then. Isaac Newton believed in God; he also believed in alchemy. Today, in 2016, nobody considers alchemy to be a legitimate scientific pursuit. I am certain you could come up with a sizable list of scientists, past and present, who believe in God. This would not change the fact that these scientists are in the minority. Unless you can show me the results of a comparable study that contradicts the results of the study I provided, you must concede that most scientists do not believe in God. God of the Gaps I readily admit that there are mysteries in nature that science has not yet found the answer to. ""Many people are overconfident enough to think that if they cannot explain something, it must be inexplicable and therefore a true mystery of the paranormal...There are many genuine unsolved mysteries in the universe and it is okay to say, 'We do not yet know but someday perhaps we will.' The problem is that most of us find it more comforting to have certainty, even if it is premature, than to live with unsolved or unexplained mysteries."" [2] ""Science does not explain everything, so there is always room for other explanations and the believer is easily convinced that the explanation is God. However, the God of the gaps argument by itself fails, at least as a scientific argument, unless the phenomenon in question is not only currently scientifically inexplicable but can be shown to forever defy natural description. God can only show up by proving to be necessary, with science equally proven to be incapable of providing a plausible account of the phenomenon based on natural or material processes alone."" [3] ""God did it"" is not a scientific theory. It's a pseudo-explanation. It applies everywhere, and explains nothing. Once upon a time, people had no scientific explanation for night and day. People like you would have said, ""Oh you can't explain it? Well I can: God did it!"" Luckily, there were people who would not accept ""God did it"" as a sufficient explanation. Those people went on to discover the genuine explanation for night and day: the earth is round, and it rotates. You said: ""...please don't criticize my support of the fathers of science and talk about how long they've been dead and then also quote scientists from the stone age."" I quoted a book from 2007. I don't know what you're talking about here. Debunking the Law of Biogenesis Argument Biogenesis is ""the theory, opposed to spontaneous generation, that living matter always arises by the agency of preexisting living matter."" [4] Here's another definition: the law of biogenesis is ""the observation that living things only come from other living things, by reproduction (e.g. a spider lays eggs, which develop into spiders). That is, life does not arise from non-living material, which was the position held by spontaneous generation."" [5] God is supernatural. God is not ""living matter"" or a ""living thing"" made out of ""living material"" who birthed humanity through physical reproduction. The law of biogenesis does not apply. On Energy You said, ""Energy has been proven to be eternal, connected to all freed electrons which means it is everywhere, knows everything and is timeless. If God controls and connects all freed electrons and have all of these attributes, then he would in fact be GOD, wouldn't he? Science itself has proven these things about energy."" Sounds like you're anthropomorphizing energy. In what sense does energy ""know"" anything? Furthermore, you're making some irrational leaps here. Energy is eternal, therefore energy is the personal creator God of the Bible? That doesn't make any sense. SOURCES [1] Quotes from Einstein found in The Believing Brain, by Michael Shermer.

S209e6901-A96995078	Real social change requires real action.	Today’s society boasts of if equality towards both genders, though the lyrics and contexts of modern music state otherwise. By merely watching and hearing lyrics of the most popular songs from adolescent culture, it is inevitable to notice the sheer absence of respect for women, even through Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie” which features Rihanna. The lyrics, “If she ever tries to f***ing leave again, I’mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire” directly shows the violence and the music video not only collaborates this violence but also portrays females’ as sex objects. Rihanna’s own experience with violence through her boyfriend, Chris Brown, and her part in the song “but that’s OK, because I like the way it hurts” subliminally sends a message to many teens that even females find violent behaviour and abuse OK. A study done during 2003 in Washington, proved that violent lyrics directly affected, and caused violent thoughts. It is then unsurprising that statistics in the US of VAW show that every 18 minutes a female is beaten, and a female is raped every 6 minutes [[http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm]]. It is also shown that in France, 95% of victims of violence are females, 51% of these crimes are committed by their husbands [[http://www.ideaconnection.com/solutions/7216-Violence-against-women.html]] – the link between violence and song lyrics that heavily glorifies violence is clear. It is preposterous for society to merely put on a facade that there is equality between the sexes, and yet, when statistics and studies prove and explain evidence contradict this do nothing about it. UN conventions, such as the UN Convention on Discrimination against Women have been put into place for the sole purpose of protecting women from inhumanity and yet the incidences are not declining significantly enough. Proving that these restrictions are not working and shows why further restrictions on music content are necessary.	PRO	771
S209e6901-A3bb53b19	Real social change requires real action.	Majority of society already believes in womens rights. There is a minority who do not. In order for the prop argument to stand they need to show us why 1) Normal people are likely to consume this media and if they do, how & why their views on women are likely to change. 2) Why the bigots would change their minds simply because they cannot access this music. The ban will not change this because they listen to this music because they are bigots, not that they are bigots because they listen to the music. So the problem starts with the misogynistic attitudes of the person to begin with. This is more rational to believe based on simple economics. People are in the music business to make money. It is very expensive to produce and market records. So it makes sense to make records for a market that already exists rather than hoping to change society to like the music you produce. Simply put, suppliers supply what is demanded rather than consumers demanding anything that is supplied. So the problem the govt should be solving is changing societal attitudes. The west has already succeeded in doing this because we recognize that you cannot change the opinion of every signle individual and that some bigots will always exist. We can look at examples like EU countries that ban holocaust denial or glorifying Nazism. Despite these bans we still see the existence of Neo-Nazi & Facist groups. In fact they are more prevalent in countries that ban holocaust denial than in the US which allows it. You can never have a total eradication of bigotry.	CON	772
Sa4352af2-A1f9ed4a	The God of Classic theism is real	My opponent has abandoned all of his arguments and has resorted to preaching. Moreover, he has failed to give a sufficient rebuttal to my argument. However, my opponent did present a version of Pascal's wager in his last round. This argument is irrelevant to the existence of God, but I will respond to it anyway. =====> The Empty Wager Of Blaise Pascal <===== Blaise Pascal was a rather brilliant scientist that lived in the sixteenth century. During the later part of his life he ended up defending the Christian faith, and he addressed his Pensï¿½es to those people that couldn't manage to accrue religious faith. As it turns out, this happens to be me, along with quite a few other people. Pascal's wager basically states that faith is a safer bet to make than unbelief, since nothing of value is lost if one chooses to have faith. Needless to say, this line of reasoning is flawed for a number of reasons. For example, there are an infinite number of potential Gods and religions one could place faith in. Therefore, people will almost certainly be mistaken about their beliefs in God, given the diversity of beliefs on offer. Consequently, any faith placed in God or religion is likely to be in error, since all of these religious assumptions are unfounded. Moreover, those that cling to this belief in a God will have ended up misusing the only life they do have by living under an illusion. I will simply end this debate by allowing the viewers to see how Christopher Hitchens deals with Pascal's Wager. [1] ::References:: 1. Youtube video http://www.youtube.com...

Sa4352af2-A99ccbc13	The God of Classic theism is real	"Thank you for accepting this debate. here's your ""run for your money to this debate"":) My opponent as one barley formed contention against me. I will prove how wrong he is by formulating an argument that is ""logically valid"" and ""simultaneously dismantle"" his arguments. My C1: My opponents main argument revolves around circular logic. He ever so graciously provides a snobby picture to illustrate it. Here's MY circular logic explanation: ""But why don't you believe the Bible?"" BECAUSE THE BIBLE IS BOGUS ""But how do you know the bible is bogus?"" BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION ""But how can you be sure of evolution?"" BECAUSE DARWIN ACCEPTS EVOLUTION AND DENIES THE BIBLE As you can see, my opponent Is also using circular logic. Here is nother way he is ALSO using it... He said ""Even if evolution weren't true, that would not prove that God exists. However, evolution is most certainly true..."" OK, even if evolution WAS true, THAT wouldn't prove that God DOESN'T exist. So his whole attack on my C1 falls because it fails to attack the existence of God, because the only ""attack"" he has to ""deny"" God's existence, is Evolution. He said ""Even if evolution weren't...most certainly true."", however, the converse is also true. My C2:""This isn't even an argument."" This is debate slang for "" don't have any arguments."" Actually, it IS an argument:) +++++>>>My opponents Case<<<+++++ HIS C1: OK, first off I love your tag line:The Argument From Divine Hiddenness. He goes on to say ""The argument from divine hiddenness, also known as the argument from non-belief, seeks to demonstrate the nonexistent of God by pointing out an INCONSISTENCY within the theistic worldview"" Who are YOU to challenge God's consistency by your ""98% ape"" brain standards(HE said it, not me). Just read on in his case... "" ...then he should have brought about a situation whereby everyone reasonably believed in him. As such, if God existed and God wanted us to know this, then reasonable non-belief should not occur. But reasonable non-belief does occur because God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, if he does exist. This, it would seem, entails a contradiction."" How DARE you say what the all knowing God should do? Who do you think you are?! He has provided an abundance of evidence(i.e. prophets,the bible) which you refuse to recognize. The reason God created us is so we would worship Him through our own FREEWILL!!! And in this section of the debate and also in a few other instances where I will point out later, my opponent is not topical. ""But reasonable non-belief does occur because God has refused to provide any compelling evidence that he exists, IF HE DOES EXIST. "" The resolution says ""The God of Classic Theism is Real"" My opponent HAS NOT denied the existence of God with this. Moving on to attack Theodore Drange's syllogism. What backing do you have to this being fact? 1a)I agree b)His son died to save our sins. 1 Corinthians 15:2-4 (New International Version) (2)By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.(3)For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, (4)that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, c)agree, but the devil tempts us d)agree, but the devil tempts us 2) NO! we are to believe by our own FREEWILL. How would it be ""Believing"" if we were forced by Him to believe? Then we'd have no freewill 3)True. Absolutely. Here's why: John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2)He was with God in the beginning. (3)Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. (4)In him was life, and that life was the light of men. (5)The light shines in the darkness, BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD IT. .:Therefore God exists. Here's the interesting part.""The common religious response to this argument usually alludes to the notion that the ways of God are mysterious."" Nope, not MINE... My opponent is saying HIS unbelief in MY belief makes my belief untrue. THIS is circular reasoning...If I'm guilty, my opponent is also. Moving on ""According to theism, God wants humans to have a relationship with him. Meanwhile, this God has also cloaked himself from the greatest tools and insights of modern science"" Well first of all you have to believe in Him. If you don't, then you cant have a relationship with Him. But God really has ""also cloaked himself from the greatest tools and insights of modern science"". Really? OK fist off he's off topic again, not denying God. But, is my opponent implying that if God would ""uncloak"" himself that he could UNDERSTAND God? Is my opponent saying that he and the scientific community posses the ability to comprehend the omnipotent, Great and Mighty God. (Whom my opponent FAILS to negate existence of) Here's another example of my opponent's non-topicality: ""Surely, any God that would bother to involve himself in the affairs of one primate species in a universe teeming with over 70 sextillion stars is not as inscrutable as all that."" Again, not DENYING God, but I will attack it anyway. God CREATED us, He isn't ""bothering"" Himself with us. He Loves us and created US to love HIM. http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov...

S694fa764-Af253799e	Catholicism is Not Real Christianity	"I thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate. I regard the above statements to be accusations and/or fallacies which I will seek to qualify as such. But as the instigator of this debate and in argument for the pro position, the burden of proof lies with my opponent. [1] That being said, I ask for my opponent to define the following terms: ""prays"" (or prayer,) ""Christianity,"" ""worship,"" ""Biblical"" (or the Bible) ""The Catholic Church,"" and ""pagan."" I cannot argue statements 3 and 5 because I need specific examples to refute. For more elaborate arguments on statements 1 and 2, I will need the above terms defined. However, I will provide brief refutations. 1. It is not in the teachings of the Catholic Church for Catholics to pray ‘to' saints, to say such a linguistic error. In Catholic teaching, we simply ask the saints to pray for and with us, much like we ask our brethren on Earth to pray for and with us. We believe that we are all interconnected, acting as a single body within Christ (Romans 12:5) and that not even death can separate us from Christ and, by extension, the body of individuals within him (Rom 8:35-39). The Catholic Church breaks down the body of Christ into three broad categories. The Church Victorious, those that have achieved salvation and are in heaven, the Church Suffering, those souls in purgatory, and the Church Militant, that is, the whole contingency of people that are on Earth striving for salvation. We ""Militant"" Catholics ask those individuals in heaven to pray for us, since they are closer to God, to avoid the temptation of sin. This idea is a network, a way we have the whole of the human race helping each other gain salvation. Catholics do not worship idols. In Exodus 20:4-5 God forbids the making of images only for the purpose of worshiping them. He does not completely forbid the creating of images completely. The Old Testament is replete with statues and icons made by Jews that are loyal to God. The only use icons have in the Catholic Church is to remind us of the people and places they represent. They are just like pictures. We look at the icons to call to mind the holy deeds accomplished by God as well as the people that they affected just like we look at family pictures to remind us of past events in our familial history. 2. The largest argumentative point for this topic is the issue of Peter being the first pope. [2] We Catholics believe that Jesus made Peter the ""rock"" of his Church in Matthew 16:13-19, that is, he makes him the base-stone of a new organization. This very controversial issue takes its roots linguistically and is something that can not be solved through Koine Greek (the language of the New Testament), but the very language that Jesus spoke, Aramaic. We will however, look at the Greek first. In Matthew 16:13-19, Jesus says, ""And I tell you that you are Peter [πετρος], and on this rock [πετρα] I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."" It's curious that translators would use two different words, and this leads many to believe that Jesus is not calling Peter the rock of the church because of two different words being used. The truth of the matter is that Greek is very different from the Semitic languages, of which Aramaic is a member. [3] The reason that two different words were used was based on gender. One can not give a man a feminine name, and πετρα, while still meaning rock, is a feminine noun and can not be used for Simon, a man. Therefore, early Greek translators manipulated the word πετρα to make a masculine name, πετρος. The only problem is that there is a preexisting meaning for the masculine form, which is small stone. The feminine form takes the meaning of a large boulder, and from this gender distinction stems the debate in Peter being the rock of the church. However, Jesus spoke Aramaic, not Greek. Therefore, he would have used the word ‘כיפא' or Cephas, a word still preserved in the New Testament in places such as 1 Corinthians 1:12. Cephas has no gender issues and can therefore comfortably fulfill the meaning that Jesus intended. A new rendering of the passage shows the following: ""And I tell you that you are Peter [כיפא/Cephas], and on this rock [כיפא/Cephas] I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."" There is also a nice amount of wordplay on the name Cephas. Directly after his renaming, Peter receives the keys to the kingdom of Heaven, a symbolic representation of his new mission as the steward of the earthly Church constructed by God himself. As an interesting side note, the French Bible makes no such differentiation between Peter [Pierre] and the stone [Pierre] the sentence would thus be rendered: And I tell you that you are Peter [Pierre], and on this rock [pierre] I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."" [4] From the above information, Catholics assert that having a pope, as well as priests and bishops is biblical. Our need for the hierarchy is also based off of our need for the Sacraments. In conclusion, I believe this debate boils down to simply more miscommunication and misconceptions between Christians. To quote Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians, ""I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.""

Having priests, bishops, and a pope is not Biblical or necessary. - Covered; true (Matthew 16:13-19; John 17:11, Matthew 15:3, 6, 7) 3. The Catholic Church contradicts the Bible on many things. - Yet to be covered. 4. Catholics worship Mary. - Yet to be covered. 5. The Catholic Church has pagan roots and views. - Yet to be covered. I will now cover the remaining points. ------------------- 3. The Bible prohibits any idols (Ex. 20:4-5) http://www.truth-that-matters.com... http://www.ahnsahnghong.us... No Meat on Fridays; Lent, etc. ""Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats..."" (1st Timothy 4:1-3) -- (Also notice it says ""forbidding to marry""?; popes, priests...) The Rosary ""But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking"" (Matthew 6:7) These are a few examples of how Catholics ignore the Bible. 4. ""You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."" - 1st and 2nd Commandments. http://www.truth-that-matters.com... http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... Catholics venerate the Virgin Mary to a level of ""goddess"". The Catechism of the Catholic Church says of the Immaculate Conception of Mary: ""490. To become the mother of the Savior, Mary ""was enriched by God with gifts appropriate to such a role."" The angel Gabriel at the moment of the annunciation salutes her as ""full of grace."" In fact, in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly borne by God's grace. 491. Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware that Mary, ""full of grace"" through God, was redeemed from the moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the Immaculate Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1844: ""The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin."" (Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus, 1854.) 492. The ""splendor of an entirely unique holiness"" by which Mary is ""enriched from the first instant of her conception"" comes wholly from Christ: she is ""redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the merits of her Son."" The Father blessed Mary more than any other created person ""in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places"" and chose her ""in Christ before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him in love."" 493. The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God ""the All-Holy"" (Panagia) and celebrate her as ""free from any stain of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature"". By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life long. For more on the role of Mary in Salvation History, read the entire section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, ï¿½ï¿½ 456-511."" To see the Bible's take on the Immaculate DECEPTION, read: Romans 3:10-12, 2nd Corinthians 5:21, Hebrews 4:15, and Isaiah 64:6. There is NO Biblical reference supporting a sinless Mary. Also, Mary did not remain a virgin. ""Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not (this means he did not have relations with her) TILL SHE HAD BROUGHT FORTH HER FIRSTBORN SON: and he called his name JESUS."" -Matthew 1:24-25 (Emphasis mine). ""Is not this [referring to Jesus] the carpenter, the son of Mary, the BROTHER of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not HIS SISTERS here with us? And they were offended at him."" -Mark 6:3 (Emphasis mine). Also see: http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... 5. http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... In Genesis 10 and 11, we see parts of the story of Nimrod, who founded Babylonia. Though the Bible doesn't give much info on his story, actual Babylonian tradition does. http://www.scribd.com... Nimrod in a nutshell: He is outcasted, marries his mother, founds a great empire, dies, mother/wife claims that their child (consumed before his death), was given to her by the sun. This is the birth of false religion, or paganism. Nimrod's mother/wife was from then on called ""Queen of Heaven"", and the sun was worshipped. Priests would also wear ""fish hats"" to honor their river god. Now notice that the Catholic Mary is called ""Queen of Heaven"".

Fish hat: http://tinypic.com... http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... All pagan religions are polytheistic (have multiple gods). Technically, the Catholic Church is polytheistic. Catholic ""gods"": God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), the pope, Mary, and the canonized saints. Christian God: God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Catholicism is deeply rooted in paganism. The Catholic Church might as well be directly condemned in the Bible; just look at all the Biblical laws they break. I know I posted this before, but I feel this is an important article to read. All Catholics should read it. http://www.jesus-is-savior.com... Also read some of the linked articles near the bottom of the article.

Sae461600-Affee09a9	God is real	"In this Round I am not going to quote your arguments for the sake of saving on my word count. However, I will make it very clear to which of your points I am responding to. Unfortunately, I made a mistake when I stated that if the earth were just three feet closer to the sun, It would cause a drastic change in our planet's temperature. In fact, Like my opponent said, It would take the Earth shifting a few million miles for the Earth's surface to be completely transformed. Nevertheless, This is still a VERY small amount compared to the total distance between the earth and the sun as well as to the rest of the universe. While I was negligent in not making sure this detail was correct, My case in point remains the same. --The Earth is just the right distance from the sun, Making it habitable, And ensuring that we are able to survive on it. The idea that the Earth simply ""fell into place"" by accident is 100% impractical. There are many other examples that show our planet is an intelligent and perfect design. For instance, ""The earth's axis of rotation is tilted 231/2 degrees relative to the perpendicular of the earth's plane of orbit"" (Institute for a Creation Research). As I'm sure you're well aware, This tilt results in the four seasons. If the tilt did not exist, The surface temperature at any point on the Earth would remain the exact same throughout the year. The Earth's climate would become extreme in the equatorial areas as well as the poles and only the mid-latitudes would be habitable to humans. You are telling me that it is a mere coincidence the earth is tilted at just the right angle so that human life is sustainable on nearly its entire surface? Furthermore, I would like to add that the Earth is also perfect in size, Also indicating intelligent design. ""The Earth's size and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gases, Only extending about 50 miles above the Earth's surface"" (Every Student). Unlike the other planets, Earth is equipped with an atmosphere composed of just the right mixture of gases needed to sustain life as we know it. The existence of our atmosphere would not be possible if Earth were larger or smaller. You see, The distance from the Earth to the sun was just one of many examples showing that our universe was created perfect in order for our planet to have everything we need to survive. Ilya Prigogine was a chemist-physicist and recipient of two Nobel Prizes in chemistry. She wrote: ""The statistical probability that organic structures and the most precisely harmonized reactions that typify living organisms would be generated by accident, Is zero. "" ""After scientists discovered the vast complexities of the DNA code, And that these codes are to be found in even the most simple forms of life, They started to see ""scary visions of a God""""(Waldman, 270). I stand by my previous argument that human DNA and our genetic code was perfect in the beginning. I am stating that based on the common Christian knowledge that humans were perfect before Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden, Also known as the fall of man. This is when man's curse began which is most likely the beginning of genetic mutations. So in an essence yes, Genetic mutations are humanity's fault as God didn't intend for it to be that way. ""Every time human DNA is passed from one generation to the next it accumulates 100""200 new mutations, According to a DNA-sequencing analysis of the Y chromosome"" (International weekly journal of Science). This right here pokes a huge hole in evolution. If we are truly evolving shouldn't we be breeding up? Instead, Our DNA is constantly mutating and becoming more flawed. I understand that evolutionists have an idea that there are ""beneficial genetic mutations"". However, From what I understand there are very, Very few compared to the harmful mutations. You also claim that harmful mutations will die off faster than beneficial mutations but I found zero evidence supporting your claim. Now, In response to your rebuttal- No, I do not think I can alter my genes to ensure my offspring doesn't have genetic defects. And No, I do not think other religions and Atheists have a higher defective rate. No, I do not think God faked fossils that showed mutations. However, It is interesting you should bring up the fossil record. Could you explain this one to me? ""One of the most powerful pieces of evidence against evolution is the fossil record. If evolution occurred by slow, Minute changes in living creatures, There would be thousands of times more transitional forms of these creatures in the fossil beds than complete forms. Since the billions of fossils that have been found are all complete forms, The obvious conclusion is: Evolution never occurred! "" (Creation Today). You are absolutely correct in the fact that I cannot definitively prove God is not bound by matter or time just as I cannot definitively prove God's existence. I can only make arguments for why I believe it to be true. I only use the Bible as a reference because it holds the basic principles of my religion. There are many things I cannot prove because they require faith to understand. This is the way God intended it to be and there is nothing I can say to change that. While I can only agree that medical science is advancing. I disagree with your statement that one day humans will be able to live forever. Another result of the fall of man is that we will all receive one death. Every human in the past has died and every human in the future will die as well. I don't understand why God allows terrible things to happen. I do know God gives every person free will. I don't understand why he allows people to do terrible things to other people. I don't understand why he allows some children to starve or allows people to die of cancer. However, I do know prayer works. There are children who are starving that get adopted from 3rd world countries who thank God for rescuing them. There are people who beat the worst odds that give all of the credit to God. Hearing about women (and men for that matter) being raped and murdered is something that makes me absolutely sick. I get really angry when I hear about women in other countries being treated like animals. But you know what there's also sexual assault survivors who thank God for giving them the strength to overcome their abuse. I was assaulted by a co-worker I was closing with one night. I wasn't raped because I was able to break free and get outside. I was a pretty rebellious teenager too but God still protected me. I was also able to prevent it from happening to other girls by pressing charges and letting everyone know what he was. Instead of looking at all the bad you feel God allows to happen. Consider all the people he has saved and all the prayers he has answered! It was a pleasure debating you!"	PRO	779
Sae461600-A41432928	God is real	"It's not that the Earth 'fell into place. ' There are thousands of habitable worlds throughout the observable universe. Untold numbers. Every star you see in the sky could easily have planets in the habitable zone. It's nearly impossible for life to not exist somewhere else in our galaxy, Much less the universe. We have several other planets in our solar system. We weren't born on Mercury or Mars simply because we couldn't have been born there. Life can spring forth from planets that were formed in the habitable zone. Millions of miles is a small number in terms of solar systems, But planets being fomed in the habitable zone is not a special occurrence in the universe, Nor even terribly unlikely. 2. The axial tilt of the planet is also not that uncommon. 3 or 4 other planets in our solar system have similar axial tilts. On top of that you say it yourself: If the Earth had no axial tilt we still would have habitable areas on the planet. I'm not sure what you're going for here. Humans were not designed to live on the poles. All the tilt does is expand the habitable area on our planet. There is no evidence that you can give that were we to be born on a planet with no axial tilt we wouldn't have armored skin or be able to endure the heat. Certainly, If God existed he could make it so, And we would say that we were a superior creation to what we are now. None of this is evidence for God. It is just another fact of life, If not an argument against its existence. We could just as easily have lived on a planet where 80% of it was not habitable and you'd use a similar argument. ""Thank God 20% of our planet is habitable. "" We can't live on the water Oceans are 70% of the area of the Earth. The poles are not easily habitable. You can say about 75% of the total area of the earth is unlivable. I have no idea why you feel this is also a point in God's favor. Why did he not allow us to breathe underwater? Why not enable us to live in cold or hot environments? Why breathe at all? 3. Earth's size is also nothing special in the universe. We can include it as a factor if it really is true that it HAS to be within a certain range of sizes to have our atmosphere, But life can exist in more forms than we know. Many creatures don't require the atmosphere we have to live. You have no way of showing life doesn't exist in many other forms. There are theoretical silicone based lifeforms that would need entirely different atmospheres. Humans began to exist on this rock. That doesn't mean this rock was tailored to our needs. It means that those creatures that were born not suited to live here died. Think of the hundreds of malformed children that are born without the structures required to live. They die. There is nothing to prove that the world was created for us. There is every evidence in fossil records to show that we created our structures to suit our environments. Everything that was necessary for life to exist can be found elsewhere in the universe. That we happened to be born here is not some sort of miracle or proof for a God. It is proof that where the conditions are right for life to spring forth, It will. Nothing guaranteed that we would be here. If the dinosaurs had not gone extinct we likely would not be. None of this is proof for a God, Much less the one you profess to exist. There is no talk about axial tilts in the Bible. There is no talk about God placing the sun in just the right spot for life to exist. There is no talk about God sizing the earth properly. Are you saying God could not possibly create life on a larger planet with no axial tilt and not in the habitable zone? Of course he could. These arguments do nothing to prove your point. They only reinforce my own position. 4. 90% of the top scientists in the world don't believe in a deity of any sort. About 10% do. Do we really want to get in a quote war over this? If we're taking the opinion of top scientists then I can have 9 for every 1 you produce. There's a pretty good chance that 10% don't even agree with your god in the first place. 5. Again, If Adam and Eve didn't have ""knowledge"" already they could not have known that eating from the Apple was bad. God could have prevented this easily. God knew the snake existed. How did he expect Eve to know any better with no knowledge? It's a ridiculous stance to take that someone who could not possibly know better should be expected to know better and that not only her but ALL of humanity after her should be punished for it. After that, Jesus supposedly died for our sins, Yet the perfect DNA you have no evidence for has not sprung back into life magically afterwards. It is odd, Is it not? There can be as many harmful mutations as you'd like. There are tons. People die of cancer all over the place. Anemia is common, Et cetera. Children die of terminal defects all the time. This is where mutations that are harmful enough die off. Many beneficial mutations die off because the same person has mutations that are 'bad' enough to get them killed, Or they're just unlucky. We're talking about hundreds of millions of years of where those with bad mutations are likely to die and those with good mutations are likely to live. You keep pointing to the evidence for evolution and calling it evidence against it. I can't say I understand the viewpoint. Evolution isn't even something that disproves your God. All you have to say is that God started it. 6. You're linking me a quote from a creationist article saying there is a problem with fossils? You really ought to study sources from both sides. I have read much of answers in genesis. I have seen Ken Ham debate and I have seen Richard Dawkins debate. There are numerous transitional forms of fossils. A plethora. An abundance. I encourage you to look up the evidence for yourself. Homo erectus, Neanderthals, Etc up to homo sapiens. The transitional forms not existing is a lie cooked up by creationists. I'd need a more specific claim to be able to point to exact fossils certainly. But even the fossils we do have, If your point were entirely true, Show that humanity has improved over time, Not devolved. In reality, The position that you've taken is ""De-Evolution. "" You're saying that the further we get from Adam and Eve the more we devolve. You have zero evidence for this, Compared to the clear fossil record that shows improvements. 7. It's cool that you don't believe we can repair our bodies, But lifespans have clearly been extending as medical science improves. Life expectancy largely has increased due to it, But that is a bit of a different matter. There is nothing you can point to to show we won't be able to repair our bodies. You don't seem to have a clear understanding of how people die of ""old age"" currently. 8. Prayer doesn't work. Look up ""efficacy of prayer"" and ""studies on intercessory prayer"" on wikipedia. It has effectively been disproven that prayer works. Again, I note that you failed to respond to my question of why doesn't your church publish the results of this miracle? I submit because there was none. That is the only logical explanation. Why keep the proof of miracles all to yourself? 9. People give God all the credit for good things that happen to them and none of the blame for the bad things that happen to them. They tend to blame ""the devil, "" which is also God's creation that he could stop at any time, Or they do what you did and say there's a reason they're being punished, Or that what is happening is good for them. This keeps women in abusive homes. It is abhorrent. To conclude, You don't know why God allows terrible things to occur. You don't know the justifications for him allowing evil. You don't know why he created evil in the first place. You don't assign him blame for all the terrible occurrences, But all the credit for the good. Your entire argument is and has been a faith position. If only we would accept that there is a God we would believe in him. Faith is no virtue. -Thoht"	CON	780
Sae461600-Abcb7f2ec	God is real	"There is a lot to go over here. 1. It would take a lot more than 3 feet closer or further away from the sun to have any kind of significant difference on us. The Earth's orbit around the sun is an oval, Or ellipse. How close we are to the sun varies by around 3 million miles depending on the time of year. This is part of what causes the different seasons. There is a thing called the Goldilock's zone around every star. This is the zone in which life can exist. Not too cold, Not too hot. This is not a point in God's favor. We've found thousands of planets at this point that are in the Goldilock zone around their stars. You can wikipedia Circumstellar Habitable Zone if you'd like more on ths. 2. Our DNA is not perfect. We have thousands if not millions of errors that can occur. Cancer, Trisomy 21 (Downs Syndrome), Alzheimers syndrome, Crohn's disease, Et cetera. The existence of these errors is proof that we are not created perfectly. These errors are not simply caused by humans or the mother's choice of food et cetera. These are genetic errors. If the fault is anyone's it is God's, Were he to exist. If he did exist, He would need to explain these diseases to those he has inflicted with them. Nothing in our genes points to a creator, Certainly not an omniscient or infallible one. 3. I don't believe your education in physics is sufficient for me to accept what you've said on the 'four components of the universe. ' In fact several points I know to be false from what physics I've taken. I'm going to need your source on this before I accept it as any sort of point. Either way, Nothing you've said proves that God could have sprung from nothing by himself. The argument theists use is ""Everything that is created has a creator. "" or ""everything that is designed has a designer. "" They of course try many approaches to except their God from this, Saying he is not a design. In your analogy, You are comparing the creation of the universe to the cooking of a cake. Where did I get the ingredients for the cake from? The outside world. I didn't poof them into existence from nothing. Where did God get the ingredients for the universe? He poofed them into existence from nothing. This is the flaw in your argument. From nothing, God. I can draw the line to my creation quite far back, But then I admit I have no idea what happened previously. Your position is that you know exactly what happened. That God necessarily existed prior to the creation of the universe. It doesn't hold water. From whence did God come? This question is not answered by saying ""He had to. "" This is an argument that would work for ANY God. Not only yours. You wouldn't accept it for any other religion. Why should I accept it from you for yours? 4. God is not omnipotent. There is always a limit. Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnibenevolence, None of these traits are possibilities. Nothing has them. If you believe God is omnipotent then he must be able to create an object that he cannot move. If he can't move that object, He is not omnipotent. It is logically impossible. The problem is you're trying to use logic to prove to us that God must exist while suspending logic when it comes to God's attributes or his beginning. 5. The Big Bang did not create the universe. This is a point people don't seem to understand. There was something before the Big Bang. We aren't entirely sure what it was. There are plenty of theories. The problem is Time didn't exist, Supposedly, Previous to the big bang. But the universe certainly did. My personal opinion on it is that we will develop a theory better than the Big Bang in due time, But that doesn't change that it explains everything that happened AFTER that. The simple fact is we don't know what happened BEFORE that because the question doesn't even make sense. The Big Bang is NOT an explanation for how the universe came to exist. It is an explanation for the last several billion years. Not what came before. It is a common misconception that people have that we're saying the universe came to be because it banged itself into existence. We're saying there was a big bang, And we have no idea what happened before that. Inserting God into the equation only brings up more problems. From whence did God come? If you think God is infinite and always has been, Why can we not say that the universe is infinite and always has been? There are multiple good theories on this. One is that the universe has big bangs and big crunches in a cycle. One is that we are all in a simulation. It is in fact somewhat likely that this IS a simulation and that the being that created our simulation is effectively our God, But that would not be the God you are supposing, And I would not define that as a God, Although as close to one as is likely to exist. 6. Remission is an understood phenomena. We have immune systems. They sometimes work, Believe it or not. When you get sick and don't take medicine is it a miracle that you recover? Remission is not fully understood, But has occurred in atheists and people across every religion praying all to different gods or none at all. Why is the remission and prayers sent to your particular God more convincing than all the other prayers sent to all the other gods, Or none at all? Believe it or not, Religious people have the same rates of remission than non religious people. There have been studies done showing results when groups of people have prayed for something to occur and when they have not. Prayers have let to no improvement on the odds of recovery over large studies. In some cases, Those prayed for actually fared worse. How many times have you prayed and not got what you wanted or needed? Do you think the Christian women murdered in the Crusades got what they prayed for when they were raped and slain by other Christian men? 7. God has much to answer for, If he exists, Before I could come to accepting him as a neutral entity, Much less a good one. He would have created me knowing that I would never accept him for the disease he has allowed to exist. For the evils he has allowed to exist, That he did in fact create. Any God that exists should be fought. If it takes millennia, Billions, Quadrillions of years, Any God that exists should be wiped from the face of existence. That, Or he had better have some damned good explanations. He owes humanity explanations from all the wars that have arisen because he wouldn't come down here and clarify this quickly. For all the families he has torn asunder, For all the hearts he has broken from failing to step in when people were killed, Often slowly. For allowing his creation to degenerate and suffer. One who denies the needless suffering of humans who have done nothing to bring that suffering upon themselves is living a life of privilege beyond compare. To conclude, You have presented a case for God. I cannot present a case for a being's nonexistence, But I can and have answered the points you bring up for its existence and I attempt to show you how they are not points that favor the existence of a god. To go beyond proving a God's existence and to say that YOU have the correct God you would need to answer me why religious people from other religions seem to have the same experience and confidence in their god's existence and efficacy that you have in yours. The same belief in the miracles of their deity. Even when they are clearly in violation of one of the ten commandments of your God that no nonbeliever is guilty of breaking. If it exists, God has wrought all the diseases that plague mankind. He is not responsible for the Earth being habitable. You can argue he set off the Big Bang, But not that it did not occur. If it did occur, He has no responsibility for it. If you argue he knew it would end up like this after he Banged, You have to admit humans have no free will. He could have created any universe. He knew what would happen before he created it. Do you think no better universe could exist? -Thoht"	CON	781

Sfd336fc2-Ad7e9f7b7	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	"Imagine an infinite sheet of paper with an infinite line on it, eternal in both directions, without beginning, or end. Now if you could start at any point on this paper, and begin to draw a separate line, how long would it take to make your line as long as the first one? Even if you had forever, you still couldn""t make your line infinitely long. Why? Because your line had a beginning, and no matter how long you make it, it will always have a cut off point. This illustrates the difference between the Creator God, and the created. We will never catch up to God because he is infinitely ahead of us in all his attributes. So I do hope that Pro isn""t suggesting when he says ""become divine,"" that God""s purpose should have been for us to eventually become gods ourselves, just like him, because in that case Pro is saying that God should have attempted to do the impossible! Pro""s model involves God splitting his consciousness up into pieces, and put these pieces of himself into the first human bodies, giving himself amnesia (each person forgets he is divine), with the hope that each one will one day realize he is God, and when he does, far from achieving God""s purpose for man, he loses his individual personhood, and God is back to square one with no separate person to have fellowship with him. I believe God created man to worship him, and have a loving relationship with him. You say that God made man to experience his glory, I disagree; but even if that should have been God""s reason for making man, samsara obliterates any chance of man as the individual he is experiencing that glory, because when he comes to the realization that he was divine all along and his individuality was just an illusion, and he loses his personal existence. The personality that once existed dies, he goes out of existence. So all you are seeking by all these rebirths is your death. But in heaven, in the Christian view, God will have many people with him, forever experiencing his love, and showering him with their love, freely. How could being loved by people who freely choose to have fellowship with you be ""meaningless?"" If love, in this perfection that exists in heaven, is meaningless, how much more meaningless would our love be in this fallen, sinful world! So Pro is incorrect when he calls the bliss of heaven meaningless. Losing one""s existence is what I would call a very meaningless end to a long cycle of rebirths in Pro""s twisted version of nirvana. With reincarnation, people can""t even remember their former lives as cats or dogs so that they can learn from their mistakes. Without being able to remember the past, they may forever be in this state of reincarnation, always repeating the same mistakes, so Pro""s model mere tries to replace hell with countless rebirths that could literally go on forever. This would only give someone who is evil more opportunity to cause harm in their next life. Maybe they will be reborn as a dog and bite someone innocent. But with hell, the truly wicked are locked away for good where they can cause no more harm, forever. They only get to cause suffering to the innocent in one life time, but in Pro""s model Hitler would get to cause suffering in many lifetimes. At this point I can""t resist asking the question: when someone is reborn as a cat, what exactly do they do to redeem themselves to gain a better rebirth? Do they stop chasing rats? And what does a spider do? Does it stop spinning webs in my house? On Pro""s model, God ""never would have personally condemned anybody,"" so Pro prefers for a God, infinite in holiness and goodness, not to condemn sin? So when God sees what Hitler did to the Jews, he should not punish this man? What kind of parent does not discipline his children? On Pro""s model Jesus would not need to die, but first of all, on the Christian model he didn""t have to die either. God did not owe us salvation. He freely choose to save us, and Christ freely choose to suffer and die for our sakes. Secondly, one your model, the same person who dies today will have to die millions of times over and over again as he goes through the endless cycle of rebirths. I can""t fathom that Pro would argue that God, as he is now, should have done things contrary to his own character; so Pro must be arguing that his idea of what God should be like is better than what Christianity teaches he is like. But interestingly, Pro is a Buddhist, and Buddhist don""t believe in a personal God! Pro proposes a model that makes no sense whatsoever. He says the more like God you are, the more bliss-filled your life becomes. So in a world where men have free will, what is to prevent someone from persecuting those who are like God? Will their free will be taken away? Or will the righteous only get this bliss in the next life? If so, how do you know they will be any better off in the next life when the baby born without memory of his past bliss-filled life is starting from scratch all over again? But if you are reborn as an ant, God didn""t make you that way, samsara did it, and who created samsara and programmed it to make people like you into ants in the next life? God! So Pro is saying he prefers a model where God contradicts himself. Pro says that ""as soon as he grows weary of this separation he will seek God's law,"" but how can he grow weary of lives he can""t remember? If the purpose of these rebirths is to get a chance to do better, without knowing what past acts one is being punished for, how can one repent and improve? Or will you now try to amend what the Buddhists actually teach to make your model better? All people have to do to be saved is to repent, and give their hearts to Jesus as their Savior. They won""t live up perfectly to all that he requires all the time, but God gives them the strength they need to live a live that honors him. All we need is the desire to do what is right, and God gives us the strength to do it. And in heaven, having perfect bodies that are free of sinful lusts, it will be easier to do what is right throughout eternity; so yes, heaven accomplishes more than what samsara does. Pro prefers God to have created us ""so that Love could become known by someone who was previously ignorant,"" but on his model, God himself has to become the one who is ignorant by inhabiting these bodies and giving himself amnesia. God himself would be the one, on Pro""s model, who enslaves the blacks, killed Jews in the holocaust, raped women, told lies, and invented the doctrine of hell, all because of his own self inflicted ignorance when he divided his consciousness into subjective parts. If God himself were the author of all this, how then does Pro have a problem with hell? In Buddhist terms, the basic idea of salvation is liberation from the laws of Karma and samsara, as well as the attaining of Nirvana. What is Nirvana? The word itself is said to mean ""blowing out, extinguishing."" Thus, some define Nirvana as cessation of all passion and desire; an existence free from all sensory feelings, such as pain, fear, want, love, or hate; a state of eternal peace, rest, and changelessness. Essentially, it is said to be the cessation of individual existence. The Buddha taught that enlightenment and salvation""the perfection of Nirvana""come, not from any God or external force, but from within a person by his own effort in good deeds and right thoughts. This raises the question: Can something perfect come out of something imperfect? If no one is able to have total control of his actions even in simple day-to-day matters, is it logical to think that anyone can work out his eternal salvation all by himself? Just as a man mired in quicksand is not likely to free himself from it on his own, likewise all mankind is entrapped in sin and death, and no one is capable of extricating himself from this entanglement. (Romans 5:12) This is why God has to come down to save us, but on Pro""s model we have to save ourselves. No, the Christian model beats samsara any day."	CON	784

It shall enhance the fury and power my grand argument possesses. ~ ~ ~ Now, playtime has finished. It is time to utterly annihilate christianity. Time and time again thou has failed to grasp the meaning of this debate. I have tricked thee and thou hath plummeted into my trap. I have created a character identical to God. The God whom you believe in. The character I have devised is Santa. Instead of pointing out God's flaws to thee myself, I have fooled thee into finding God's flaws yourself. Thou hast criticized Santa's logic. Thou hast criticized Santa's actions. Thou has criticized Santa's powers. In reality, thou hast criticized God himself. All of your criticism of Santa applies directly to God. This is because I crafted the character of Santa to be EXACTLY the same as God. The only difference between my character of Santa, and God is that you do not believe in Santa. Therefore your first instinct was to demonstrate to me that Santa does not exist. In doing so thou has only proven that God does not exist. Congratulations, thou has debated as an atheist, only this time instead of debating for God's non-existence thou has debated for the nonexistence of God only under another name. Your failed logic in this debate has consisted of this. First, thou pointed out the illogical flaws of my belief in Santa Claus. Then, thou gave explanations to defend God when I pointed out that God has the same illogical flaws. Now, I ask, why do the explanations that thou used to cover God's flaws, not cover Santa's flaws as well? It is interesting that thou criticized Santa in this way if thou already knew the explanation to these flaws. Now, I shall summarize the debate to demonstrate that CON has been my puppet, and I... the master. First, I lured CON to enter the debate about a mythical character that CON knew would be easy to obliterate. Next, I gave Santa all the powers that are possessed by God and I made Santa act the same way God did. I knew that CON would criticize these powers and actions because they are ridiculous. CON bombard Santa (God) with criticism. Then, I used the same criticism that CON used to destroy Santa and I used it against God. Suddenly, CON had a defense for each and every one of these criticisms. Sorry, to inform thee but it does not work like that. Either you revoke all criticism for both Santa and God or you keep it and prove that both are imaginary. Also, here are errors made by CON throughout this debate. ~ ~ 1. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... CON makes exceptions to explain why it is acceptable for God to do something that CON has already stated is not acceptable for Santa to do. Example: ""God indeed doesn't need prayers. Prayers is just something we Christians do, to acknowledge God, to attain his blessing, to communicate to him, and gain wisdom. God did not request Prayers."" I could say the same about Santa's wish lists, yet, before CON defended God, CON criticized the need for Santa's wish lists. This is a clear example of the bias CON has for believing in God and how desperately he attempts to hold onto his belief. 2. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... CON has mentioned that God is a common widespread belief, when in reality that is irrelevant. 3. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com... I suspect that CON does not understand my arguments. My evidence for this claim is the fact that CON continues to point out the illogical nature of my now irrelevant arguments that I made in the first few rounds. CON does not understand that these arguments were not real, and instead they were to mimic the way a christian would debate. ~ ~ ~ Time for rebuttals 1. You say that ""God will not do anything you ask."" Then why pray? Just saying though, what about this, ""And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son."" 2. Sending wish lists is just something we do to acknowledge Santa. Why did you criticize Santa if you knew the answer beforehand? 3. ""God does not need to answer prayers 100% of the time"" Hmmm. Interesting. But you criticized Santa for not answering 100% percent of the time. You said that Santa should be able to because he is omnipotent. Isn't God Omnipotent also? According to your logic God should also answer 100% of the time. Why are you contradicting yourself? 4. You say God has already proved his existence. How? Through an old book? Any logical person wouldn't deem that to be enough evidence. Just because the generations before us claim that this book is true is not enough evidence. Do you think it is right for someone to suffer torture for all eternity just because they could get themselves to believe in something that has no evidence other than a highly questionable book. Even people who are no where near the intelligence of the great God who is so loving and good, are smart enough to realize that torture is wrong. People know that it is not right to torture someone that steals. Someone that sells illegal drugs. Even someone that kills another person. People are smart enough to know that torture is not right. And that is just a little bit of torture. Nothing compared to an entire eternity of torture. Would you say that not believing in God is anywhere near as bad as killing someone? Yet, God tortures non-believers for eternity. What kind of irrational monstrous God do you believe in? 5. You are quite the hypocrite. You say that Santa's thinking is flawed when he doesn't care about starving people, but God, his thinking isn't flawed at all. Just because a few people are ""sinful"" means that God has the right to put innocent people through the horrible agony of starvation? Here is a thought. Maybe people wouldn't be ""sinful"" if God gave them a good life. (CON SKIPPED IN HIS NUMBERING) 7. CON originally criticized Santa's elves by saying that the elves have higher technology then humans but the toys are still the same. I responded by saying that God supposedly has superior intelligence yet his actions indicate the same intelligence as humans. (actually much lower intelligence.) CON's ridiculous rebuttal was ""God always has a plan."" CON mentions that the Bible predicted Jesus's coming 2,500 years beforehand. How is this supposed to demonstrate God's incredibly advance and FAR superior knowledge, logic, and reasoning? If God were a person living today he would be ridiculed for being racist, sexist, and for having extreme anger issues. The reason that God acts this way is because he was made up by man thousands of years ago. At the time morals were next to nothing, and because of this, it was acceptable for God to act the way he does in the Bible. There are so many examples that show God's lack of intelligence. God is so dumb that he made two humans and told them not to eat from one tree. When he is not watching they eat from the tree. What did he expect? These people are literally new to Earth. They know nothing about manners. They have never been taught. How could God expect them to know how to follow rules. Then God is so dumb that he punishes every human that will ever live for all eternity just because of this one event. To further prove God's lack of intelligence, God kills people without regret just because they were ""sinning."" Is it a coincidence that at the time killing people for no reason was completely acceptable? If God were actually smart like he is described to be, then he would teach people to not sin. And if for some reason that didn't work, he can threaten them without actually violently killing them. I'm pretty sure that a threat from God, the most powerful being in the universe, should be enough to change someone. 8. So, you criticize Santa for having to go to a lab to be experimented on when he could've used his omniscience but then you say that it is fine for God to not give out his information using omniscience because God can do anything he wants. How can you criticize Santa for something and then say it is fine of God to do the same thing. Talk about double standards. Also, you are fine with following a God that is allowed to kill everyone if he wants. Interesting. I'd rather believe in nothing then in a psychopath that can not manage his anger and is so unpredictable that he could turn on you at any second. You say that God is proven scientifically. How do you know that the science that proves God actually proves Santa's existence instead? Maybe Santa made the DNA. You say God is logically proven. How? Logically Santa makes more sense. Tell me, what evidence ""proves"" God that doesn't also prove Santa. This debate is over. Santa does not exist. God does not exist. I can say that Santa does not exist because I do not believe in God. If I were to believe in God then I can not say that Santa does not exist because the same amount of evidence supports both. You however must believe in Santa because you believe in God. If you believe in God then you must also believe in Santa because both are supported by the SAME EXACT evidence. Mathematically If.. A = the supporting evidence that proves B = the probability of God's existence C = the probability of Santa's existence A=B and A=C then B=C This means that I will win the debate because you believe in Santa. If you believe in Santa then I win. CON believes in Santa Claus so... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE PRO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Just remember CON...

Sa677f7ca-Ac248d3d1	All religion is wrong yet also correct. What if the real religion of God is seen by looking at all.	"Thank you batman01 for choosing my debate. Also this is my first debate so it might be a little sporadic. So point 1. Forms of power. In the bible it is said that the devil took the form of a snake to deceive Adam and Eve, it also says that God is the holy trinity. So my connection is God has 3 ""forms"" what if God also took the form of the different gods in Greek mythology, or took the for of Brahman, in Hinduism, and his many forms to show his power to others. So what I'm getting at in this point is maybe the bible is the start and Greek mythology and Hinduism are parts along the way. Point 2. Jesus and Budda. Both important people in their religions, what if they are the same person under two names. What if Budda is Jesus trying to connect with his people, and then later on tried to reveal him self and it didn't quiet work out the way he planned (this goes into another philosophy I have about God having more than one plan to get us somewhere, and since we've been deceived by the devil that even we surprise him, but that a whole other thing). Also what if the Ten Commandments, of Christianity, are the rules for the eight folds paths, Buddism. Point 3. Islamic and Christianity. Both believe in One God, and in believe in hell. Both believe that there is a Holy Book, Bible and the Qur'an. Belief in prayer, and declaration of faith. Both have a place of worship Church and Mosques. Point 4. Christianity and Judaism. Well Christianity has the same bible just with the New Testament added on, and what if Jesus was just a prophet of God. Let's think about this it is said that God created the universe and everything in it, so if you look at that and think where the devil did the devil come from. Well God created him, and what if he created Jesus. A yin yang situation, and the bad in side the good is the forbidden tree in the garden, and good inside the bad is Jesus went through hell. So I say Jesus is a prophet of God, his most trusted creation and that he is like a son to him. This is just connecting the top religions of the world that I have thought about and connected, given I am a Christian so I can not at this moment in time connect them all to each other so I have connected them to one religion."

Sd63073be-Ac9192e6f	The Many Worlds Interpretation can resolve the problem of Hell	Thank you for accepting my challenge Bluesteel My opponent's argument that it is possible for God to be omnibenevolent in another world while not in this world depends on the idea that God is subject to the Quantum events which is logically impossible since if God can be affected by Quantum events then he must also affect them through his observation of the universe, which would not allow the interference pattern that was seen in the double slit experiment. My opponent is correct in saying that God would not be omnibenevolent in this world unless recent discoveries in quantum mechanics are taken into account. In the traditional Christian worldview, a person can be saved or damned, only one or the other, based on their decision of whether or not to accept Christ. However, recent discoveries show that all possible outcomes play out which renders the traditional worldview logically impossible, so at the moment someone is told about Christ, both outcomes, the person accepting and rejecting Christ, play out. Which also resolves another logical problem in Christianity, if a person sins their entire lives and then accepts Christ on their deathbed and goes to heaven, how can God be just? When quantum mechanics is taken into consideration, it shows that everyone who is given the chance to accept Christ simultaneously goes to Heaven and pays for their sins.	PRO	793

S224da923-Ada824ba7	soccer: barcelona is currently better than real madrid	"Any team that loses the likes of Huntlerlaar, Robben, Heize, Cannavaro and Van Nistelrooy whilst gaining the likes of Kaka, Ronaldo, Benzema and Alonso is going to be a radically different team."" 1- This backs up my point that both teams began going through changes from 2008-2009 and Barcelona won 6 championships with some new players just like Madrid but the different was that Barcelona obviously played more as a team rather than each player playing on his own. I remember when the new real Madrid team first played each player was trying to show off and show that they are better than each other rather than play as a team. Also Barcelona won 5 trophies in 2010-2011 so they still are the best rather than were the best. Also if we look at this years game its true Madrid is doing very well in all its matches except against Barcelona. In the Cope Del Rey cup 2 matches Barcelona won one and tied with Madrid. In the la liga Barcelona won one of the 2 matches. Madrid still has no win against Barcelona. Also ill say this to keep it simple for you, 2008-2009 6 trophies, 2009-2010 1 trophy, 2010-2011 5 trophies. So This by itself is screaming Viva Barcelona. ""making it sound as if Madrid made a tactical mistake rather than being an inferior team"" 2- the fact that they did that every game they played against Barcelona except the last one proves that Barcelona is better and again I didn't say that they were inferior because again real Madrid and Barcelona over the many years they played against each other each team proved to be the best at a certain point. The fact that they made this tactical mistake proves that Barcelona is the better team. Also adding to this point in every game Barcelona also positions the ball more than Madrid. "" Goal.com even stated that Madrid were the better side during the opening half and Barcelona's goals were against the run of play(3). None of the recent games between the sides have shown a clear superiority for Barcelona."" 3- I'm glad you finally said that they did better the first half because that just prove that you agree with my previous statement that the second half Madrid began to foul and play dirty and the only clean goal was Benzima goal over puyol so this clarifies that Barcelona even under the pressure of Madrid managed to score 2 goals where the second goal was a great shot over the defense of Madrid in to the top right corner of the goal. All the recent games prove that Barcelona dominated the fact that they won 2-1(first match in cope del rey) 3-1 (first match in the la liga) 2-2(last match in cope del rey and as I mentioned before first half Barcelona score under pressure and then second half they get fouled a lot and if I remember correctly they even injured an Barcelona player) 4- I won't stress on this much because even all ronaldo fans know that messi is better and the video you posted was when he was in Manchester and I agree when he was in Manchester he was way better than how he is in Madrid. Its true is doing well but again messi has better foot work and more assists and easily goes past players and overall plays much better than ronaldo in each game. Ronaldo is a bad player but between him and messi is only goal difference. Barcelona and Madrid, madrid only has more goals. 5- lastly as I said before its true Madrid has the lead in la liga but it hasn't beat Barcelona once in this league. they did do good in the champion league qualification but I didn't see a challenging team in its group and it got high than Barcelona only by 2 points also Barcelona had AC Milan in its group so I think Barcelona did just as good as Madrid and right now they are in the knockout stage well see how it goes from there. good for Madrid since it scored more goal in the last la liga leagues but Barcelona won both of them and that all that matters. also Barcelona never lost once to Madrid in any of the previous la liga that you mentioned so still proving that Barcelona is better and I don't what Spanish or non Spanish defenders have to do with Barcelona being better but we will have to wait and see what will happen each of the current open leagues to see if its Madrid turn to truly shine because currently Barcelona hasn't lost once to Madrid and that alone proves it to be the best."

S2acec618-A9481939c	Fat Catholics are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL	"I""m not a Catholic myself but I do know that both GLUTTONY and SLOTH are two of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS (1). Neither am I a doctor I but I also know that the primary causes of obesity are also GLUTTONY and SLOTH (2). However, fat Catholics can make a gesture of penitence to the LORD by regularly fasting. As it is written in the Bible ""And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, we have sinned against the LORD"" (1 Samuel 7:6) As well as pleasing the LORD, fasting will also help obese SINNERS lose weight, which would be good for their health and thus enable them to live longer lives, ""for the wages of sin is DEATH."" (Romans 6:23). I believe priests have the religious duty to guide their flocks by determining how long and how often fat Catholics should fast. The Bible gives examples of one-day, three-day, seven-day and forty-day fasts (Judges 20:26, Esther 4:16, 1 Samuel 31:13 and Matthew 4 respectively) so priests might determine that a fat SINNER who had let themselves go a bit by scoffing a few too many curries and supping a too much beer, and who had failed to renew their gym membership, might be compelled to complete a one-day fast every month, while longer and more frequent fasts would be allocated to the even more greedy and lazy members of their congregations. Catholics believe that when they die they are interviewed by the LORD (or one of his officially appointed representatives such as Saint Peter) and that, during that meeting, they are challenged to account for their lives and prove that they have duly repented of their all their SINS. That means that, no matter what good deeds an overweight Catholic may have performed during his life, if some big fat pile of sweating blubber who died of a self-inflicted, obesity-related illness turns up at the Pearly Gates and takes his place in the line behind some poor little African kid who died of starvation because the grossly overweight guy behind him had consumed far more than his fair share of the planet's finite food resources, there is no way the obese bloke is going to convince anyone that he deserves a place in the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, for in addition the GLUTTONY and SLOTH, GREED is another of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS. It may seem harsh, but woe betide fat Catholics for they are miserable SINNERS and those who refuse to fast are doomed to burn in HELL for all eternity. Thank you. (1) http://deadlysins.com...

Se0ba8977-A82d48509	Christianity is the ONLY true religion with a REAL God.	A religious label, scripture, and different words used for God that people use to set apart their religion from another's is not of any consequence if theological principals lead to the same end. It's a matter of semantics to claim your religion and your God as the only truth; rather than see that all faithful people are working toward the same end. They are all taking about the same entity no matter what word they use. The various prophets of religion claim to have heard the word of God. But, keep in mind the context of when these individuals lived. They interpreted events in the environment of the era in which they lived and within the sphere of the culture in which they belonged. How they mentally processed these communications are radically different due to these elements, which factors into dissimilar interpretive ideology (beliefs). Previous to the Bronze Age much of the population was transient or in small farming clusters where religious teaching was primarily through oral tradition. As the Middle East became more urbanized writing became symbolic of status which religious leaders used to gain authority. As power shifted regionally and within religious communities, religions became more fragmented. One religion grew into another or split into new ones throughout history. Many have mythology and beliefs that parallel because they have the same in origin. Differences are a mere result of a sect's differential development over time. In the Far East similar religious evolutions were taking place. Religious development is akin to other man made items; advancements made in building technology to computers. Religion has had its own developmental path rooted in, and built upon previous ancient religions merging and divergent. Religious division is the difference between an Apple and Dell computer; it's same thing with different operating systems. On the science point that you alluded to previously; I've done some research on the topic and deduced that much that's been written is the usage of Bible passages loosely attached to scientific terms. There are no details or scientific data to back up claims. Simply, there's a whole lot of conjecture and wishful interpretation being done. There's nothing that cannot be attributed to what was already known about natural occurrences during Biblical times; water has waves and the waves are bigger during a full moon, the numbers of stars in the sky are uncountable, seeds will grow if planted, and vapor (smoke) is emitted and lightening occurs during volcanic eruptions. Many other religious texts say much the same. To this point there has been no evidence to prove that Christianity is the only true religion with a real God.	CON	806

Sd3b36db4-A24c4ed7f	Homosexuality is a sin and if one continues in the sin, then it will sadly lead that person to hell.	"Many people in our world do not understand the concept of ""love."" One would have to do an enriching studying in the Bible on the word ""love"" because the nature of God is that He is love (1 Jn. 4:8): ""He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."" Love is doing what is best in that person's interest. Look closely how Paul describes the nature of love in 1 Cor. 13:4-7:""Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."" 2 Pet. 3:9 states: ""The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."" John 3:16 states: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."" God has gone ""out of His way"" to express His everlasting love in the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, on the cross of Calvary. He loves human beings so much, so much, that we cannot ever comprehend it! Hell was originally prepared for Satan and his minions. Matt. 25:41 states: "" ""Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Sadly, Satan has deceived all of us into going our own way and leading us away from God. Rom. 3:9-12: ""What then? Are we better than they? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. As it is written: ""There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands;There is none who seeks after God.They have all turned aside;They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one."" God truly wants to show true purpose and meaning in our lives if we are willing to come to Him in faith and obedience (which is expressed much fuller what God wants us to do in order to be saved) as I have already stated in my other debate: ""Is Immersion Essential For Salvation From Sin Under the Christian Age?"" Sin should be shameful to each and every one of us. Jer. 6:15 states: ""Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed; Nor did they know how to blush."" I am not picking on one particular sin. If I need to, I will do other debates concerning that: ""adultery is a sin..."" (Gal. 5:19-21), ""lying is a sin"" (Rev. 21:8), etc. as I have stated in this proposition. I am not attacking the person. I am attacking the sin. This sin can cause so much damage to ourselves, among others, and among society. Let me point out what the Scriptures state on homosexuality. Rom. 1:24-28 states: ""Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting"" Gal. 5:19: "" Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness"" 1 Cor. 6:9-11: ""Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."" Jude 7: ""as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."" The Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. It is a sin that transgresses the eternal law of God. God's justice will be rendered out on such perversity. But God also is kind, loving, merciful, and is willing to show long-suffering, if homosexuals will realize what they have done and are willing to repent of their sin and turn to a life of true repentance. That what happened to some of those who lived in Corinth who became Christians. Their sins were washed away through immersion because they were willing to surrender to God their lives from a life of sin to a life of righteousness (1 Cor. 6:9-11). Isn't that wonderful ""good news""? You bet it is! I pray that every homosexual will begin to realize the life they are living in that they will turn to God. It is not just homosexuals, but also adulterers, thieves, etc. What a wonderful world this would be if people would change their lives to living as God would want them to live."	PRO	812

For clarification of what I mean by God and religion I will provide definitions from Oxford Dictionary: God: 1. (in Christianity and other monotheistic religions) the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being 2.(in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshipped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity. 3.An image, animal, or other object worshipped as divine or symbolizing a god religion: 1.The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods 2.A particular system of faith and worship 3.A pursuit or interest followed with great devotion From these definitions it is clear that Pastafarianism fits the definition of religion perfectly. Pastafarians believe in The Flying Spaghetti Monster (blessed be his Noodliness) who created The Universe as we know it (see the definition of 'God'). Their central believes are all written down in The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster holy book of Pastafarians (simillary to the way Bible is the holy book for Christians) where it is clearly written that he is in fact a God despite the fact that he is unobservable. Among other similarities with other 'mainstream' religions is our celebration of every Friday, that is a holy day for us the same way Sunday is such a day for Christians. While religion in particular was not a part of the original debate topic I felt the need to mention it as it is very closely related to the the 'potential' Godness of The Flying Spaghetti Monster (blesses be He for He boiled for our sins). I think at this point we have established that The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the creator of all that is, thus He logically also has powers that from our point of view are supernatural and He is worshiped by many people across the world (100 000 holy books have been sold to believers all over the world)[1]. This fits the definition of the term God perfectly therefore is a sufficient proof. Some people might object that The Flying Spaghetti Monster (may His meatballs never get cold) is not truly a God for He is not actually worshiped by people and is meant as a satiric representation of other Gods and churches. To those people I would like tell two things. First one is that you will most likely end up in hell where the beer is always stale. And second is that if he or she can, he/she should scientifically prove that this is true for every single Pastafarian who professes his/her believe. If he or she can't do that than I or anyone else for that matter could claim that Gods such as Allah are also merely satirical representations of older Gods and religions and so on.

S7908009f-A3e9bd935	God is Real, Evolution isn't	"You say that the evolution theory is called a theory because it is nothing more than a theory. It is not just a theory, it is an undeniable reality. It has never, to my knowledge, been proven wrong. Due to the abundance of evidence surrounding it, it has far more credibility than your theory of man being created from dust. Over one hundred caveman skeletons have been found. Probably more, it's just a rough estimate. We can see from their anatomy that they are not the modern species of human, and not exactly an ape. They are something in between. The first caveman skeletons were discovered, coincidentally, during an era of scientific enlightenment. People were finally starting to put the shackles of religion behind them, and discover other ways of looking at the world. One thing I think is sick, however, is the 1920s case in which a teacher was brought to trial for teaching children evolution. https://en.wikipedia.org... This shows that Christianity is intolerant to other opinions, and, at this point in history, it was illegal to spread the truth. I don't think it's funny, I think it reflects the fractured psyche of a disgusting society. If I lived during this era, I'd hang up posters of Darwin all over. Nothing to do with the argument, really, I just thought I'd point it out. Your ignorance is once more shown when you assert that the development of wings on birds had no direct advantages. It had many advantages. There were many dangers to prehistoric birds, many fearsome creatures who could eat them. By flying, they were able to nest where fearsome predators could not reach them, and thus, they manages to avoid extinction. Everything in the evolutionary process has some kind of advantage. Your ignorance is shown again when you say that birds could not change. Once more, you wrongly assume that evolution is a quick process. Something does not evolve in the same animal, simple genetic traits are very gradually altered within a species. Due to your religious upbringing, you confuse ""The world being created in seven days"" with the actual creation of the world. Biological processes don't happen quick. The universe has existed for an unimaginable amount of time. Another flaw to your bird argument is that you assume the things before birds didn't have wings. Birds were evolved from dinosaurs, and some were probably evolved from pterodactyls, which were already quite adept at flying. There was probably never a bird with only half a wing. The wings grew out gradually, about a millimeter per generation, and the bird was patient while the wings grew in. You assume that the growth of wings on birds was a cognitive process. they did not choose how to evolve. Nothing decides to evolve, it simply happens, over millions of years. Birds, as you pointed out, grew hollow bones to become more aerodynamic, but they did not decide to, it was born out of necessity. They needed to fly, so they did. You also compare flying birds to flying humans, declaring that both are impossible. We cannot fly because it defies the laws of physics. We have too high a body mass and our arms don't have enough surface area. Birds have a low body mass and a wide wingspan, so they can fly. It's not just an insane coincidence that birds fly, they do so through the use of science, such as physics, the study of motion, and a series of complicated mathematical equations involving gravity and so on. Once more, it all boils down to science. But you don't care, you choose instead to cling to your religion. Humans have not evolved wings because we had no reason to. Unlike birds, we were capable of killing a saber toothed tiger or some other predator, we did not have to fly away. We were too heavy to nest in trees, and we preferred a hunter gatherer system. Wings were not necessary for us. We might still evolve them, but that could be millions of years away. You seem to put a lot of ridicule towards the idea of flying humans for a person whose religion revolves almost completely around flying humans. That's what angels are. All plants, animals, and insects are in a continual state of change, it's just so slow we don't notice it. And just so you know, insects are a type of animal according to the five biological kingdoms of living things. No two creatures or human are identical. There are roughly 8.7 million species currently on this world, including bacteria, and every member of each species has a different personality. You can see that God couldn't have created all these animals, it would be too much work. You can see that these millions of animals could only have been the result of eons of evolution. Look at the bible. Of course, it only mentions bears, lions, and dogs, because those were the only animals that humanity knew at the time. Once we began to spread out, though, we discovered new species. Since the bible does not mention 8.7 million species, it can not be used as a reliable resource. According to Noah's ark, Noah had to get two of every animal. Nobody living, even today, could manage to collect every species of animal from a catastrophic flood, and if there really was an apocalyptic event like that, the results would be much more noticeable. Finally, your flawed argument involving anatomy. You think, for some unclear reason, that evolution only started with one of three things: a heart, blood, or blood vessels. I'm not sure why you consider the circulatory system as an accurate representation of all anatomy, but you're completely wrong besides that. You must understand that there are other forms of anatomy than ours. Cows have four stomachs. Your reliance on human anatomy shows how little we think of other beings. I'll try to explain how evolution could exist without a heart or blood. The first living things were one celled organisms which dwelled in the abyss of oceans. They were relatively similar to modern bacteria, and they had very little anatomy, besides some genetic information and chemical compounds. These one celled organisms multiplied, and became much larger, until fish appeared. Fish began to have the anatomy we know today, then the fish came onto land, and turned into dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are a type of reptile, so by this point they had recognizable organs, and then the dinosaurs died out and mammals came out, and it's been that way ever since. By the time of the first human like creatures, their anatomy was very much the same, with a working circulatory system and all the other organs we rely on. Throughout the eons, animals have been able to live on their own, without any parts missing. they developed reproduction as a way to ensure the existence of their species. Everything can, in some way or another, be explained using science. I await your last argument. Please try to make sense."	CON	821

I will not respond to it in this round because this round will be dedicated to arguments only. Since my opponent has stated an argument in R1 (technically) that means that I am allowed to as well. Arguments The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky (after the Sun), as measured by illuminance on Earth's surface. Although it can appear a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and mythology. The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an apparent sizein the sky almost the same as that of the Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant. Have you ever noticed that the Moon is covered in craters? Well, that’s because it gets pounded by meteorites, protecting Earth from some of the rocks that head our way. With the Moon annihilated, we’re now also more vulnerable to space rocks. Of course, one of the Moon’s most noticeable effects is the tides. With the Moon no longer there, the oceans of the world become much calmer. The Sun still has an effect on them (known as solar tides), so surfers wouldn’t be completely devoid of waves. But the oceans would largely become serene. This has a dire effect on life on Earth. When life first formed on Earth in tidal pools, it was thanks to the gravitational pull of the Moon that primordial life was able to traverse between different pools and generally spread across the planet. While we’re already here now, life that is currently in the oceans is no longer able to move so easily. The churning of the oceans, and thus the circulation of nutrients, ceases. Water-based life struggles to survive and, eventually, thousands (and probably millions) of species go extinct. You see, it also accounted for about one-eightieth of the Earth-Moon mass system. The loss of the Moon directly affects the Earth’s orbit, rotation and wobble. Without the Moon to act as a stabiliser, the Earth begins to wobble more and more, sending our seasons into turmoil and changing our orbit around the Sun from slightly elliptical to massively elliptical. We now swing around the Sun in a wild, unstable, fluctuating orbit. It proven that if the moon never existed we would have an 8 hour day! Faster spinning would create faster winds! Only wind resistant life would exist. No birds would exist. No tall trees would grow. Creatures would have to be short and low down, including us. Without the moon we wouldn't have... - Our concept of a month - A bright night sky - Space race - Moon walking (or at least the name) - Wearwolves (maybe it wouldn't be so bad....) Therefore the moon exists. Unless my opponent can prove these arguments wrong they have lost this debate. Sources https://www.google.co.uk... https://www.google.co.uk..."	CON	832
S9e30175f-A80a08d91	Evolution is a Real Thing	"I agree with all the definition and that evolution is not a fact. However, is it a theory? A theory begins as a hypothesis, if the hypothesis is not disproved it becomes a theory. We have limited knowledge, and as we gain more knowledge the theory may or may not be disproved. Both issue about evolution being labeled a Theory arise due to the definition of ""theory"" itself. Ask yourself, is the theory still not falsified? Well, as you said, back to the drawing board. But what is the next thing after that? Anything to support the hypothesis? Issue #2 is that evolution isn't a theory, they are theories mixed together. Therefore, there is no definitive theory of evolution due to the sheer amount of theories the term carried. Lets go over the theories one by one. The first one was spontaneous generation, that non-living matter can produce living things. A popular example was maggot appearing spontaneously in rotting meat, but scientists later learned that flies carry the larvas which grow into maggots. Lewis Pastor refuted the theory and said that it may not raise again. Next was Lamarckismtrait since Darwin was inspired by Lamarck, it states that the child gains the traits his parents acquired in their lives. So if a man lost his finger, then his children will have deformed fingers. If a black smith grows muscles, then his children will have a similar muscles tone when they grow up. if a giraffe extends it's neck to eat from a tree, the offspring will have a slightly longer neck. But this was refuted along with natural selection due to genetics. neo-Darwanism was born since a period passed where no one, even Darwin could come up with a theory better than Lamarckism. Darwanism was in a bad shape that brought desperation, that is how Ernst Haeckel's embryology and the Piltdown man we created. One thing I never could understand was the peppered moths. In case it was true, what is the difference from shooting black and white rabbits in snow? Camouflage offer protection, so where is the evolution? Moths stayed moths. But that is not it all, it is pretty much a fraud. Peppered moths don't rest on tree trunks, they usually hide in a hard to find place on top of trees and they only fly during the night. This proves that the pictures are glued moths. Furthermore, one of the main predators of moths are bats, and birds see in ultraviolet ""Bird vision"", which renders the argument useless. After an effort to revive evolution, mutation was incorporated in the equation to counter genetic stability. But there is one problem, mutation is random error. You might as well say that a short circuit can upgrade your graphic card or an earthquake can improve the building's structure. Countless mutation experiments on fruit flies only produced sick and weak ones, mutation is dangerous as radiation is not going to produce an X-Man with cancer, but a high number of birth defects. Just ask the people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl. Genuine mutations are extremely rare in nature, So the new backbone of natural selection: 1- Is completely random and almost always causes harm to the creature. 2- Adds no new information, just distorts the genetic code or destroy it. so it may grew extra organs creating freaks of nature, but not a new type of organ. 3- Acquired mutations will not pass to the next generation. One of the most famous evidence of beneficial mutation is the sickle-cell disease/anemia. Basically your blood cells are deformed giving you sickness (thus the disease in the name) The syndromes include making it hard to breathe and shortening your life span to the 40s. So how is it beneficial? Basically, you have protection from malaria because the parasite can't find a healthy blood cell. The argument is similar to telling someone who was born unable to walk: ""You have a beautiful trait! Thanks to your condition, you can't cross the street, thus you will never have a pedestrian accident!"" As for fossils, well... they are semi theories. Look at this picture here, This is apparently the evolution of whales science have proved(?). http://itsmyocean.org... And yet, a complete whale was found before being formed. http://www.nbcnews.com... Which asks the question: What is the basis of fossil-based proofs? I'd say they are trying to play jigsaw with hundreds of dead species and then act like it is an unquestionable fact rather than possibility. Way to ride the bandwagon. As for vestigial organs. the ignorance of function doesn't prove the lack of it, this list is continuously shrinking down as more discoveries are being made. As you can see, the evolution ""theory"" is not a good one, and it failed to provide decent thesieses in order to support itself. It makes use of the ideology of wishful thinking. Which makes me wonder, did the theory become more important than the evidence?"	CON	833

I do not believe that spontaneous generation is possible, I am merely saying that it is similar to evolution its self. The only difference between the two is that in evolution beings change over a period of time. Were as in spontaneous generation, living things seem to be created instantly, usually out of non living things. That is of course impossible. Examples of evolution are all around you. Have you ever come across the details within Darwin's Theory of Evolution. It shows an experiment that he conducted on a tropical island. He noticed that there were several different species of finches living on different parts of the island. Each type of finch had a unique bodily structure based on their surroundings. For example, one finch had an abnormally long beak compared to the other types of finches. It had gotten the beak over time, because the bugs in that area of the island burrowed in logs, and in order for that species of finch to survive, it had to adapt and grow a longer beak in order to reach deeper into the trees, and get food.

They are using Ernst Haeckel's embryology as proof! http://i479.photobucket.com... Better yet. They credited Micheal Richardson, the man who EXPOSED the scam, lol. An other example of how evolution fossils are a joke is the coelacanth fish. They believed that it is a transnational fossil, I mean look! It have two extra fins, and it it seems to be developing a brain and a primitive lungs, and it probably lived near the surface! It was extinct 70 millions years ago! But opps... the first one was caught in south Africa in 1938 the reason being that the fish does not rise above 180 meters below water surface, they found a tiny brain instead, and the ""Deveoping lungs"" were simply layers of fat. How do you explain living fossils that remained the same through millions of years? There is no single transnational fossil. I would like YOU to present evidence of their existence. Nobel prize winner Werner Arber 45 years of his life documenting the cumulative effects of mutations on thousands upon thousands of generations of single-cell organisms. He has found absolutely no mechanism that would enable a single-cell organism to evolve into a multi-cell organism. One common lie is that humans and chimps are 98.5% similar. If you look carefully, you will quickly notice something is off, Sibley and Ahlquist claimed that in 1987, but the human genome project finished in 2003. Sarich replicated the experiment and concluded that their research is completely unreliable. Is choosing to compare 30-40 amino acids from over 100000 amino acids look reliable to you? A nematode worm is 75% similar to humans, does this mean our bodies are similar to worms? Furthermore, a chicken's Y-chromosome is as close to humans as chimp's Y-chromosome. And if you want to point that the difference is 2 chromosomes, then know that potato have 46 chromosome like humans, so potato is our direct ancestor. Your singular argument is based on ""microevolution"", but a much more accurate term is ""variation"" or ""traits"". If you know basic Mendelian genetics, you would not preserve this as a proof of evolution. ""The central question of the Chicago conference was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapolated to explain the phenomena of macroevolution. …The answer can be given as a clear, No."" -R. Lewin, ""Evolutionary Theory Under Fire"", Science, vol. 210, 21 November, 1980, p. 883 Danny Faulkner, a professor of Astronomy and Physics at South Carolina University, states that the finch beaks' fluctuations cannot represent evidence of evolution: ""And so if you have supposed microevolution one direction and then later it reverts right back to where it started from, that's not evolution, it can't be."" -Gailon Totheroh, ""Evolution Outdated,"" 2001 ""the population, subjected to natural selection, is oscillating back and forth"" -Peter R. Grant, ""Natural Selection and Darwin's Finches,"" Scientific American, pp. 82-87 Microevolution have nothing to do with evolution since it is a closed circle that goes back and forth, theres no such thing as unlimited amount of traits, the amount is fixed and no new trait will emerge. I DARE you to prove me wrong. BTW, Darwin never conducted an experiment or even noticed their different beaks, nor did he discover the bird. So calling them Darwin's flinches is a myth.

That finch did not grow a longer beak for fun, it evolved because it NEEDED a longer beak in order to catch food.

S9e30175f-A4efcdf49	Evolution is a Real Thing	"ev·o·lu·tion: Change in the gene pool of a population from generation to generation by such processes asmutation, natural selection,and genetic drift. mi·cro·ev·o·lu·tion: Evolutionary change over a short period. mac·ro·ev·o·lu·tion: Major evolutionary change. The word evolution can mean either established fact, and to the theoretical model explaining observations in terms of what we know about that fact. Evolution, the fact, refers to the observed phenomenon of the changing of allele frequencies in populations. Evolution, the theory, refers to the theory that evolution (the fact) is a result of reproductive variation, and is mediated by differential reproductive success (natural selection) to produce new forms. Far to many people out there who haven't studied the ""theory of evolution"" simply says that evolution has happened. That's why creationists say ""It's just a theory"" and why people who accept evolution but don't really understand it say ""The theory of evolution has been proven!"" That's not what the theory of evolution says at all. To sort this mess out, we need to take a look at the scientific definitions of ""fact"" and ""theory"". So is evolution! We have observed evolution, both in the laboratory and in nature. Now some people who don't want evolution to be true will tell you that we haven't ever observed evolution, or that we've only seen microevolution (not macroevolution). These people are wrong. There's really no other way to say it. They want you to think that microevolution and macroevolution are somehow two different things, and that one can happen while the other can't. They don't want you to know that micro- and macroevolution are just two different ways of looking at the SAME THING. Beware creationist lies. A scientific theory is quite different from a fact. A theory doesn't say THAT something happens, but attempts to explain HOW something happens. For example, the theory of gravity doesn't say THAT gravity happens, but attempts to explain HOW gravity happens. The theory of evolution does not say THAT evolution happens - that much is accepted as fact by almost all scientists - but attempts to explain HOW evolution happens.To many people who haven't studied evolution, the ""theory of evolution"" simply says that evolution has happened. That's why creationists say ""It's just a theory"" and why people who accept evolution but don't really understand it say ""The theory of evolution has been proven!"" That's not what the theory of evolution says at all. To sort this mess out, we need to take a look at the scientific definitions of ""fact"" and ""theory"". In science, a fact is simply a data point; something that has been observed and catalogued. For example, you could say that gravity is a fact because when you let something go, you can observe it falling to the ground. If the object is acting under the influence of gravity alone, it falls to the ground every single time. The theory of evolution does not say THAT evolution happens - that much is accepted as fact by almost all scientists - but attempts to explain HOW evolution happens. Can a theory ever be proven? No. Unfortunately, many people think that the reality of evolution means the theory has been proven. That's not the case. The explanation about HOW evolution occurs can never be proven, just as NO SCIENTIFIC THEORY CAN BE PROVEN! You can accumulate evidence to support a particular theory, but there must always be the possibility of falsification. The theory of evolution could be falsified if we found some example of evolution that is not occurring in the way that we think it does. Again, even if the THEORY were falsified, that doesn't mean that evolution isn't happening. It just means we're back to the drawing board to figure out HOW."	PRO	840
Sdf849491-Ae873b433	Why GOD is real	"Here is how the Big Bang is often presented: Somewhere between 18 and 20 billion years ago, all of the matter in the universe was compressed into a tiny space no larger than the dot on a page. This dot spun faster and faster until it exploded, thus creating the Universe and everything in it. There are many problems with this theory. And the theory itself still does not answer many important questions - Such as where did all the matter in the universe come from? If all the matter in the universe was compressed into a small dot, what caused this to happen? Where did gravity come from that held it together? If this ""dot"" spun rapidly until it exploded., then where did the energy come from to start the spinning? Also, in an environment without friction you would have this spinning dot going so fast it would then explode. If this happened, then all of the particles and matter being expelled from this ""spinning dot"" would all have to spin in the same direction as the dot they exploded from. This is a known law of science, which those who believe in Evolution cannot do away with. It is known as the Conservation of angular momentum. This matter which is said to have created the planets would all need to spin in the same direction as the object it came from. So therefore, all of the planets should be spinning in the same direction. However two of them are not. Venus and Uranus spin backwards. The Big Bang theory also ignores the First law of Thermodynamics, which says: ""matter cannot be created or destroyed"" Those who believe in the Big Bang theory are also either unaware of, or ignore the ""Second Law of Thermodynamics"" which says: ""Everything tends towards disorder"" So rather than the chaos (big bang) becoming ordered (our universe), just the opposite would be true.. And it is. Our complex universe is wearing down, and becoming more chaotic... Paul was aware of this when he wrote his letter to the Hebrews: Everything "".. waxes old like a garment"" (quoted in both Psalm 102:25-27, and also Hebrews 1:10-12). ""This verse ""anticipates the famous second law of thermodynamics, or law of entropy, indicating that everything in the physical universe is growing old and wearing out. God created everything in the beginning, winding it up like a great clock, so to speak. Because of sin and the curse, however, it has been running down and ""perishing"" ever since. Jesus also said: ""Heaven and earth shall pass away"" (literally, ""are passing away"") (Matthew 24:35)"" - Waxing Old, like a Garment by Henry Morris, Ph.D. Newton to Einstein insisted that biblical religion provided the key ideas from which experimental science could develop. Since you like science so much. Yes the bible has been remade but that is because it was wrote in Hebrew and they was translating it. The story of Noah's ark is one of the most misunderstood in the Bible. 7 The Lord then said to Noah, ""Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. 2 Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, 3 and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. 4 Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."" Now the earth was corrupt in God""s sight and was full of violence. 12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 13 So God said to Noah, ""I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. Looks familiar? Look at all the violence happening all over the world today. 2014 was a catastrophic year for millions caught up in violence. Jude 1:4 ...'For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.' everywhere today. Yes this country was basically built on God. ""In God we Trust"". God is being took out of everything just about, and the more we take it out the more this country goes downhill. Luke 19:40King James Version (KJV) 40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

Sdf849491-Ac9ed5340	Why GOD is real	"So thank you for not citing your source for that giant quote. I'll do it for you (http://www.angelfire.com...) All of these points that you brought up are easily disputed. Venus and Uranus, for example, most probably spin in the other direction because a large asteroid ran into them and the force of it caused them to spin the other way. The energy from this 'spinning dot' came from all of the matter being condensed like a black hole. The first law of thermodynamics ""Matter cannot be created or destroyed"" does not apply to the Big Bang Theory, but rather to the Creation myths. God happened out of nowhere, and made the universe with the snap of his fingers. The Big Bang Theory proposes that, though the name is quite misleading, that it was neither ""big"" nor a ""bang."" It started out with every piece of matter mashed together, and spread out over time (http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com...) which leads experts to believe that the law of thermodynamics does not necessarily apply to the 'creation' of the universe. The world is not becoming more chaotic. Everyday we are taking strides to make our lives easier, helping developing nations grow, organizing our own lives. Slowly but surely, we are coming to understand the world and universe around us. Newton and Einstein, as inspirational geniuses they were, could not possibly know everything. The technology was simply not as reliable in their times as it is today. Gravity was only just becoming understood in Newton's time, the atomic bomb has been improved on ten fold since Einstein's time; Not every single theory they made back then is still going to be relevant today. Just as how it was the norm to believe the Earth was flat or the center of the universe, the Big Bang theory will evolve and expand until it is perfected. ""In God We Trust"" only became the nation's motto in 1956, 180 years after our country signed the Declaration of Independence. (https://www.usmint.gov...) It would not be fair or accurate to claim that because of this our nation was ""built on God"" as you suggest. Noah's Ark is not the first flood story. These are common throughout history, and the Bible was not the first one to use it. Egypt, Babylonia, Native Americans, and more had similar myths. Each had their own little twists, but they all share a common theme. To believe that one of these are true, such as Noah's Ark, than shouldn't the rest be true as well, especially when they came hundreds or even thousands of years before the Bible was written? To be honest I'm not sure how rock slides have anything to do with proving God exists because it is a natural occurrence that has been happening ever since there was rocks. In conclusion, common arguments that people use to defend the existence of God and Christ are illogical. They go against everything we have observed about the universe, and continue to observe today. Religion is a fall back for people, because it is traditional. Their parents and grandparents went to church, so it seems natural to devote every Sunday of the year to worshipping God. Unfortunately this is a waste of time, because God does not exist, and will not be able to listen to your prayers. Thank you for your time. It was a pleasure debating with you."	CON	842

The moisture, surface geometry and the location the food item was dropped on did, however, affect the number of bacteria.' Wheredas Tim Allen put this to the test 'and found that bacteria will cling to food immediately. High traffic areas will lead to even more bacteria on the food.'. In folklore, 'the states that food dropped on the ground will not be significantly contaminated with bacteria if it is picked up within five seconds of being dropped. Some may earnestly believe this assertion, whereas other people employ the rule as a polite social fiction that will allow them to still eat a lightly contaminated piece of food, despite the potential reservations of their peers. There are many variations on the rule. Sometimes the time limit is modified. In some variations, the person picking up the food arbitrarily extends the time limit based on the actual amount of time required to retrieve the food.'

They believe this because in Antarctica there is a giant wall made of ice that world widely agreed not to be explored. This is how they hide it. Now onto your next point, ""How does flat earth explain eclipses?"" That I know of there is only two theories concerning this part. One is of course that just because the Earth is flat does not necessarily mean that there's no space. Some also believe that the sun just goes around the edge of the flat Earth, instead of straight over. Now this belief is a bit more complicated. Many flat Earhters believe that the is also no such thing as space, instead there is a firmament. This is a structure above the Earth's atmosphere that looks like a vast solid dome. Above the dome is water. Now, you say that you are a Christian, so you should know of this. After all, the firmament is in Genesis since ""God created the firmament to separate the water above from the waters below."" Now you also say round Earth is widely accepted by multiple religions.

Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."" Does darkness exist? Darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."" Does evil exist? Evil does not exist, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil.

His Cogito does logically proof the individuals existence. However you overlook the fact that the Cogito does not ""prove"" we exist as physical beings nor does it prove that other intelligences exist. They could all be a dream. This was pointed out by subsequent philosopher whose name it seems everyone has forgotten, with his ""side-bar"" to the Cogito saying ""I dream therefore I exist."" You seem to overlook the fact that both of these philosophers are agreeing with my side of the debate rather than yours. Both speculate out that a being can exist as an ""intelligence"" or as a ""dream"" without having physical form at all and yet be more than just an idea. You are correct as well in pointing out the flaw in deductive reasoning, just as whoever the philosopher was pointed out the error in the Cogito. However the very point of the Cogito was the fact they you cannot prove that you are typing an looking at a computer screen. You cannot even prove your existence to me as I may be having a dream that I am debating with you. You can only prove you exist as an intelligence to yourself. Nothing more. Descartes went on to bring God existence into the issue because the fact that God would not deceive us was the only way he could accept the physical reality. I want to point out that virtually every invention of man was as a result of deductive reasoning. To rule out rational metaphysics and that truth can be discovered by reason is to rule out all deductive reasoning and philosophy as well. You are still overlooking everything I said about subjectivity. Yes! What if we cant prove this, what if we cant prove that. That's when we must act on impassion and emotion to answer the question. I believe we are using subjectivity to give us the validity that you are there, we are debating etc. If we cannot prove anything, we must be subjective about it. I'm not saying I do not believe in intelligent design, I'm saying I do not believe in intelligent design by god because both you and I know all the inconsistencies that have been covered in every other god debate. However the very point of the Cogito was the fact thay you cannot prove that you are typing an looking at a computer screen. You cannot even prove your existence to me as I may be having a dream that I am debating with you. You can only prove you exist as an intelligence to yourself. Nothing more. This is a very important point. But if I don't exist, why or how are you debating me? The thing is you're still debating me, therefore I still retain value in your mind, so I exist as a subjective idea. I've come to the realization the true meaning of this debate is not regarding metaphysics. It simply comes down to this: We cannot prove god rationally, because god has no OBJECTIVITY. The truth about god can only be answered with SUBJECTIVITY. EVERTHING IS SUBJECTIVE. You miss my point concerning love and hate. As I pointed out I am not talking about an emotion or saying ""I love/hate you."" Nor am I talking about the chemical reactions in our bodies that produce hormonal attraction. And please note that your link is mere fluffy hearsay because it contains no link to the supposed actual research of the supposed ""scientists"". Even the article credited to an on-line writer (""according to...""). To say that to show pictures and obtain a chemical reaction does not therefore definetrue love as a chemical reaction. There is a love that goes far, far deeper. An abiding presence. A love of God, a love of mankind... not just a desire to help those less fortunate but seeing everyone as a true brother or sister. True love exists, but it is not found in any chemicals. I admit that article was pretty bad. But this whole paragraph shows a lot of unneeded humanism. Let me ask you a question, ""Why should we love mankind if this may all be a dream and they mean nothing?"" You're just contradicting yourself. This ""deep"" love you speak of, I've never felt it, so how does it exist? The evidence you are simply providing only affects you and not me. It's like when somebody says "" Oh yes, I always feel that god is with me everywhere I go."" That's you, not me. I think you nailed your coffin tight with the remark ""I can choose to disbelieve in them subjectively"". Is reality up to what you say reality is? Can there exist a definitive truth even though you or I do not know what that truth is? TRUTH IS SUBJECTIVE, which makes it definitive to you or I. You cannot determine if my definition of reality is reality, so you are forced to draw conclusions SUBJECTIVELY. As I have pointed out things can be deduced by rational thought. Yes, this is partly true. I'm not saying that rationality cannot deduce anything, this would be absurd. But Rationality is limited when it comes to the god debate, due to the fact that there is no objectivity. What I'm saying is Science and rationality have no consideration for ultimate purposes. Nietzsche said this in ""Human, All Too Human."" The fact that we have an ""idea"" in no way shape or form means that our idea exists ONLY as an idea. Logic takes us from the known to the unknown. It is this very idea that scientists have been able to seriously speculate about other dimensions even there is no way of possibly proving it. Very good point. Every invention does start as an idea does it not? The inventors want this idea to exist, so they make it exist. THIS IS SUBJECTIVE, and the same could be said about god. Again, god can be proved subjectively, not rationally. I can understand if they had programmed us to be peaceful to THEM. I agree with this. But if they themselves had no notion of God why would they program others to believe in Him? Sorry, but I do not see the sense in that. As you said before the possibilities are endless. I personally think they would do it for the sake of maintaining a basic sense of control and organization. Finally as I pointed out that because you or have an idea certainly does not make that idea correct. Nor does it make it incorrect. What we think exists may in fact exist in reality, even if not physically. FOR THE 40TH TIME, THIS MUST FORCE US TO THINK SUBJECTIVELY. If as those scientists and other have said that the ""supernatural"" does exist then all they have done is increased the likelihood of God existing supernaturally. Like you said in the previous sentence, ideas could be incorrect. The real truth is subjective, not objective."	PRO	867
Se8b34212-Ada221a6a	God, heaven, and hell only exist metaphysically, not physically. Therefore, are only ideas.	"Rebuttals. ""Rational"" metaphysics, I'll get to that. ""Physical"" is something that can bee seen and touched. Certainly neither God nor heaven are ""physical"", at least in any sense we know. But first off how do you know that the physical actually exists at all? Edgar Allan Poe wrote: ""All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream."" While I certainly do not consider him an expert in the field I do not rule out that what he said is true. Science tells us that there is nothing ""physical"" about the atoms which make up everything. When magnified to its maximum the only thing that makes up a nucleus of an atom is a tiny ribbon of energy. This is a good point. You seem to be asking,""How can we even perceive reality?"" To answer this question, I feel that it is fundamental to understand how we perceive existence. Descartes famously said ""Cogito ergo sum"", or ""I think, therefore I am.""(http://en.wikipedia.org...) He proved this with an example. Let's imagine that there is an invisible evil genius is filling our minds with incorrect idea's to keep us for understanding the truth. It's childish, but can you prove it's not true? Descartes figured out that If the evil genius was fooling him, he'd have to exist in order for him to do just that. If we doubt our own existence, we must exist in order to doubt it. So now that we know about existence, lets talk about reality. Or more importantly, rationality. The reason I try to stay away from rational metaphysics is because it is simply flawed at times. If I think rationally about Descartes' s findings I would ask myself, ""Could his findings just be another incorrect idea of the evil genius?"" We can answer this, not with rationality, but with subjectivity. This is the point where faith and emotion must come into play, because there is no factual evidence or something that is observed to support the existence of god. Therefore, you cannot prove it rationally. I'm pretty sure there was even experiments done that proved quantum mechanics. But not god. It's nearly instinctive for humans to decide subjectively when they don't know. This is the case of reality. I am here. I am typing. I am looking at the computer screen. These are all subjective statements. By acting on these subjective thoughts, I give them validity, therefore meaning to me and my life. One could even argue that the past doesn't exist. Likewise your argument ignores the fact that certain things certainly DO exist that are far more than ""ideas"". I would place God in that category. But in it also are love, hate and a host of other things that transcend mere ""emotional"" response and can exist in reality. True love, not just the hormonal sense of attraction, undoubtedly does exist but is neither ""physical"" nor merely an ""idea"". If that is true of love why can it not be true also of God? These could all be considered ideas.""I love you."" ""I hate you."" Theoretically, you're proposing an subjective idea about how you feel about somebody. I understand what you're saying, but you're still proposing ideas. Even with love, there is something being observed, so it can be ruled out rationally. Plus I found this article about how true love was observed as a chemical reaction (http://jezebel.com...) God is essentially just an idea that more than 1 person believes in. This makes it a subjectively stronger idea, yet an idea nonetheless. Many scientists, even agnostics and atheists, have acknowledged the possibility of the ""supernatural"" and that an ""intelligence"" was behind the existence of our universe and ourselves. Atheist Stephen Hawking said: ""The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron "". The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been finely adjusted to make possible the development of life."" Agnostic astrophysicist and NASA scientist Robert Jastrow said: ""Astronomers now find they have painted themselves into a corner because they have proved, by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And they have found that all this happened as a product of forces they cannot hope to discover. That there are what I or anyone would call supernatural forces at work is now, I think, a scientifically proven fact."" More recently, two papers published last year also seem to indicate that. The first was in March in the premier scientific journal ""Icarus"" which essentially said that an intelligence WAS responsible for the programming of our DNA.http://www.evolutionnews.org...... (note: while the link is to a source that certainly could be called ""biased"", the journal where it appeared certainly is not. Here is an abstract: http://www.sciencedirect.com...... ). What that says about evolution I will leave, but it is obviously profound. But the fact is that it leaves us with only two logical choices: either the programming was done by an alien life form from within our universe or that it was a supernatural intelligence. The second paper was published in May as a result of a three year study in 20 countries done by Oxford University. It found that human beings are PREdisposed to believe in God and in an afterlife. http://www.ox.ac.uk...... History and Archeology have proved that every culture everywhere no matter how primitive or isolated have sought God in their own way. This has been shown to be true even of proto-humans. The fact that this was true from the beginning of mankind indicates that it is not a ""learned behavior"" for survival, but rather programmed into our DNA. As a result when you link this with the previous study of the two possible choices, an alien or supernatural intelligence, the one that seems most likely is the supernatural, for why would an alien culture program us to believe in God? All of these articles provide solid findings. But I can choose to disbelieve in them subjectively. I haven't seen the real proof with my own eyes, therefore it may not exist. Overall, I do not believe that this is a debate about evolution or science. The debate is rooted in religion and philosophy. Plus I could think of a BILLION ways for aliens to program us to believe in god. Finally, absolutely everything can be considered an idea. I apologize if my grammar or spelling is rough, it's 3 am here."	PRO	868

Sdaae345e-A8233fb53	"None of these debates are ""real debates"", just self-appointed guffaws without sense of self-discipli"	"I'm not sure if pro is a troll or insane Semantics and The Resolution: Pro lists the rules as follows:""There is no such thing as BOP, Source, Resolution, Tautology or Answer in a debate that involves a truly intelligent specimen that treats knowledge more than a toy or tool to prove one's self."" Now this is either trying to bridge the gap because pro is aware of his poor debating skills or he does not know what a debate is. A debate is defined as follows:""a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints"". A resolution is what's being debated, if there's no resolution, there is no debate. A BoP is extremely vital to any intellectual discussion. "" In statistical inference of observed data of a scientific experiment, the null hypothesis refers to a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena "" If there is no BoP or Noll Hypothesis, then one will end up believing mutually contradictory claims. Sources are important, because it let's one know that a participant is not pulling data out of thin air. Plus the chances are that in most debates on this site, neither participant has a PhD in the subject, so sources get the viewpoint of someone with authority. The Resolution is that none of the debates pro listed are real debates. Well per the definition of debate, if ANY of the debates mentioned in pro's first round, involve a public question, with two opposing view points, the resolution is negated. Let's take the debate: "" Gods; ghosts; aliens; other creatures that only exist in our heads "" One can either be Pro or Con for god's existence, or the existence of ghosts or aliens. By definition this is a ""real debate"". Now if it's a meaningful debate is a differen't subject. Also the proposition that X is X but not a real X is incoherent. How can something be a debate but not a real debate? By law of identity X is X. By law of non-contradiction X can't be true and false. By law of excluded middle, either X is true or X is false. So a debate is necessarily a real debate, if it is a debate. So basically I win, pro literally can not meet the BoP. On Pro Being A Jerk: Pro's reasoning is as follows: ""same back and forth issues; same sources; same misunderstanding; same suspecting; same question begging; same ignorance; same typical case of a human being that does not spend at least an hour to think to themselves in a dark room, but comes onto a matrix of information, built by intelligence, to spread their ignorance just because they want to argue with another primate."" Well he has offered no justification for these assertions. ""Same sources"" ? Obviously not, if they were the same sources, everyone would have the same position. ""Same misunderstanding""? No, then everyone would be on the same side, but incorrect. ""Same question begging?""

Example: Bill: ""God must exist."" Jill: ""How do you know."" Bill: ""Because the Bible says so."" Jill: ""Why should I believe the Bible?"" Bill: ""Because the Bible was written by God."" BoP is on Pro to show that all of these beg the question. ""Same ignorance""? Once again, everyone would have the same position. Also,you have not justified that it is ignorance.

First of all, the page my opponent links to was written in 1998."" My opponent needs to explain himself better. I have no idea why its bad and he has no source to support him. Instead, he has a source to attack the owners of the organization, but that does not refute the data given and the fact that most proponents of global warming have no decent refutation themselves. This means refutation here holds. In fact, one could say that this idea that ""big oil is making lies"" is completely a myth. The main proponent that this corruption exists is environmental journalist Ross Gelbspan who accused the these companies lying about global warming: ""This is the only accusation there is, and it spirals back in each case to one source. Ross Gelbspan. Nobody else independently confirms or corroborates it, they just repeat it. Endlessly. And just like Gelbspan and Gore, not a shred of physical evidence is shown to prove money was given in exchange for demonstratively false fabricated science assessments. If multiple easily found problems with the ‘skeptic scientists receive corrupt fossil fuel industry funding’ narrative give a clear indication of how the whole accusation is in danger of total collapse, then we have a major problem with the long-held idea that there is no credible science-based opposition to the idea of man-caused global warming.""

Sf48c7376-Adcc31c95	Global warming is real	"The first problem with my opponent's response is his failure to address one big concern, which is that the only piece of evidence he has referenced was written in 1998. In the intervening 15 years, not only has scientific consensus moved even more towards acceptance of anthropogenic cglobal warming, but climate and weather patterns have more starkly revealed the ongoing changes. Temperatures have been increasing more rapidly even just over the past 5 or so years, as record heat waves would suggest. This calls into question his authors' outdated assumption that increases in temperature have caused or are simply correlated with levels of carbon dioxide. I did a Google search for ""hottest years global warming."" The three first results were: http://www.guardian.co.uk... http://www.slate.com... http://www.nytimes.com... All of these respected sources verify that the earth is warming. Of the first 12 relevant results, 11 supported the idea that the earth is growing warmer. It also indicates that NOAA and NASA scientists, whose motivations are far less questionable than scientists who admit they receive funding from oil companies, say that this is independent, empirical verification of a conclusion they had already reached based on modeling theories. Additionally, the ten hottest years since 1880 were all after 1998-the year in which my opponent's only evidence was written. The claim that Ross Gelbspan is the only one accusing the companies of lying is a semantic trick. My implication wasn't that the Idso family is lying, however they have ideological and financial biases here, which is why you should be skeptical of their work given that they are joined by less than 3% of the scientific community. My opponent seems to accuse me of not having sufficient data. Here's another source that explains the study I linked to in the last round: http://www.slate.com... This article also states that most of the people who disagree are not actually climatologists. You should prefer a consensus of people qualified to be writing on the topic. Additionally, it documents some of the relevant information. Carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in 3 million years, which is contributing to the fastest rate of warming in at least 11,000 years. This is no coincidence; only massive human pollution has the potential to create these changes in such a brief timeframe. Here is another method that was used to validate different measurements of temperatures: http://www.scientificamerican.com... Finally, my opponent is far too dismissive of the paper I linked to in the last round. He says the consensus is ""a bunch of people who have not looked too deeply into the issue or their (sic) liars and frauds."" He says this after accusing me of not providing a reason as to why his authors are biased. The scientists he cites clearly have a vested interest in the matter. He has not provided a reason why my authors must be liars or frauds. In fact, he is actually making the accusation that the meta-analysis I cited, which reviewed 1,000s of papers written on the subject by scientists who have devoted their careers to this field (including many employed by agencies of the government) is invalid, and that you should prefer one family of scientists over these data. He is making the claim that two people are more trustworthy because 97% of the scientific community are frauds or liars. I ask the voters, what is more likely? That two people linked to oil companies are biased/simply mistaken and outdated, or that almost every climate scientist on earth is engaged in a conspiracy? I think it's clear that my opponent's position is absurd."	PRO	881

My opponent then said he Google searched the hottest years and global warming and put up the three first results, but he does not explain much. It looks far too recent and we must look and longer historical trends. In fact, climate change has occured all through the history of the Earth. It will continue like this and it has both been very warm before and very cold. It has been quite warm at the moment, but a cooling trend is expected.

Only a small amount of economists predicted the Great Depression. Also, this ""consensus"" thing is more of a myth than a reality. As said here: ""It is a strange claim to make. Consensus or near-consensus is not a scientific argument. Indeed, the heroes in the history of science are those who challenged the prevailing consensus and convincingly demonstrated that everyone thought wrong. Such heroes are even better appreciated if they take on not only the scientific establishment but the worldly and godly authorities as well.""

Those who propose CO2 as a cause of global warming have failed to decide what came first. It is clear that the rise in temperature caused it as the Center for Study of Carbon Dioxide says and thus global warming is not likely man-made.

S6d66188-A8651985	where are the real republicans	To say the republican party is no more racist than the dems is unbelievable. the dems as i stated before are the primary ones always fighting for segregation and it pretty much still stands today among that party. Now you have made some understandable points that hold true to the republican party today but you understand and know that that is not what the republicans truly stand for. Who would dare try to say Pres George Bush is a republican! A true republican is a group of people who let the down trodden work out the problems with letting them think that government is there to help them out. They give a hand up not a hand out. They believe in getting up in the morning and busting but to accomplish a goal of success in life. Being economically smart not wating on the unemployment check. You cannot today tell the difference between dems and repubs because they both believe that government is the way out that is just dumb. How many times do you have to pass legislation to build a fence. You say basically we should have open boarders? may i remind you of how rome really fell? because they had let cheap and next to nothing labor come in and build and create everything while they sat on there rear and got fat. When it came time to defend what was theres they couldn't because they had basically forgotten how. I know that is not a great description but it holds basically true. You also say that immigration is not a federal issue! It I believe is and should be it involves this whole country no matter what boarder. I do argue that education is a federal issue and also that is what is wrong with it. Health care a federal issue? are you kidding? that is just ignorant You ask do I make the party platform? Do I control the republican politicians? I answer these questions with a big no but that in itself is the problem. We as the people should make the platform for what we believe in as republicans.

S6d66188-A5e9d10de	where are the real republicans	"You continue to attempt to bait me into debates which are not within the spectrum of the question. If you want to debate immigration policy, education, healthcare, and the lack of democracy in the creation of Party platforms, I would be happy to - in different debates. The question at hand is whether the current Republicans are true to what Republicans should be, in reference to their history. That is the topic I will stay on. That said, I do not think you have looked deeply enough into the issues of racism I have pointed to. The issue with immigration has a serious racial undercurrent, whether you want to admit it or not. Again, the current legal paths to immigration are favorable to those living in a well-developed area (Europe) or those who are fairly well-off (mostly Europeans). It takes so long that those in a fairly good position are much more able to wait than those in areas like Africa, Asia, and Latin America where the issue is horrible poverty and they need opportunities sooner rather than later. Furthermore, when speaking on illegal immigration, they always talk tough on border security (where Mexicans are the vast majority of illegals), whereas overstays on visas (which make up about half of all illegal immigration [1]) is basically ignored. The Republicans also have a position on trade which often takes a sometimes-racist, always-nationalist tone. The Republicans worry most on the cheap labor in Mexico and Asia, but have no objections to jobs moving inside the country (generally to whites). Their feelings on foreign oil are very clearly racist - the Middle Easterners are not to be trusted, but mum's the word on the Canadian oil we receive. Not to mention the Republicans' support for the War on Drugs, which is obscenely racist. The difference between the punishment for crack cocaine and powder cocaine is case-in-point. The disparity is 100 to 1, as the punishment for five grams of crack is equal to that of five hundred grams of powder. Blacks are by and large those who use crack, and while recently Hispanics have become the largest users of powder cocaine, originally it was most prevalent among whites. Crack sentences are also on average 43.5% longer than those of powder (121.5 months and 84.7 months, respectively) [2]. As for the Republicans supporting self-reliance, that hasn't been true since the days of Robert Taft and Barry Goldwater. Modern Republicans, almost all of them, are supportive of the New Deal programs and even the Great Society programs. Look at Mitt Romney - he is actually left of Obama on the issue of healthcare (while Obama will provide insurance for any who can't afford it and wants it, he will not force anyone to buy insurance like Romney proposes to do to everyone). Besides Ron Paul, none of the Republicans are talking about actually ending welfare, Social Security, and Medicaid/Medicare. They all just want to run them ""more efficiently"" - that is, their bureaucrats instead of the Democrats' bureaucrats. The Republicans may oppose increasing the minimum wage (sometimes), they certainly aren't talking about ending it. When McCain came to the town I live in, he actually proposed a guaranteed minimum income scheme and increasing unemployment insurance. The Republicans, as I stated earlier, have increased the size of the Department of Education significantly and none dare suggest that education should be privatized. The Republicans are for big government at home too - don't be fooled by rhetoric. And, again, this fits well with the Lincoln Republicans who were very much in favor of bigger government. 1 - http://www.csmonitor.com... 2 - http://www.usnews.com..."	CON	885

S33b32f5f-Ac00938fe	Is God real and is the Bible accurate	I would like to tell you that the Bible does have mistakes. But these mistake are not great and by this I mean that there are few spelling errors and animal mix ups because of the large number of translations. But as supported by the Dead Sea Scrolls this remains true in the way the only simple spelling mistake and animal mix ups are present. And as far as the snake shall crawl on its belly and EAT dust you have to think of it not so direct. What I mean by this is that when the serpent was to eat dust the Bible doesn't mean actually eat it what it is saying is that the serpent is level with it ,that other animals are blessed with legs to keep them off the ground (off of the dust). These so called problems with the Bible are not problems they have a more in depth meaning than what we may see and a glance. It's similar to reading a Shakespeare play now even though it makes complete sense at the time and even now if you think about it and don't just glance. Back to the how did organisms come from nonliving things this is reasoning question that has been thought about by every person for thousands of years and many many people have come to the same conclusion and this conclusion points to a god or entirety...God. And fast forward to about 2000 years ago. When Jesus was on the Earth. Scientifically Jesus of Nazareth was on Earth and but the only thing is whether people think of him as more. He did things that were incredible things that turned people away from there very strong belief in God (Judaism) I mean if people didn't actually see Jesus of Nazareth do these amazing miracle's why would they turn away from there very strong belief. The Bible does not support rape, murder stealing or anything of that nature. It is very against it. why don't you instead of looking it online because things can be changed ONLINE look in an actually copy of the Bible to get your answers then do some cross checking online to clarify. You see like I said there is a deeper meaning to the words in the Bible. I mean come on people of all types of intelligence even the genius of human kind all point that God and the Bible are true. Of course you will have some modern intelligent people going against it but the reason for this I believe is false information and lack of complex reasoning skills. I once did not believe that the Bible was true ,but I searched for information EVERYWHERE and bias and unbiased information and I found that the Bible makes complete sense and even using scientific evidence and reasoning it makes sense and this is why it is true and this is why it has withstood attacks for the past thousands of years.

If God exists, God: (a) wants all humans to believe God exists before they die; (b) can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die; (c) does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and (d) always acts in accordance with what it most wants. 2. If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die. (From 1) 3. But not all humans believe God exists before they die. .: Therefore, God does not exist. (From 2 and 3) In response to the second premise of the syllogism, my opponent argues that not all humans could logically be expected to believe in God under theistic assumptions because they have free will. In response to this, I will simply reiterate what I said in a previous debate on this subject. The second premise of the syllogism has nothing to do with free will or its negation. If God exists and wants all humans to believe this before they die, then he could appear before the world in order to demonstrate his existence. According to the Bible itself, God did this with Moses on Mt. Sinai and he also revealed himself to other people through Jesus. So, even from a biblical perspective, God could bring about a situation whereby everyone believed in him without compromising their free will. ::Conclusion:: I feel no compunction at stopping here.

Se8932a5a-A64834d9d	we need to teach kids more real world topics	"I am looking forward to it. Also, please forgive my awkward English, this is not my first language. If I understand Pro rightly, her thesis is ""School ought to teach about how to deal with situations that arise in a citizen's everyday life."" Pro cites as examples how to obtain and maintain a mortgage and how to manage taxes and bills. One has to think about the role of school versus the role of parents in the education of children. Who is supposed to do what? One can answer this question by asking oneself: who is to blame if a child displays a gap? For instance, people will usually blame the parents, not the school, for a child's rude behavior. On the contrary, people will blame school for a child's illiteracy. With this in mind, I ask the question: if somebody doesn't know how to fill one's tax declaration, who is to blame? The school? The parents? I believe neither are. It is the person herself who is to blame. Similarly to the animal who, leaving its parents, will have to display autonomy in order to survive, a person must display autonomy in her citizen's life. If one encounters a novel situation, such as a first mortgage to be signed, it is one's own responsibility to inform oneself of how to respond to this situation. The responsibility lies on the citizen herself for at least two reasons. First, because the first-time cases one will encounter are innumerable. Pro cites mortgage and taxes as examples, but one can think of entering into a marriage, opening a bank account, signing rental agreements, buying real estate, buying a car, going to vote, creating a will, creating a business"" Rather than teaching how to deal with each of these situations, it is more efficient to teach to be autonomous and to seek the information relevant to these situations. And while autonomy is expected to be learnt by oneself, as animals themselves are not taught to be autonomous, but learn to be so from experience, if it is to be taught, using the above question ""who is to blame?"", one would readily answer ""the parents"" if an individual would display a lack of autonomy. Second, because of this diversity of first-time cases, schools would have to spend a great deal of time teaching how to react in each case, at the expense of topics one would need in one's professional life. Besides, citizens do not encounter the same first-time situations: some will move abroad and need to establish residence in an alien country, and will need to know the local legislation; others will never enter into marriage and will not need to know the related administrative procedures. Thus, taking up the argument of my opponent, school would be led to teach topics that will prove useless for some of its students. Lastly, even if school was responsible in teaching how to react in situations that arise in a citizen's life, such situations would be disconnected from the student's life at the time of the teaching. It is unlikely that a high-school student understands the burden of a mortgage or that of buying real estate, and so she will not be interested in learning how to deal with these situations. Moreover, these situations would arise long after the student has been taught about them, so that, facing a contract to be signed, the citizen will certainly have forgotten what she was taught about this contract some ten or twenty years ago.

S9a809f39-Af0c58862	The Christian God is Real	"Thank you Pro, for joining the debate. I concede that you are right, I can not disprove a God""s existence, because I have a negative stance on the subject. Indeed, in order for rational arguments and theories to be proven correct, the positive claim must provide sufficient evidence to back up the claim. The negative, which is that one may not believe what is being said because of a lack of evidence, has no burden of proof, and has the sole responsibility of analyzing the proof available. For example: if a man were to tell another man that he does not believe McDonald's exists, then it is up to the second man, who says it does exist, to provide evidence that confirms the positive claim. The negative (skepticism) is a default position, and thus has no burden of proof because it is making no claim besides disbelief. I do not need to provide reasons for not believing in a tooth fairy or Bigfoot, because the other is the one with the positive claim. Also, I may not say that I am 100% sure that a God does not exist, but as said before, the evidence is so scarce that I may be 99.9% sure that he indeed does not, which is the probability I hold with respect to Zeus, Thor, Bigfoot, or leprechauns. On the fine-tuning of the universe, I must disagree and say that we do not know that there could be a better situation for the universe to be in. We have only this universe, and cannot compare it to others to say that this one is the best possible universe. If the claim, however, is that humans are perfectly suited for life here, I must also disagree and say that humans have no appearance of having been created to live in this universe. Our existence is not perfect, we cannot live in space, water, fire, extreme temperatures (too hot, too cold), we are subject to deaths by disease, other animals, hunger and thirst. Indeed, we can only live in a small fraction of the world, and an even smaller fraction of the universe. If, for example, gravity changed a little bit on this planet, there is no reason to believe that life could not exist, but it would surely be different to the one we know. As of the origin and complexity of life, we need only to look at evolution, which explains how simple organisms evolved into more complex forms of life through natural selection and multiple other events and processes including extinctions, mutations, climate change, etc. (Carl Zimmer""s ""Evolution, The Triumph of an Idea"") As to the origin of life itself, little is know, but there have been experiments such as the Miller-Urey experiment, which provided evidence that the basic building blocks of life can originate from nonliving matter. (Carl Sagan""s ""Cosmos"") Even if, however, this experiment had failed to prove it""s goal, it is still not proof that links directly to God""s existence, as this claim has still not met its burden of proof, and is not a usable alternative. As to the resurrection of Jesus, no evidence is presented that such an event ever happened. No witnesses were present that we know of, as all the supposed ones are nameless and even the gospels are anonymous. Even if this had happened, it is still not proof that he was the son of God. We know from recent cases that the human body may appear to be dead because of certain conditions, and apparently become ""resurrected"" after being supposedly dead. http://www.bbc.com... A case like this may well have been the case with Jesus, because he was not the only person to supposedly have risen from the dead. (Dionysus, Osiris and Ganesha are also examples of alleged resurrections.) Finally, morality within man is not surprising. We all have a certain instinct that tells us that we are doing something wrong, and I affirm this is a result of evolution as well. We prefer to save members of our kind, because we have evolved to ensure our species"" survival. We can also know what is good and bad because of the consequences such actions have on human well-being. Once we became fit enough to survive more easily in the world, we could come up with more complex forms of morality which have evolved with us since we had the ability to think. This is a more plausible explanation to morality in my view, than claiming an unproved supernatural being gave it to us. I thank Con for his arguments and await his response, recommending that we try to keep as little arguments as possible in order to save time and space, and so as not to bore our readers."	CON	894
S9a809f39-A5f91c06e	The Christian God is Real	"I thank Con for his response. We do know who the gospel writers were, who Paul was, who Peter was, and all of the other New Testament writers (besides Hebrews). Con, in saying that ""We don""t know!"" has stated a common misconception that someone who has not dug deep into history could make. We have so much evidence; it is just that Pro is not willing to look. We have evidence of Jesus from Tacticus, Pliny the Younger, Josephus, the Babylonian Talmud, and Lucian (http://www.bethinking.org...). These are hard evidence of the existence of Jesus. Now, it is just a preposterous way of thinking that the gospels were written by random anonymous persons. First of all, Con provides absolutely no evidence to disprove who the gospel writers are; only that ""they might have been written by someone else"". We also have evidence from the early church fathers Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and Eusebius, who all name Matthew as the author of the gospel attributed to him. For Mark, evidence comes from Papias, who said,""Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in the exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterward, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could."" This can be found in the writings of Papias. Luke's authorship also is supported by Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Gregory, Nazianze, and Jerome. John's authorship is supported by Irenaeus and Polycarp (according to Eusebius). http://radicaltruth.net... Matthew and John were eyewitnesses and disciples of Jesus and had written down their memoirs about the life and resurrection. Mark and Luke collected information from others and STILL ended up with a very similar story about Jesus' life, even though they had not witnessed it. Jesus could not have tried to fulfill the old prophecies, over 300 of them, all by himself. Some were out of his control, like how his clothes would be divided up and that he would be pierced in the side. It is literally impossible for Jesus to try and fulfill all of these prophecies. http://www.accordingtothescriptures.org... ""The notion that animals cannot love or have other feelings is preposterous"". This idea is the one that is preposterous. Animals have only the instinct to do something. If I give a dog something to eat, on instinct it would mark me as a potential food giver and give to me what is conceived as ""love."" God gave animals the instinct to protect their young; how would they reproduce of they didn't? But this is just but an instinct and cannot be expressed like the love in between humans. I will say one last thing about the fine-tuning of life; as of now, there is absolutely no way of proving that life can arise without energy and the perfect amount of other physical constants. This is a mere speculation with absolutely no evidence supporting it. From our perspective, we know that life can only happen with the perfect physical constants or we would never be here today. This is the most logical way of thinking that believing just a mere assertion without any evidence. This is all I have to say. The resurrection of Jesus is written by reliable, non-anonymous people. The fine-tuning argument t shows that life could have only commenced with certain requirements, and those requirements were met on Earth. The origin of life points to God because something cannot come out of nothing. Morality in man could not possibly be made by evolution; the fact that humans contemplate about God means that God had implanted the thought into our minds. Now, I probably did not win the arguments for all of these points, but that is for you, the voter or reader, to decide. I thank my opponent and all of the readers for joining me to this debate. I wish all of you a good day, and this is all for me."	PRO	895
S9a809f39-A9490d43d	The Christian God is Real	"Thank you for your response. We will be trying to prove these four points true or false. I will first present my case about what the fine-tuning of the universe is. Scientists these days have been stunned by the discovery of exactly how complex and sensitive a balance of initial conditions must be in order for the universe to permit the origin and evolution of life. If any balance of physical constants and quantities were disrupted by the slightest of margins, balance would be destroyed and life would not exist. For example, a change in the gravitational force or the electromagnetic force by only one part in 10^40 would have not permitted the existence of stars (including our sun), making life impossible. There are many others. This is not all there is to fine-tuning. The ratios in between two constants must be also finely tuned.The probability of a life-giving universe is so minutely small that it is almost impossible for all of this to have happened by chance. Some might say,""Well, there has to have been some universe to have done this. It's like winning the lottery. Someone has to win it."" But this argument is flawed. This is an analogy of why this is impossible. There are trillions and trillions of black balls in a box, and one white ball. You reach in and pick up the white ball. You do this a couple dozen times and pick the white ball every time. You have now made a live-permitting universe! Now you can see how this is basically impossible, unless you have an infinite amount of universes. I will not go on with refuting the infinite-universe unless Con decides to challenge it in another round. The origin of life as explained from an evolutionary point of view is flawed as in the ways of chance. The Miller-Urey experiment showed the synthesizing amino acids by passing electric sparks through methane gas produced proteins, which could have been the origin of life. It has been proven by Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe that the odds against the required ten to twenty amino acids coming together to form an enzyme is only one chance out of 10^20. Seeing the size of the Earth and the billions of years that could have been passed, this calculation might have been probable. But they also pointed out that there are 2,000 different enzymes made out of amino acids, so all of those to have been formed by chance is a whopping one out of 10^40,000 odds. This added on to the previous analogy of the black and white balls would make the origin of life basically impossible. This argument of the origin of life is seriously flawed in these ways. Evolution is said to have been the key to the complexity of life. Evolutionary development occurs because of random mutations producing new features, and those features that are advantageous to survival is kept, and the result is us today. This method of explaining the irreducibly complex systems like the eye, immune system, or the blood-clotting mechanisms is not proficient enough by just saying,""Evolution did it"". No one has ever stated on exactly how this all happened by random mutation and natural selection. Con states of the resurrection of Jesus, ""no evidence is presented that such an event ever happened. No witnesses were present that we know of, as all the supposed ones are nameless and even the gospels are anonymous"". This is a false statement. First off, the gospel's authors are clearly known and recognized even by the community of skeptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Everyone, including the skeptics, all realize that the gospels were written 40-100 years after Jesus' death, still eyewitness material. Archaeologists have discovered more than 24,000 manuscripts in existence, the oldest dating back to the second century. This is the greatest amount of manuscripts produced in existence, trumping the runner-up, The Illiad, with 650. There are other ways to support Jesus' resurrection. Gary Habermas, author of Historical Jesus, has detailed 39 ancient sources outside the Bible for more than 100 facts about Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection. Morality is something within all of humankind. Even the most devoted atheists are outraged if someone they love is brutally murdered. Why should they? Why not treat them like chemical accidents like they think they are? Why is murder of a human different from a lion killing another lion? Why do we condemn criminals? This is all because of the belief that humans are more valuable than animals and are responsible for their moral actions. People are judged through their choices in life, unlike the lion who killed its own kind. And if the atheist says that morality is just a choice, no one really believes that. For they all know that morality is beyond the subjective, personal choice. We know we are not like animals.

Sed1fbd0b-Ad4a5ba9e	Proof That God is Real	"I would also like to thank you for being very considerate and civil with this debate. I would also like to give my sympathies about your father, and I know how painful the death of a close one can be. I would like to make my final argument with these points: 1) While it is true that Judaism and Christianity were early monotheistic (one God) religions, they were in no means the first. Most religious historians will point to Zoroastrianism as the world first monotheist religion, so again, what puts the Christian God above that God or the God of any other religion? Personally, I would say nothing, and it comes down to cultural differences that makes you say that the Christian God is the true God, much the same that if you had been born in Iraq you would believe that Allah and the Islamic principles are the one true God and one true religion. 2) I have no qualms about someone using God and religion as a source of morale guidance and as a spiritual center, but I do take issue with someone seeing God as the ultimate creator. That does a huge discredit to science and what we have discovered about the natural world. We have discovered so many amazing systems that allow that govern the universe and allow it to continue its ever going change and expansion that just saying ""God did it all"" almost makes it seem unimpressive in comparison. To think that billions of years of evolution lead to seems so much more awe-inspiring and poetic than to just think God snapped his fingers and man was made. 3) While there are certainly issues with the various scientific theories as to the origins of life, they hold much more weight for most scientists than the God hypothesis. The fact that Charles Darwin had no concept of genetics does not discredit his theory of evolution, if anything, it further shows how much weight the theory has, since genetics was actually able to provide a vehicle for the changes we see in species from generation to generation. Meanwhile, there has been no evidence beyond blind faith that would support the existence of God. This is surprising because there are many, many ways that other theories could be disproven. For instance, if just ONE fossil was found in a geographically incorrect place, then basically the entirety of evolution would be thrown out the window, but that hasn't happened. In conclusion, thus far, we have found very little, if not zero, proof that would point to the existence of God. It is simply illogical and in the face of theories that have been tested and peer reviewed, the God hypothesis is a failed theory that exists on blind faith and belief alone. Once again, thank you for this debate and I look forward to see how the vote turns out."	CON	897
Sed1fbd0b-Aa2f52db8	Proof That God is Real	"Here are my responses to your questions: 1.) To change my mind on the existence of God, you would have to provide testable, scientific proof that supports the God hypothesis. I would expect the same treatment with any theory. Just as an anecdote, if someone told me that hot water freezes faster than cold water, I would want proof of this. They could show me one of several things: they could show me a scientific report on the Mpemba effect, they could show me a chart describing the Mpemba effect to provide a better visual of the molecular activity that explains this phenomenon, or they could always use a timer and two buckets of water to actually show me that hot water freezes faster than cold water. Any one of those things would change my mind on that hypothesis, so something with equal academic merit and scientific logic behind it would change my mind on the God hypothesis. 2.) Considering that I do not currently believe in a God, I do not expect Him to prove anything to me, I expect that the followers of God and those that truly believe in him to prove to me that God exists. I personally do not believe in fairies, so I wouldn't expect a fairy to prove their existence to me, I would expect a believer in fairies to prove their existence to me. 3.) As with the last point, I do not believe in a God, so therefore I do not believe it is neccessary OR even possible for Him to prove anything to anyone. One accurate thing you do state in your argument is that many have tried and failed to prove God's existence to me. One of the main reasons is because, like with your scripture examples, they often try and make their arguments based on morality. A common question posed to me and other atheists is ""How can you have morality without God?"" I answer that with ""quite easily."" I believe that my sense of morality doesn't have to come from a ""God,"" but rather from myself and my philosophies. I choose not to kill not because God told me not to, but rather because I can see the consequences it will have for me and for the family of the victim and my own family. I choose not to steal, not because God told me not to, but because I know the circumstances if I am caught and the impacts that my stealing can have for the owner of the good. I choose to respect my parents, not because God told me to, but because I am appreciative of what they have done to raise me and know of the many sacrifices they have made in life for me. Personally, I see this as a higher stance for morality because it is based on one's own actions and one's own standard that they set for themselves, not so that I can please some grand creator because a book says what this person does or does not like his creations to do. However, I see no where in your argument where you offer any proof of God, beyond the story of a rich man and the beggar and your personal belief that ""those who are seeking proof really do want to know Him."" I personally would like to seek proof that would change my mind about God and, at that point, would like to know him, the same way that I would want for any scientific hypothesis. With the theory of evolution, for example, I once sought proof so that I could further to get know the theory. The difference between the theory of evolution and the God hypothesis, however, is that proof was provided to me towards evolution so that I could further my understanding of evolution; no such evidence has been provided as to proof of God's existence. I would like to end my argument with these questions for you: 1.) Beyond Biblical scripture, what evidence do you have that God exists? 2.) What could I say that would change your mind to think differently as to God's existence? 3.) Do you approach your belief in God from a spiritual or a scientific standpoint? If you approach it spiritually, then from the very nature of science, God can neither be proven nor disproven. If you approach it from a scientific standpoint, then how do you account for the lacking evidence that would support the existence of God?"	CON	898

God is Spirit, and you want natural proof of His existence. You are looking at science to prove the existence of God but He is the ultimate scientist. Creation itself testifies to this. Science is ever changing, and proof today might be different tomorrow. One example of that would be the Volcanism hypothesis. During the 1980""s most believed that what led to the extinction of dinosaurs was volcanic activity that spewed gas, ash and dust into the atmosphere over a long period of time so that it kept sunlight from reaching Earth's surface, which led to the loss of plant growth and ultimately led to the demise of the dinosaurs. It wasn""t until 1991 that the famous Yucatan Peninsula crater was discovered, and this shook up the scientific community. With that in mind, scientific evidence can not make the claim that theories are the, ""ultimate truth."" Science, (or at least our understanding of it) is always changing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ""2.) Considering that I do not currently believe in a God, I do not expect Him to prove anything to me, I expect that the followers of God and those that truly believe in him to prove to me that God exists. I personally do not believe in fairies, so I wouldn't expect a fairy to prove their existence to me, I would expect a believer in fairies to prove their existence to me."" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If it were possible for us to go back thirty years in time without the knowledge that we have today, you would believe the accepted scientific evidence for the cause of dinosaur extinction. You as well as most people, would accept that evidence because science made the claim. But if you did have the knowledge and were able to present the now accepted evidence, the 1980""s era would most likely not agree with you and would dismiss the evidence that you provide. So now your only recourse would be to ask them to investigate it for themselves. Now if we were to travel thirty years into the future there is a high probability that there will be completely different scientific evidence that explains the extinction of dinosaurs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ""3.) As with the last point, I do not believe in a God, so therefore I do not believe it is neccessary OR even possible for Him to prove anything to anyone."" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I will argue that this is precisely the reason why most who doubt, won""t find the evidence you""re looking for. Even with scientific discoveries, all it took was one person who believed in possibilities beyond understanding. Now I mentioned in my original argument that I would use the bible, and although you disregard it as being true, I would hope that you will consider the passage that I share. I will paraphrase a bit, and if you would like to read it for yourself, the passage comes from Luke Ch. 24. In the account that is written, Jesus had been crucified and was in the tomb. The disciples hadn""t grasped what Jesus had told them, that He would raise from the dead after three days. There are two disciples traveling together on the road to Emmaus (a city.) As they are walking, a man approaches them and walks and talks with them. They did not recognize the man nor even consider that this man was Jesus. As they are walking, he begins to talk with them about prophetic scriptures and elaborating on those scriptures to them in a way that has their interest. They are approaching a city, and they ask this man to abide with them through in the city for the night. The man agrees. I""ll post the next two verses: Luke 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. Luke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. There are a few hidden rules contained in the entire passage. 1. One will not recognize Jesus unless HE reveals who He is to them. These two disciples were believers but their eyes hadn""t been opened yet. 2. They recognized the knowledge and wisdom of the man who walked with them on the road, and they asked Him to abide with them. Now Jesus did not reveal His true identity to everyone, but to those who believed. The disciples on the road to Emmaus obviously believed because they recognized the wisdom in what the man said, and they asked him to abide with them. As I stated in my original message, the only way for anyone to know for sure, is through a personal relationship in Christ Jesus. Doubt is like a big blindfold. The more a person doubts, the more difficult it is to actually see. To answer your questions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ""1.) Beyond Biblical scripture, what evidence do you have that God exists?"" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A personal relationship, is my personal evidence. Along with personal subjective experience. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ""2.) What could I say that would change your mind to think differently as to God's existence?"" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There no human alive that could cause me to doubt what I know is true. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3.) Do you approach your belief in God from a spiritual or a scientific standpoint? If you approach it spiritually, then from the very nature of science, God can neither be proven nor disproven. If you approach it from a scientific standpoint, then how do you account for the lacking evidence that would support the existence of God? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I believe that the only approach is through a spiritual standpoint. A heart that is willing to ask, ""God, do you exist, and will you help my unbelief?"" Is the heart that will be changed from the need for proof to the desire to know everything about Him that a person can comprehend. A changed heart will bring that desire to want to draw near to God. With all of the uncertainty in this world, a heart that is set on Him will find the truth. Thank you for your very thoughtful and intelligent response"	PRO	899
Sed1fbd0b-A91764cad	Proof That God is Real	"First I would like to say thank you for being very considerate. This is actually the first debate In which I have ever taken part, and I""m excited that my contender is offering well considered points and perspectives. I agree that science is an integral part of our learning about the world around us. Yet with ever-changing scientific discoveries and theories nobody can say at any moment that any theory is absolute truth. Which is why they are called theories. Just to be clear, I did not refer to advances in science as being a ""folly"". However, the folly that I believe resides in the need for scientific proof alone is that there can""t be any solid proof in which a person can hold a firm stance. I am not anti-science. My own father passed away years ago after having heart surgery that was, at that time, very risky. Today, because of scientific and medical advancements, that same surgery is a simple low-risk procedure. So, I am thankful for the continuous advancements, which in my view, does not diminish from the existence of God, but speaks loudly to fact that God is far higher than us in every single way, and it is because of His very creation that we can attain to any advancements at all. I am not one who believes that science will prove the existence of God. If the amazingly organized intelligent aspects of scientific discoveries hasn't caused one to recognize that there is a much higher force behind creation, then there's nothing that I can say that will change a person's mind. Just as I quoted in my original argument: Luke 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. It is the same principle. As with the evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin, and the anti-Christ opinions of many in this world today isn't it our individual responsibility to search out the truth personally? If, in the end we are wrong at least we can say that we did our best to search it out and did not rely on opinions and theories. Will a theory or an opinion make a difference in the end? I think not. What we find as being absolutely true, will. Just for the sake of the argument presented, my take on evolution is this. There are many who disagree with the theory of evolution. For each scientific ""proof,"" or rather, theory, there are equally convincing arguments that offer ""proof,' that is just as solid. Charles Darwin had no understanding of genetic coding. This is not to dismiss his intellect, but while the theory of evolution was being ""theorized,"" genetic coding was many years away from being discovered. As you know, I""m sure, that genetic coding dictates the offspring that any living creature will produce. For there to be changes in any genetic code, as Mendel""s laws of genetics demonstrates. (Although even Mendel's theory has been changed.) there are definite limitations. There isn't any case where different species of animals have bred and produced an entirely different species. There definitely have been differences in specific animals bit those differences can even be observed by us today. Two different breeds of a dog would produce perhaps a small dog or a large dog, a long haired dog or a short haired dog. Yet, the dogs that are produced remain dogs as is the case with every living creature. The encoded genetics dictate what any creature will produce and its traits. In order for there to be an entirely new trait intertwined in an animal's DNA, there would have to be new genetics introduced. Although certain traits may lie dormant for unknown amounts of time I have never heard of any case where dogs produce a cow, or cats produced a mouse. I have no relatives that are monkey, (although that in itself is debatable.) I would think that science today has the technology to introduce something new into an already genetically encoded string, but that would involve some sort of intervention and although there are recorded cases of genetic ""flukes,"" even on those rare occasions, it takes a lot of speculation to form the idea that there is some sort of other species in a genealogical line. If you look at a chart that depicts evolution we can start at the beginning, with a monkey. There is no argument that there are still monkeys in existence today. We can look at the end of the chart which depicts man, and we can say with certainty that there are still men today. Where are all the creatures in-between? One would think that each one survived long enough to leave behind tremendous amounts of evidence of domination for a decent period of time, but the evidence is sparse at best. I don""t usually spend time researching evidence for evolution as I personally do not believe that it is accurate, but every ten years or so some single skeletal remains are found and science immediately jumps to the conclusion that they have found the ever-evasive missing link. Let""s examine the world religions. The bible acknowledges the existence of different religions even in the very first book (Genesis.) So today's mixture of religions is really nothing new. The bible states this: Isaiah 40:21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? If you research world religions and different time frames, all have a documented beginning, (and some have a documented end.) Christianity and Judaism both adhere to the belief that God has always existed and directly conveyed His will to mankind at the very foundation of the earth as the above verse shows. If you research all the way back to Nimrod and Babylon, the separation and divisions that took place and the religions that have formed since that time, you will see that there are similarities today that tie directly to the different religions that have formed on this earth throughout history. The bible bears historical record of many different beliefs systems, from the followers of ""Dagon,"" to followers of the ""goddess Diana."" If you feel drawn to research these different belief systems, you will even find that many times there is a common denominator that involves a serpent symbol and in other cases, a moon sliver and a star. I can even name a so-called Christian denomination that uses the serpent symbol as part of it""s base system, and refers to it as the ""white snake,"" or ""quasi quatro,"" I will leave that to you to look into. I certainly hope that you will because if nothing else, you will have even more knowledge than you""ve already displayed in your wonderful and well thought-out responses. I must add that in the bible, the other different religions that were present were never once considered to be based on the same God. For there is only one God and His name is Yahweh. This brings me back to my original statement. ""There is nothing that I could say that would cause a person to believe."" Ultimately, the burden of proof comes down to each person seeking it out in Christ Jesus for themselves. If it""s proof that a person seeks, then ask HIM sincerely. Thank you for taking part in this debate. I look forward to your final response. A big thank you to all who added comments and brought forward great points for consideration."	PRO	900

S1cce27af-A208e3e0b	The God of classical theism is real.	"Let me begin by thanking my opponent for his willingness to put his beliefs on the line. However, twsurber, I would like you to appreciate how odd it is that you must cling to spurious ‘mysteries' and circular arguments in order to keep yourself from tumbling into unbelief. Before I launch into my main arguments in this essay, allow me to make one minor digression. It isn't directly related to the resolution, but it is an interesting diversion nonetheless. ::Do we have the freedom to choose our beliefs ?:: My antagonist has alluded to the notion that people have the freedom to choose their beliefs. However, such a freedom is simply non-existent or incredibly negligible if it does exist. Simply put, people don't have direct control over their own beliefs anymore than they have control over their genetic makeup. This may sound like a rather odd claim, but hear me out. If you believe that humans can choose their beliefs, then you must do the following. Convince yourself that you are at the beach right now. As you are reading this, convince yourself that you are actually on a beach in Malibu. Can you do it? I didn't think so. Of course, you can pretend you're at the beach, but in order to believe you are at the beach you must be convinced that you aren't simply trying to delude yourself. If humans even have any freedom to choose their beliefs, then this freedom is almost certainly minimal. Surely, people cannot believe in propositions that they take to be untrue. =====> Why I Am Still Not A Christian <===== Contention 1: The Evidential Argument From Evil Unfortunately, the primary claims of my argument have gone uncontested. In this section I have argued that the assumption that a benevolent God does not exist is a much better and far more reasonable fit for the data than the proposition that such a being exists. In fact, the evidence of nature's indifference to life on Earth surrounds us. To take just one more example, every year approximately 15,000,000 children die of hunger. [1] That averages out to about 41,095 deaths each day, 1,712 each hour, and 28 each minute. God's ways are, indeed, unfathomable. On a side note, the evidence of the Earth's antiquity is abundant and conclusive. Over the past hundred years, scientists have measured the age of the Earth through dozens of different methods, including radiometric dating, and those methods all point to the approximate age of 4.6 billion years. [2] The notion that the Earth is young is equally as preposterous as the belief that the Earth is flat. It is simply an accident of history that a belief in a young Earth is not synonymous with mental illness. That is, in essence, how detached such a proposition is from the facts. Had Christianity not become ascendant, we would be treating people who believe the Earth is young in the same way we treat people who believe they are in contact with extra terrestrials from an alternate dimension. Contention 2: The Argument From Divine Hiddenness For quick reference, I have put up the argument one last time. 1. If God exists, God: (a) wants all humans to believe God exists before they die; (b) can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die; (c) does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and (d) always acts in accordance with what it most wants. 2. If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die. (From 1) 3. But not all humans believe God exists before they die. .: Therefore, God does not exist. (From 2 and 3) I must admit to being genuinely frustrated at this point. My opponent's response to the argument isn't rooted in any kind of logic. ""2. Nonconcur. According to Scripture, God does exist. According to Scripture, humans have the free will to choose."" -twsurber The argument doesn't have anything to do with free will. If God exists and wants all humans to believe this before they die he could appear before the world in order to demonstrate his existence. According to the Bible itself, God did this with Moses on Mt Sinai and he also revealed himself to other people through Jesus. So, even from a biblical perspective, God could bring about a situation whereby everyone believed in him without compromising their free will. "".: Nonconcur. According to Scripture, God exists."" -twsurber Appeals to authority are not a rational basis to reject the conclusion of a syllogism. As of this point, the argument remains completely intact. Contention 3: The Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit My opponent has conceded this argument in my favor by failing to respond to it twice in a row. Simply accusing an argument of being without merit is not a rational objection to any argument. =====> ‘Why I Am A Christian' - twsurber <===== Contention 1: ‘The Bible Proves God Exists' ""My single contention is thus: I accept that the Bible is absolute truth. The Bible verifies God's existence. If the Bible is rejected by any human being, then that human being is also rejecting the existence of God."" I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind my opponent's beautifully circular argument. However, I don't find it compelling, and I don't think the voters should find it compelling either. ::Conclusion:: I've given three powerful arguments that demonstrate that God probably doesn't exist. Unfortunately, my antagonist hasn't given a serious objection to any of them. Every single issue my opponent has with my arguments is either scientifically or philosophically lacking. Moreover, the only argument he did give in favor of God's existence is patently fallacious. Quite obviously, the motion has been defeated. ::References:: 1. http://library.thinkquest.org... 2. http://www.talkorigins.org..."	CON	903
S1cce27af-Afc1ca69b	The God of classical theism is real.	"I would like to thank my for the Malibu Beach beach, it is in fact one of my very favorite beaches that I have had the opportunity to visit. Unfortunately, as I look out the window, as I am typing no less, and 3 inches of snow, I am convinced that I am not at Malibu Beach. I am somewhat mystified by my opponent's lack of confidence that he hasn't the free will to choose what he believes. He has stated more than once that he is not a Christian. That is a choice. He could choose to be one, yet he has chosen not to be. Many opportunities in life are a choice. On his very profile, my opponent indicates that he supports Barack Obama. Did he have the free will to choose Obama? Or was Obama assigned to him? Or did he choose Obama based on a comparison of available options? Why wasn't I assigned to Obama? Because we have the free will to choose. I appreciate many of Obama's ideas, however, Alan Keyes' platform better represents what I have CHOSEN to believe with own free will. Re-examining my opponent's arguments. 1.evil a. God does not cause evil. God allows evil. Extended, to say that God causes evil is an admission to God's existence. b To do good or to do evil is choice. A person can be choose to nice or they can choose to be cruel. c. God COULD make everything pleasant all the time, and FORCE everyone to believe in Him. God has not done this, He has allowed us the freedom to choose. 2. Human Reasoning a. My opponent fails to look at the argument through what John Calvin referred to as the spectacles of faith. My opponent has restricted his vision through the eyes of human comprehension based upon human discoveries in the less than perfect field of science. b. To the contrary, my opponent has provided nothing compelling for me to disbelieve. He has only provided examples limited to human ingenuity. To answer my opponent's question, I find it absolutely odd that 93% of the so-called ""educated"" dismiss God and the Bible and will choose to spend their eternity in the Lake of Fire for their unbelief. According to Scripture, (John 3:18)Failure to believe condemns a person to the Lake of Fire. God will not allow the mentally impaired to perish. Why? They do not possess the faculties to make such a choice. While Freeman and I are presently opponents, ultimately I truly hope for and will cheer for Freeman to accept Jesus as his savior before it is too late. According to Scripture, God's preservation and providence account for the continuity of the earth. Statistical improbability yet again reverts to limiting oneself to reliance upon a flawed system, which is a choice by the way. The answers you seek are in Scripture. Yet, you have chosen to reinvent the wheel by a less accurate method, science. Perhaps my opponent's self admitted frustration lies in the fact that he cannot convince me that Scripture is wrong. My frustration with my opponent is that he has limited himself to arguing with human reasoning and logic; but refuses to venture into the supernatural realm. Because we live in a society of continually progressive moral decay, I am supremely confident that the voters with similar notions to my opponent will vote as such. Unfortunately, I am equally confident that if they do not begin thinking outside of the box that Satan has entrapped them, they will join the 93% of modern academia in the lake of Fire. At which point it will too late to see that not only were they incorrect in their hypothesis, but also that the PRO should have won this debate. Thanks!"	PRO	904
S1cce27af-A103d9bbf	The God of classical theism is real.	"I thank twsurber for accepting my challenge. However, I must admit that I am rather disappointed with his last round. It suffers from a serious lack of effort. =====> Why I Am Still Not A Christian <===== :: Evolution and Creationism:: ""Evolution and Creation are models that cannot be repeated in a test, therefore people are free to choose which they will accept."" - twsurber I'm not sure why my opponent is bringing up this point about creationism since I have already written that evolution does not logically discredit the existence of God. But now that he has brought up the subject, allow me to give some input. We know for a fact that humans and all other animals are related in terms of their ancestry. Among other strands of evidence for evolution, all animals share the same genetic coding, DNA. And we can use this code to compare the genetic sequences of any two species of animal in order to determine how closely related they are. As it turns out, humans share 98 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees [1], and we share less with our more distant cousins, elephants. This process of comparative DNA testing can be done with any two species of animals. Moreover, all of this genetic evidence forms a beautiful hierarchical family tree. We (homo sapiens) are but one twig on that tree, and we are related with every other living organism on the planet, including bacteria and plants. Contention 1: The Evidential Argument From Evil My opponent's assertion that suffering is the result of sin is not only unfounded, it simply misses the point of this section. Even if I were to grant the rather dubious theological contentions that my opponent is assuming, then his assertion that suffering is the result of sin still cannot withstand scrutiny. We know for a fact that suffering could not have been caused by the sins of humans because suffering and death predate the emergence of Homo sapiens. For hundreds of millions of years, billions of different creatures have experienced the cruelness of life as they worked their way through the war of nature. [2] As stated earlier, all of this evidence points to the conclusion that there are probably no superintending forces that work on humanity's behalf. Contention 2: The Argument From Divine Hiddenness ""Simply because people refuse to believe that God exists, does not mean the He doesn't. It merely means they refused to accept that God existed."" - twsurber I'm afraid that my opponent doesn't seem to understand the argument. Consequently, he went on to create a rather irrelevant analogy with the Country of Eritrea. The premise of the argument is not that God couldn't exist because people don't believe in Him. Obviously, that would be an absurd hypothesis. The argument contends that if God existed and wanted people to believe in him, then unbelief should not occur. And since unbelief does occur, then God probably doesn't exist. Moreover, the argument has been formulated according to the rigors of logic. My opponent simply can't deny the conclusion if it follows logically from the premises. In order to show why the argument fails, he must show why one of the premises is unsound. 1. If God exists, God: (a) wants all humans to believe God exists before they die; (b) can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die; (c) does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and (d) always acts in accordance with what it most wants. 2. If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die. (From 1) 3. But not all humans believe God exists before they die. .: Therefore, God does not exist. (From 2 and 3) Contention 3: The Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit This argument went completely unchallenged. How unfortunate… ::Conclusion:: I'm really at a loss for words at the end of this second round. My opponent has said almost nothing of relevance that pertains to this debate. Instead, he has simply decided to quote random Bible verses and advance illogical rebuttals to the arguments I have already put forth. Moreover, giving a list of arguments is not the same as actually making them. If twsurber thinks that one of the various cosmological or ontological arguments is valid, then he must argue that much in his next round, so that I give it a proper critique. Hopefully, the next round will be more promising. ::References:: 1. http://www.scientificamerican.com... 2. Youtube video http://www.youtube.com..."	CON	905
S1cce27af-A1cf847f7	The God of classical theism is real.	"I initally misread the intent of the resolution and the intent of the debate. In support of my opponent's argument, I offer the following and concede this point to the CON. Scripture clearly indicates that not everyone will accept God. Failing to accept God is the same as rejecting Him. Thus I stipulate that not everyone will accept that God exists. This admission, for all intents and purposes, most likely concedes the win to my opponent in the eys of secular voters. Fortunately, this debate has no affect on my salvation. I will, however, continue the discussion. Opponent's C-1: I nonconcur that billions of species have suffered for hundreds of millions of years on the basis that science cannot prove the that the earth is that old. It is taken from an assumed hypothesis of ""all things constant"". Further, where did life originate if not from God? Science relies on testing and inference from imperfect human beings whereas, according to Scripture, God is omniscient. Opponent's C-2: According to Scripture, God gave human beings a free will to choose. God, being omnipotent, has the ability to force belief, but rather allows human beings the oppotunity to believe or disbelieve. 1a. Concur, God would like everyone to believe before they die. 1b. Concur, God can, but doesn't force cooperation. 1c. Concur 1d. split. God wants our devotion by willingness 2. Nonconcur. According to Scripture, God does exist. According to Scripture, humans have the free will to choose. 3. Concur. According to Scripture, not all humans will believe that God exists before they die. .: Nonconcur. According to Scripture, God exists. Opponent's C-3: I dropped this argument because I found it to be without merit. I do not value the opinion of Richard Dawkins because he is not omniscient. No human being can say with any certainty that evolution is accurate. I do, hoever, value the opinion of God. According to Scripture, God is omniscient, and therefore is the only credible source. This begs the next question, who will you entrust your soul to? An imperfect human being such as Richard Dawkins? Or the God of the Bible who offers the gift of salvation to all who will choose to accept it? I will not attempt to defend the cosmological, teleological, and ontological arguments. I merely wanted to mention their existence as beloved ""scientific"" explanations that sometimes accepted. Rather, I base all of my faith in the watershed doctrine of the Holy Bible. My single contention is thus: I accept that the Bible is absolute truth. The Bible verifies God's existence. If the Bible is rejected by any human being, then that human being is also rejecting the existence of God. While I apologize to the commenters and my opponent for the lack of a ""quality"" argument in secular terms, I trust I have provided a Biblical argument that is."	PRO	906
S8330f626-A691b9fe1	Jew World Order is real	"Introduction In this debate, my opponent has set out to prove that there is a unified conspiracy by Jewish people to control the world. However, the evidence he has provided for the claim is sorely lacking. Rebuttals 1. Many bankers are Jewish We must remember that this debate is about a ""Jew World Order"", that is, a unified conspiracy by powerful Jewish people to control the world. My opponent has argued that because many of the top bankers are Jewish, there is a unified conspiracy of Jews controlling the world. While being rich does give you more influence, and many rich people are Jewish, my opponent has not shown that they""re all working together towards some sort of unified goal or conspiracy. Thus, this argument isn""t relevant to the topic. The Jewish people were historically the ones who worked in the banking industry because they have fewer religious restrictions on Usury, and this tradition simply was inherited today. [1] This indicates that the Jewish bankers became bankers out of circumstance rather than conspiracy. 2. The Jewish people delayed the abolishment of slavery The Jews made up a small proportion of slaveowners in the south, and didn""t start the Southern tradition of slavery; they simply adopted it as they assimilated in the United States. Thus, because they were a minority of slave-owners, their actions were not important in keeping slavery alive.[2] 3. The democrats are not supported because of their stances on Zionism My opponent has stated that the Democrat party isn""t being supported for being anti-Zionist. This is despite the fact that many Jewish Democrats, including Bernie Sanders and Feinstein, have made criticisms towards Israel. The fact that all of the Jewish politicians in the US Federal Government support the usually anti-Zionist Democratic party shows that they aren""t in a concerted effort to push Zionism, which would be the case if my opponent""s ideas were true.

Evidence is Israeli presidents and other leading politicians saying they control America and that the Jews are a superior race. Evidence is people like Henry (((Kissinger))) saying the United States are working for Israel and the fact that Jews have absolute control of Hollywood which can really shape the way you think.

S8330f626-A658f5790	Jew World Order is real	"The Jews still control everything. They have always controlled everything and created degeneracy and even the ancient Romans wrote about this. DIO CASSIUS. Second century Roman historian. Describing the savage Jewish uprising against the Roman empire that has been acknowledged as the turning point downward in the course of that great state-form: ""The Jews were destroying both Greeks and Romans. They ate the flesh of their victims, made belts for themselves out of their entrails, and daubed themselves with their blood... In all, 220,000 men perished in Cyrene and 240,000 in Cyprus, and for this reason no Jew may set foot in Cyprus today."" (Roman History) If you are paying attention, you will notice that a very significant amount of the people pushing for ethnic diversity and race-mixing are Jewish or of Jewish descent. However, if the Jews themselves were race-mixers, there would be no Ashkenazi Jews. They roamed the world for over 5000 years with no homeland, but they still exist. Why? Because Jews think that they are better than us. The Talmud says that us non-Jews are cattle, only here to serve the chosen people. Only 2% of non-Jewish households had slaves in America, but 40% of Jewish households had them. Now the Jews say white people need to feel guilty. American founding fathers did not want Jews in their country. This prophecy, by Benjamin Franklin, was made in a ""CHIT CHAT AROUND THE TABLE DURING INTERMISSION,"" at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787. This statement was recorded in the dairy of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a delegate from South Carolina. ""I fully agree with General Washington, that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. The menace, gentlemen, is the Jews. In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded, by objecting to its restrictions; have built up a state within the state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal. For over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other people not of their race. If you do not exclude them from these United States, in their Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our liberty. If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves. Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatics, let them be born where they will nor how many generations they are away from Asia, they will never be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American's, and will not even thou they live among us ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots.

S8330f626-A36c33fe1	Jew World Order is real	Introduction The world is full of people of all kinds of ethnicities. While all people of one ethnicity might share something in common, for the Jewish people, an insidious desire to take over the world that almost everyone else doesn’t know about is certainly not one of these shared traits. Thus, I oppose the motion that this house believes that Jewish people control everything. Signpost Today, I shall first rebut my opponent’s arguments, and then put forth two points on my own: firstly, that many major world events were not orchestrated by Jews, and secondly, that the Jewish people aren’t in a conspiracy to control the country because their voting patterns appear to be the opposite of what would be expected if that were the case. Rebuttals My opponent has claimed that the Jewish people believe that they are superior to other races. One point of evidence that he brought up was that the Jewish people made up a disproportionately large portion of the slaveowning population in the southern United States. However, different calculations suggest that a similar percentage of Jewish households had slaves compared to the average percentage for all households, showing that there was little to no difference. [3] My opponent has also claimed that the Jewish people were dishonest in saying that white people and only white people should be guilty. First of all, where are the Jewish people telling current-day white people to feel guilty? Secondly, do they limit the statement to white people? Third, do they make up a significant amount of the Jewish population? Finally, do they make up enough of the population of influential people to make a difference? My opponent has also quoted a text that states that the Jews would change our government and destroy the United States to benefit themselves. Yet, currently a minority of the Congress and U.S. House of Representatives consists of Jewish people, and the Jewish politicians in the two bodies all belong to or side with the Democratic party, which has been criticised for anti-Zionism. [1][2] For instance, Jewish politician Bernie Sanders, who has sided with the Democrats, has repeatedly criticised Israel's actions and urged for increased financial aid to Middle Eastern areas.[4] Plus, the Jews have made no major changes to the governmental system. The facts clearly demonstrate that the Jewish people aren’t a part of an unified conspiracy to control everything, and that they aren’t all trying to give themselves all the benefits. My opponent has also cited a quote that supposedly demonstrates Jewish misdeeds in the far past. Yet this debate is about whether there is currently a “Jew World Order” controlling everything, so even if true, this is irrelevant. Constructive arguments 1. Numerous world events have occurred without direct Jewish influence If this resolution, that everything is controlled by the Jews, was true, then why have numerous historical events happened without Jewish influence? My opponent has claimed that the founding fathers didn’t want Jews to be in the United States. Thus, he is conceding that the founding of the United States, a major world event, did’t happen because the Jews were directly behind the founding fathers and directly controlling their actions. 2. There is no unified attempt by Jewish people to conspire against everyone else If there were a “Jew World Order”, then we’d expect that most, if not all, Jewish politicians would work towards goals that would benefit the Jewish people and aid in Zionism. Yet there’s no unified attempt by Jewish politicians to do that; instead, we see that most Jewish voters and all Jewish Congress and U.S. House of Representative members side with the Democratic party, which often votes against Pro-Zionist foreign policies to the point that Jewish opinion writers have condemned them as “Jew haters” or even anti-semitic.[1][2] This is not a hallmark that the Jews are “trying to take over the world”; rather, it shows that many Jewish voters and politicians are doing the exact opposite.

Jews have been kicked out of 109 countries for a reason. The founding fathers also wanted to abolish slavery, that didn't happen. Jews had more power than them. Jews are not voting for democrats because they don't support (((our greatest ally)))/Zionism, but because they support degeneracy. The democratic party is in control right now. Yet they have done nothing to support the Middle East or to go against (((our greatest ally))). POPE CLEMENT VIII ""All the world suffers from the usury of the Jews, their monopolies and deceit. They have brought many unfortunate people into a state of poverty, especially the farmers, working class people and the very poor.

And philosophy needs to hold science and religion up to the philosophical light bulb to find the true religion, the true philosophy and the true science.

These things are the laws that we ""know"" to be true and even faith in God to reveal himself even if your not sure who he is or if he is at the moment.

And you define philosophy as the pursuit to find what is true. What's the difference there? There has to be one in order for this to be a legitimate debate. Rather, as I already stated, philosophy precedes both science and religion. It is the search for what is true. You say i misunderstand what you meant for religion. This may be. But even under your definition of the search for the true religion, there are many ends to that. I too am ""on God's side."" But for those who believe something different from me, they believe that they have found the one true religion. This means that there still are conflicting religions under the banner of religion. Therefore they cannot point to the same truth. You give the analogy of three runners who are going in different ways, but need to be helping each other. The first part of this is a great analogy for what we are talking about. The only problem is that if they are going in different directions, they cannot help each other. Either they are all going towards the same end, which i've proven is impossible, or they aren't. Since they aren't, they cannot point to a common and real truth. You say that science should back up religion. I believe that too. But what each individual item is, is not the same thing. One has to do with a set of beliefs while the other has to do with fact. Since they are dealing with two different things, then how can they point to the same end. They do intersperse a little, but not enough to have the same end. It would be like three runners running towards different goals whose paths cross every once in a while. They may be able to help a little, but still are not going to the same goal."	CON	913

S28feca15-A2e702344	Free Will is Real and Compatible with Determinism	"I'd like to thank my opponent for the debate challenge. I hope this will be an interesting debate for both of us (and maybe even for the audience). My opponent has clearly defined what he means by free will, and I accept his definition. However, by this definition, free will does not exist. My opponent claims the following things in the resolution: 1. That given a certain precise physical circumstance, a living being would be capable of choosing between multiple possibilities of how to react, rather than being led to one choice by deterministic forces. 2. That the above does not contradict determinism. My opponent is wrong on both counts. First I will respond to my opponent's arguments. ====== RESPONSE TO OPPONENT I agree with my opponent's definition of Determinism: ""causality is responsible for all events of the past, present and future."" My opponent claims that it is scientifically verifiable that ""animate beings respond to cause and effect differently than does inanimate matter."" This is not a scientifically verifiable fact - it is mere conjecture for which my opponent has provided no evidence. I ask my opponent to provide in his next round the scientific evidence that verifies his assertion. My opponent makes the argument that ""if determinism is correct, then that means the state of the universe could be calculated just based on the previous states of the universe,"" with the implication that ""that's just mind-boggling."" This is a thinly veiled argument from ignorance. ""I don't understand how that could possibly be, therefore it is not."" That's not good reasoning. My opponent then makes an appeal to consequences. If the universe is deterministic, then he claims that we have no influence on our own destiny. He says that this is less appealing than creating our own destiny, with the implication that this is evidence against determinism. It is not. It is an argument from wishful thinking, which is not good reasoning. My opponent notes that determinists don't accept that living beings can respond to a single specific situation in multiple ways. However, he gives us no reason to believe this premise. He simply claims that it is true, with absolutely no evidence. My opponent notes that causality does not strictly apply to the quantum world. Actually, we don't know this. It's a ramification of the unproven copenhagen interpretation, which also says that the entire macroscopic world is determined by physics.[1] It is indeed possible that quantum effects are entirely deterministic, but we simply do not know how to determine what variables will hold what values - that is to say, we do not have a full understanding of how quantum mechanics works. [2] Also, I'd like to quickly note that while a non-deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics contradicts determinism, it does not affirm free will as defined in this debate (that living matter is not subject to the macroscopic deterministic laws of science). [1] http://abyss.uoregon.edu... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... I'd like to note, before I get to making my own arguments, that my opponent has completely failed to provide actual evidence that free will exists at all. Allow me to now give my arguments. ========= CONTENTION THE FIRST: ARGUMENT FROM ATOMS Humans, like all living matter, are composed of atoms. Atoms obey the deterministic laws of physics, and they are incapable of doing anything that physics does not dictate they do. Our thought processes are the result of atoms moving and creating effects on other atoms within the brain and body. 1. Atoms obey the deterministic laws of physics. 2. Atoms cannot act in a way other than the way physics dictates. 3. Humans are a complex machine made completely of atoms. 4. Humans act in accordance with the deterministic laws of physics and nothing else. ========= CONTENTION THE SECOND: ARGUMENT FROM NEUROSCIENCE Neuroscience has found that decision-making happens in anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and the areas of the brain that create the phenomenon of emotion [1]. These areas of the brain all receive and send signals based on chemistry and physics. In particular, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seems to be responsible for calculating which of various potential choices is superior [2]. Thus, the portion of consciousness which appears to be capable of ""choosing"" between alternatives is just a lobe in the brain that chemically responds to signals from the rest of the brain. The rest of the brain is likewise composed of lobes that respond to each other and to input signals from the senses. There is no room for a mystical non-deterministic factor in decision-making. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org... ========= CONTENTION THE THIRD: ARGUMENT FROM THE UNIVERSE My opponent freely admits that nonliving matter acts in a deterministic way. I wholeheartedly agree with him on this issue. Let us examine what this entails, however. Let us take the early universe into account. It contained no life, therefore by my opponent's own admission, it was entirely deterministic. Now let us consider what would have to happen for it to cease being deterministic at some time in the future. At some point, atoms would have to deterministically arrange themselves in some way that would later not have to follow the laws of physics. My opponent has provided no evidence for this very extreme claim. In any case, let us examine something else. The earliest ""lifeforms"" were likely self-replicating strings of proteins. Hopefully we can agree that these did not act in a non-deterministic fashion. Later, cells developed. We likely also agree that cells do not have the ability to act in a way other than the one physics and chemistry dictate, despite rudimentary methods for responding to stimuli in complex ways. Plants certainly don't have the ability to decide anything, let alone decide anything using ""free will."" My opponent should probably revise his definition to be more specific about what things don't follow the deterministic laws of physics, and if he could, why or how they manage to become unentwined with the scientific laws of the universe. ========= CONTENTION THE FOURTH: DETERMINISM AND FREE WILL ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE Even my opponent, in his first round, notes that determinists disagree with free will and with the assertion that living matter is non-deterministic. This is quite true by definition - in my opponent's own words, ""Determinism asserts that causality is responsible for all events of the past, present and future."" This would indeed include the actions of living beings, and contradict the definition of free will used in this debate. ========= FINAL WORDS My opponent has not given us a reason to think that living beings are not governed by the deterministic laws of science. I have provided evidence showing that it is at least a much more reasonable assumption that we are governed by deterministic effects (see Contentions 1, 2, and 3). The definition of determinism we are using also contradicts free will, a fact that contradicts the resolution. The resolution cannot be affirmed unless both its claims are true, and I have provided evidence that neither claim is true. Thus, I have negated the resolution. Good luck to my opponent."	CON	915
S28feca15-A3e593e58	Free Will is Real and Compatible with Determinism	"Free will was, traditionally, a philosophical question, although science has begun pursuing the question more vigorously since the development of modern scanning technologies. There has not yet been any solid discoveries made about consciousness or free will. We know next to nothing about the emergent properties of consciousness and free will. I am reluctant to engage in a ""citation war"" when it's merely postulates and hypotheses – not evidence – that can be cited. Such a ""he said, she said"" effort is a waste of time. Of my opponent's 7 ""Responses to Opponent"", 3 of them were Sock Puppet fallacies (putting words in my mouth). In all 3 cases, my opponent went ""quote mining"" to pull quotes out of context and put his own spin on them. I consider this practice to be less than honest. Here's the 3 Sock Puppet fallacies: 1.My opponent makes the argument that ""if determinism is correct, then that means the state of the universe could be calculated just based on the previous states of the universe,"" with the implication that ""that's just mind-boggling."" 2.Also, I'd like to quickly note that while a non-deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics contradicts determinism, it does not affirm free will 3.My opponent then makes an appeal to consequences. If the universe is deterministic, then he claims that we have no influence on our own destiny. He says that this is less appealing than creating our own destiny, with the implication that this is evidence against determinism. #1). There was NO implication that ""that's just mind-boggling"". The mined quote is extracted from under the heading of ""Determinism – Logical Conclusions:"". I was simply expositing standard logical conclusions of determinism – as explicitly indicated by the heading of that section. I'm sure most of you have heard or read the same logical conclusion before. I was also setting up the following scenario in which the fatalism of determinism was emphasized (May the force be with you). #2). Who said anything about quantum mechanics affirming free will? My point was, once again, clearly stated: ""We already know that causality does NOT apply, at all, to the quantum realm; so it's positively NOT true that absolute causality applies to everything. Living beings, therefore, set no precedents by responding differently to causality."" #3). What consequences? This was an appeal to reason, not to consequences. Why would you deny the evidence of your experience, not to mention the enpowerment of free will, for the illusions and fatalism of determinism? The Sock Puppet part comes with the spurious and specious injection of the ""with the implication that this is evidence against determinism"" closing remark. Of the remaining 4 Responses to Opponent, 3 are false and 1 is misleading. The false ones first: 1.My opponent claims that it is scientifically verifiable that ""animate beings respond to cause and effect differently than does inanimate matter."" This is not a scientifically verifiable fact 2.My opponent notes that determinists don't accept that living beings can respond to a single specific situation in multiple ways. However, he gives us no reason to believe this premise. 3.My opponent has completely failed to provide actual evidence that free will exists at all #1). I said ""verifiable"", NOT ""verifed"". The animate mode of response is too observably obvious to bother with experimentation but I'll humor my opponent anyway . . . On a cloudless day, place 2 identical vials of water in direct sunlight and 2 identical twins in the same direct sunlight. I think we already know where this is heading. The 2 vials of water will heat up in unison but, because of motility, consciousness and intelligence, there's no telling what the 2 twins will do. One might strip off her clothes and sunbathe. The other might head for shade. Inanimate objects and animate beings have 2 different modes of response to causality. #2). This is just plain ridiculous. Hello? What has my opponent been reading? Did I not emphasize it enough? Repeat after me: ""The animate mode of response."" Like I said, ""For some reason, most determinists don't (or won't) acknowledge the differences between a living being and a lifeless rock."" #3). I repeat, ""The animate mode of response"". As I stated in my argument, ""Options are what it's all about . . . because options mean choices and choices means free will."" Admittedly, I didn't dwell on this point – because it's too self-evident (to me). I'll dwell on it now. Free will is axiomatic to the act of planning. If you've ever made a plan and executed it, revised a strategy or out-maneuvered an opponent, then you've got empirical evidence of free will. You've learned from causality: adapted to it and extrapolated it into the future -- then chose your options accordingly. You've demonstrated the intelligent mastery of causality it takes to have free will. Everybody lives as if they have free will. They work, play, think and plan as if they have free will. That's a LOT of empirical evidence for free will. Conversely, what's the evidence for the claim that free will is an illusion? And finally, the 1 misleading Response to Opponent. 1.My opponent notes that causality does not strictly apply to the quantum world. Actually, we don't know this. It's a ramification of the unproven copenhagen interpretation, which also says that the entire macroscopic world is determined by physics. #1). Quantum mechanics is all about probabilities. Where to begin? How about the basics? My opponent needs to familiarize himself with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, quantum fluctuations, wave-particle duality, wave function collapse, quantum entanglement, Schrï¿½dinger's cat, photon and radioactive emissions, etc. See: http://en.wikipedia.org... There is no consensus on what the Copenhagen Interpretation is, exactly. However, ALL those who developed it (Heisenberg, Bohr, Schrï¿½dinger, Born, etc.) agree that it is probabilistic and indeterminate. Contemporary popularizers of quantum mechanics (Brian Greene and Michio Kaku) state outright that the quantum realm really is as bizarre, random and unpredictable as it seems. See: http://en.wikipedia.org... Could it be that the quantum realm is only bizarre because we don't understand enough? Possibly. But it appears to be genuinely random and unpredictable by nature. See: http://www.dimaggio.org... My opponent has forced me to waste a lot of time, effort and pixels fending off Sock Puppet fallacies and misrepresentations, leaving me little room to rebut his own arguments. In my opponent's first contention, he is still denying the difference between a rock and a human without ever addressing the animate mode of response directly. It's denial to ignore the options causality presents animate beings. My example of the single-celled organism makes this point clear. The ""Argument from Neuroscience"" is completely speculative at this stage and deals with brain activity, not consciousness and free will. My opponent's appeal to science is without evidential merit. My opponent's ""Argument from the Universe"" continues to deny the difference between a rock and a human. The advent of life introduced new phenomena to the universe that clearly delineate the animate from the inanimate. Denial is not a strategy. In the ""Determinism and Free Will Are Mutually Exclusive"" argument, my opponent is quote mining again. I explained determinism, under the ""Determinism – Logical Conclusions"" heading, for the benefit of defining my terms – NOT because it's my position or belief. Final Words: My opponent believes that denial is some sort of strategy. He has failed to address the animate mode of response. I challenge him to explain how humans and rocks are causally identical."	PRO	916
S28feca15-A5fe3cb35	Free Will is Real and Compatible with Determinism	"=RESPONSE TO OPPONENT My opponent claims that it is philosophy, not science, that should answer the question before us. Perhaps true a millenium ago, but not true in a world where we have abundant evidence that all macro-world processes are deterministic. Not in a world where we've studied the human decision-making process scientifically, and we have only confirmed the fact that things work deterministically therein. The quantum world is the only thing for which there is a significant amount of scientific uncertainty regarding whether or not it is deterministic, and that is a thing that has nothing to do with our decision making process. My opponent brings up issues with some of the things I said last round. I'll address those now. =FIRST SET OF 3 #1. I claimed that my opponent was implying that the ability to calculate things (assuming a omniscient calculator) in a deterministic world was somehow evidence against it. My opponent says I am wrong. My bad, I was reading with the assumption that my opponent would be trying to affirm the resolution, so I must have read that into it. Now that my opponent has recognized it has no bearing on the truth or falsehood of the resolution: #2. Again, I was assuming that my opponent was making a point for his resolution, rather than pointing out an irrelevant bit of data. Now that I know we agree that the possibility of randomness in the quantum world has no effect on how likely free will is to exist: #3. My opponent claims this was an appeal to reason. Here's the ""appeal to reason"" in question quoted directly from his R1: ""With absolute determinism, we don't have the slightest chance of exerting any influence on our own lives. We are at the mercy of destiny. Not as appealing as creating your own destiny . . . but better than no destiny at all."" That's not an appeal to reason."" That's not as appealing as creating your own destiny"" is about the most blatant appeal to wishful thinking I've ever seen. I'll get to the ""evidence of experience"" in the next point. =SECOND SET OF THREE #1. My opponent says that the ""animate mode of response"" (the nondeterministic mode of response) is obvious, but he ""humors"" me with an example he thinks proves him right. It doesn't. His example is that two identical twins but beside each other in a field will not act the same. This is true, because the identical twins are not completely identical (they have different memories, different positions in space, etc.). My opponent's example fails. #2. My opponent briefly insults me for not recognizing his argument: ""animate mode of response."" Too bad that's not an argument, it's a baseless assertion. My opponent has not shown that living beings determine their actions in nondeterministic ways. He has merely asserted it. #3. Now my opponent decides to give us what he calls evidence for free will, for his ""animate mode of response."" At least he admits that before this point, he simply assumed we all agreed with him already rather than expecting an actual argument. My opponent claims that the processes of learning and planning can't be deterministic. False. And my opponent does only that - he merely claims that it is non-deterministic rather than proving it in any meaningful way. Here's an example of the deterministic nature of learning: Let's say Bob is a novice driver. It's snowy and icy, but he decides to drive to his friend's house anyway. In his parking lot, he loses control of his car and nearly hits a nearby car. He then adapts his plan accordingly - he decides not to go out at the moment. He reads a web page on how to drive well in icy conditions without losing control of the car. Later, Bob decides that he can manage to get to his friend's house, even though the weather isn't any better. He gets in his car, and he makes a different decision on how to drive than he did originally. He manages to get to his friend's house without losing control. Now, we have examples of planning and of learning in the example above. I will explain how they fit into a deterministic worldview. Bob originally decides to go to his friend's house, but once he loses control, he changes his mind. His senses feed his mind the information that he has lost control of the vehicle, and with this new information, he comes to a different conclusion. Determinism only says that an identical brain (identical in what information it has within it, all other aspects of its state etc) will make an identical decision in an identical situation. With new information, the brain is in a different state, and thus decides to make a different decision. Anyway, he then decides to read up on how to drive in this weather. With this new insight, he later decides to go back out to his friend's house. He once again changes his plan because he has new information, not because he's some unpredictable free-willed agent. Again, he gets in the car, but makes a different decision on how to drive than he did before - this is once again due to having new information. The outcome ends up different than the last time because of this. Lastly, my opponent says that the fact that we act as if we have free will is evidence for free will. I will be generous and say that the way in which we act is how we'd expect whether free will is right or determinism is right. Thus, it lends no additional credibility to either of these opposed ideas (by my opponent's definitions, they are opposed). =LONE ONE #1. My opponent misunderstands me. I was saying that the Copenhagen interpretation is unproven, and that some other interpretations, such as a hidden variable theory, are just as likely. My opponent responds by assuming that I'm ignorant of all sorts of quantum ideas. I can only conclude that he has misunderstood me. The fact is that it matters not. Copenhagen interpretation may very well be true, and it would lend no additional credibility to my opponent's argument. So for the purposes of this debate, we'll say the Copenhagen interpretation is true and that quantum mechanics is nondeterministic. It really has absolutely nothing to do with whether free will or deterministic laws govern the decision-making process. =MY CONTENTIONS My opponent hardly addresses these, claiming that I've ""made"" him waste so much time with other things. My first contention goes unanswered - my opponent simply claims again that the ""animate mode of response"" rebuts my argument. My opponent is wholly unable to show how it is even possible that certain atoms, based on simply having a certain arrangement, become immune from the laws of physics. Such a thing would shatter physics as we know it. My opponent also refers to ""his example of the single-celled organism"" - an unsourced claim for which my opponent has given absolutely no evidence. If single-celled organisms have been shown to have ""free will"" in the sense we are using the term, I challenge my opponent to provide a reliable source that shows this. My second contention, neuroscience, shows that the decision-making process happens in the chemically-driven brain. My opponent has no response for this, so he simply asserts that consciousness and free will are not a product of the brain. My third contention, the universe, and how deterministic events and objects that follow deterministic laws can assemble in a way that somehow becomes non-deterministic. My opponent gives no answer, he merely says I am ignoring the difference between rocks and people. Rocks and computers also react in very different ways to events, but that does not mean only one of them reacts based on deterministic science. Lastly, the incompatibility of determinism as my opponent has defined it and free will as he has defined it. My opponent affirms that he was actually defining terms. Since he defined the terms, those definitions conflict, and the resolution says they don't, the resolution is negated. I look forward to my opponent's final round."	CON	917
S28feca15-A107b95db	Free Will is Real and Compatible with Determinism	"My opponent jumps right into the fray with an intentional, flat-out, self-serving misrepresentation. And I quote: ""My opponent claims that it is philosophy, not science, that should answer the question before us."" My opponent continues, unrelenting, in his dishonest tactics. What I actually said is a matter of record: ""Free will was, traditionally, a philosophical question, although science has begun pursuing the question more vigorously since the development of modern scanning technologies."" My opponent may feel it's insulting to be called out for dishonest tactics, but I say it's not an insult if it's deserved. It appears that it's my opponents strategy to swamp me with Sock Puppet fallacies and outright misrepresentations of my words so that I'll have little room left to address his own arguments. I'm not going to make the same mistake twice (because I have free will), so I will leave it to the intelligence of the reader to spot my opponent's spin control . . . unless the transgression is particularly onerous. Then I'll defend myself. As for science, absolute determinism and the macro world, causality rules the inanimate universe and greatly influences animate beings . . . but my opponent's claim that it's ALL deterministic is not the truth: it's dogma. Here's why. Logically, what can be said of everything can be said of nothing. It's scientifically meaningless because it's NOT FALSIFIABLE. This is one major reason why absolute determinism is merely an opinion -- NOT a fact. My opponent is advancing the same old, worn out, determinist dogma: ""Causality predetermines all events -- even our acts and thoughts."" Based on this simplistic interpretation of causality, determinists then assert that the experience of choice, and therefore free will, is an illusion. Aside from illustrating that ""what can be said of everything can be said of nothing"", that argument is also recursive reasoning. It's circular logic that begs the question by paraphrasing it's conclusion as its premise -- ""Our acts and thoughts are (i.e. ""Everything is"") predetermined, therefore our acts and thoughts are (i.e. ""everything is"") beyond our control."" By denying the difference between a rock and a person, absolute determinism sets itself up as a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose farce. Determinism is fine with me as long as it accommodates all facts: ABSOLUTE determinism is dogmatic and false. I've become convinced that absolute determinism is a surrogate religion for far too many people. It's a closed system, replete with all the trappings of religion: unfalsifiability, ""cherry-picking"", dogma, denial, fatalism, vehemently closed minds, appeals to authority and recursive reasoning. Oh yeah, and determinists get to keep their Prime Mover and absolution from responsibility too. I just can't understand what motivates determinists to deny the empirical evidence of their experience, not to mention the empowerment of free will, in favor of a worldview of unfalsifiable claims and debilitating fatalism. It seems to me that, if determinists really believed what they claim, they'd be the laziest, least motivated and most venal people on Earth. Which leads me to believe that many philosophical determinists must be rebels and simply enjoy going against the grain. It's cool, man! I notice that whenever my opponent uses phrases like: ""my opponent was implying""; ""my opponent has recognized""; ""my opponent claims""; ""he simply assumed""; etc., spin control is usually at work. Compare his claims to mine and spare me some pixels for more arguments. This next example makes me wonder if, perhaps, my opponent's level of discernment is lower than I thought and the accusation of dishonest tactics was giving him too much credit. He seriously proposes that I claimed single-celled organisms have free will. Does anybody else think that? If so, then reread what I wrote. I said that: ""The advent of life introduced motility to the universe. Motility is simply the ability to move without the influence of an external force. Even single-celled organisms can move to avoid harsh or noxious conditions. The significant difference is that the movement is NOT 100% predictable. Unlike inanimate objects, there is more than just one direction the organism can take. Nor will identical organisms move identically under identical conditions. This is an undeniable departure from the precisely predictable reactions of inanimate matter."" So, is it my opponent's level of discernment or his dishonesty that would twist motility into free will? Once again, it's not an insult if it's deserved. I was thrilled to face an 11-0 master debater but now find myself fending off arguments such as these. I'm disappointed with my opponent and the position I find myself in. In case my opponent has managed to confuse any readers, I will end with a summary of my position. Final Summary: The main claim determinists make is a dogma -- ""Causality predetermines all events -- even our acts and thoughts."" It's scientifically unfalsifiable because it admits no exceptions: what can be said of everything can be said of nothing. Additionally, it's also a logical fallacy known as ""Begging the question"". Begging the question is recursive, circular, reasoning that paraphrases it's premise as its conclusion. But a dogma might still be true. Is absolute determinism true? Not as long as it makes no distinction between inanimate and animate modes of response to causality. If you look up ""causality"" in Wikipedia, you'll find that it takes many forms and that the animate/inanimate boundary separates the ""causal realms"" of biology and physics: ""The Fountain Theory of Realms of Science, part of the philosophy of science, says that the laws of physics describe cause and effect within physics, and can be seen as the underlying causes of biological events, but that the causal connections between the realms of physics and biology are rarely observed directly, and thus are not a major part of either science."" As this Wikipedia article illustrates, causality, and thus determinism, is NOT absolute in the sense that animate beings can't have a different mode of response than do inanimate objects. In fact, it's this difference in mode of response that separates physics from biology. Physics deals with the inanimate realm and biology deals with the animate realm. As a lay person, my opponent might not understand what all scientists know: laws are not laid down once and for all, and especially not to dictate what we can or cannot think. They are tools for helping us think; and most of all, to be transcended if necessary. It's not reality that might be wrong, it's our interpretation that might need adjusting. Those who believe causality and determinism can't accommodate the differences between inanimate objects and inanimate beings need to adjust their interpretation to accommodate the facts. Absolute determinism puts artificial constraints on causality. Because the advent of life introduced radically new kinds of objects (animate beings) to the universe -- objects that move without external force and even, in the case of humans, can extrapolate causality into the future to keep one step ahead of it -- a new mode of response to causality came along with life. Causality was no longer limited to single, fixed, reactions to actions. With intelligent life, causality causes a variable range of potential reactions, from which we make our choices. Our intelligence includes the ability to extrapolate causality into the future and make decisions (and adjustments to decisions) that can keep us one step ahead of causality. Examples of human intelligence anticipating and exploiting causality for our own purposes include: sails, umbrellas, sunscreen, television, computers, sports, and just about any human invention or planned activity you can think of. When causality meets intelligence, determinism becomes self-determinism. That's what"	PRO	918

He died for you while you were still a rebell, and He rose from the grave so you could be forgiven by Him and He remains just in that He executed your death upon Himself.

Evolution is actually a religion in which it is beleived man will evolve into gods, and the most powerful and most devloped man will be god of the gods. God the Creator of Man who died to be the Saviour of Man will not permit man to replace HIm. He stopped man from doing this at the Tower of Babel, and He will stop man again before man destroys the world while fighting over who is the fittest to survive so they can evolve. God is still waiting for at least one more person to be conceived, or one more person to believe on and receive Jesus Christ as their Saviour to be spared from the wrath to come.....but than maybe he's not.

According to [www.livescience.com]. a very reliable scientific site, a theory is defined as, ""A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next step—known as a theory—in the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon."" [http://www.livescience.com...]. Therefore, according to Christian, atheist, or other kinds of scientists, a theory is proven fact supported by multiple tests. The next part, that God(s) is all around us, in the cells of our bodies and molecules of the nearby air, I believe you are sorely mistaken. If God were able to control every part of our being, as he should be, being an omnipotent being and in the air molecules surrounding us, why would the miracle bringer Jesus be killed and tortured when he had proven himself to God that he was completely devout to him? Surely he would stop the prosecutors of Jesus and punish them as he had punished others? Yet he did not. For my final words, Pro, it may seem very ludicrous for our argument, but I would like you to solve the Omnipotent Paradox, stated by Wikipedia as ""If a being can perform any action, then it should be able to create a task which this being is unable to perform; hence, this being cannot perform all actions. Yet, on the other hand, if this being cannot create a task that it is unable to perform, then there exists something it cannot do."" Thank you for a very nice debate, you made several convincing arguments, however I am still strong in my belief that there is no God(s)."	CON	932

Sd3b36db4-Aaa31a25d	Homosexuality is a sin and if one continues in the sin, then it will sadly lead that person to hell.	I thank my opponent for the valiant attempt he has made to counter the points I made. Nevertheless, despite his efforts, I do not think that he comes remotely close, either to demonstrating that god exists, or that the Bible is his message to mankind, and I shall be explaining why in just a moment. Let me start however by saying that while my opponent is perfectly correct in his assumption that I am an atheist, he is not correct in his assumption that I have actually conceded that the Bible itself teaches that homosexuality is a sin. It is debatable as to whether or not the Bible teaches this - hence why many Christians disagree about it [1] - and I could, if I chose, make an argument attacking my opponent's resolution on those lines. I choose not to do so however, because I think it far simpler to show that the Bible cannot be considered to be the inspired work of a divine being - and once that is shown, who cares what it says! So let's start with the issue of whether or not a god actually exists. The cosmological argument that my opponent presents is little more than an argument from ignorance. It is not a self-evident truth that nothing produces nothing; at the quantum level, particles are popping in and out of existence all the time, with no discernible cause or reason at all. [2] My opponent quotes the Christian theologian Robert Sproul to support his case, and I have to ask him what scientific knowledge the said theologian has that makes his opinions on the origin of the universe remotely authoritative. How does he know that nothing could exist without a self-existent being, and what evidence does he have to support this assertion? I submit that this whole argument is nothing more than unsubstantiated opinion that seeks to insert god as an explanation for things that we simply do not understand yet - something that human beings have been doing all throughout history. Moving on, the teleological argument is countered very easily by the scientific Theory of Evolution and Natural Selection, which provides a convincing and credible explanation for all the apparent design that we see in the universe today - namely (putting it very simply) that it arises out of genetic variation within a population [3], with the result that those creatures whose genes give them an advantage over others (slightly better hearing/eyesight etc) are more likely to reproduce and pass on those genes to the next generation. [4] And so, gradually and slowly over time, due to this process of Natural Selection, living creatures become more adapted to life in their respective environments [5]. The scientific evidence for evolution is overwhelming, and although scientists do disagree over relatively minor details, the basic facts of evolution are no longer in scientific dispute. [6] Most crucially, nowhere is god needed as an explanation to make this process work. Moving on to the moral argument, it is now accepted as self-evident truth by most people today that slavery is a terrible evil, and one that is rightly outlawed. If the moral argument is valid therefore, it surely follows that it is objectively true that slavery is evil, and (if the Bible is the work of the god who exists by the moral argument) that the Bible should therefore condemn it. However, far from condemning it, the Bible explicitly endorses it. Leviticus 25:44-46, which grants the Israelites the right to purchase male and female slaves from the foreigners in their midst is just one example amongst many. For this reason, many religious Americans as late as the 19th century considered slavery to be morally approved by god. [7] And so, I regard the moral argument as an example of what I informally call 'an argument from wishful thinking.' Yes, it would be nice in many ways if objective truth did exist. It would make settling issues a lot easier if we could simply appeal to some unquestionable 'objective truth.' Sadly however, there is no evidence that such a thing even exists, and religious organisations themselves give us absolutely no reason to believe that it does. Incidentally, given that slavery is clearly endorsed by the Bible, yet we now consider it to be wrong, one could just as easily argue that we have no good reason to consider homosexuality wrong, despite the fact that you can find verses in the Bible condemning it. However, I have already explained why I see no need to explicitly construct an argument along these lines. The fundamental point that I do wish to make is that given that we see no evidence of an 'objective morality' within religious institutions, there is no reason to believe that they have any kind of access to any source of 'objective morality.' My opponent goes on to list various properties which he claims demonstrate that the Bible is of divine origin. Property D - scientific foreknowledge - has already been effectively demolished and destroyed by the Theory of Evolution, whose implications flatly contradict the creation story in Genesis. To give one further example, science makes a complete mockery of the story of Noah's ark, since (to give one of many arguments) the ark specified in the Bible would not have been large enough to carry all the animals and food required to repopulate the earth. [8] I can take B and C - the so called eyewitness accounts of the resurrection of Jesus and his miracles - together. We have no idea who wrote the four gospels and why. We therefore have no idea where the writers got their information or whether or not they were even eyewitnesses to the events they describe. [9] Furthermore, the different gospels can't even agree on fundamental details concerning important events such as Jesus' death - did he die confused and despairing, wondering why God had forsaken him, as told by Mark 15:33-34, or did he die knowing that he was fulfilling god's plan and that he was going to paradise, as told by Luke 23:43 - 46. Surely, if the Bible were the inspired work of god, he would have made sure that its message on this vitally important matter was clear and consistent. Finally, I would ask my opponent to provide an example of an Old Testament prophecy which he thinks has been fulfilled. And so, my opponent still has much work to do. He has, I submit, so far completely failed to show that god exists or that the Bible is his message to mankind. He tellingly provides no rational reason whatsoever as to why that god, if he exists, would wish to outlaw homosexuality, relying instead on another argument from ignorance, using god to explain logic in the same way that people used to use god to explain rain, wind and thunder. We as yet have no reason to believe therefore that god even exists, let alone that homosexuality is against his law, and I look forward to my opponent's final response.

Sb42b1da5-A182d8761	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	Thank you for taking me up on this debate. I would like to start this round off by saying that the lack of support by scientific facts, physical, or fossil evidence, does show that the theory is not well supported. That being said, why is it being taught in public schools? Though my opponent is not obligated to answer, since it is not relevant to today's debate, I would like to hear what he thinks about this. My first point was the lack of transitional fossils, and how it pokes a huge hole in the theory. Back when Charles Darwin had created this theory, many doubted it due to the lack of fossil evidence. Though that was a long time ago, we still have yet to find these fossils, since there should be countless millions. An argument that I have heard before to as an answer to this, is that they are buried deep beneath the Earth, and that we have only dug up about .001 percent of the Earth. We should not have to look too far down, as we have found thousands of extinct creatures in this .001 percent. We should have found many transitional fossils by now, and yet we have not. Next, I would like to go over genetics, and how it does not help prove the theory. The complexity of the genetic code is fascinating, and for this to just come about is mathematically impossible. It is said that the mathematical probability of evolution is equivalent to a thousand monkeys given a typewriter, and each typing Shakespeare without a flaw- Impossible. Genes alone also do not prove evolution, as the passing down of traits is JUST the passing down of traits! It does not mean that over time, that trait will be passed down far enough for a monkey to become a human, as some atheists would say (Or fish, amebas- I have heard many different theories and those who believe the theory cannot settle on one common ancestor). Next, I would like to go over the lack of explanation to the big bang theory. Scientist still do not know what was before the big bang. There are theories, the question still remains, as I had stated in my opening statement, what came before that? This, once again, pokes a huge hole in the theory. Also, though on the outside, the big bang theory may seem possible, but once again, the probability is low. If the big bang were to have happened, how did the planets become so spherical? Every planet, star, comet, ext, has a common theme: They are all circular! I do not remember ever hearing about a square planet, star, comet ext, but invite my opponent to tell me about strangely shaped space objects. Lastly, though I did not say that I would go over this in my opening statement, I would like to talk about the Earth's age and how it disproves evolution. Evolution is a theory based off of time, some billions and billions of years. Yet if the Earth were to be proven young, the theory would have no longer have time to justify why it is not happening now. Many facts about human history and discoveries, geology, the magnetic fields and about a HUNDRED more facts that disprove the Earth's current estimated age, say that the Earth may only be tens of thousands of years old. A fact that dates the moon at a younger age than previously expected is moon dust. Before we landed on the moon, we expected it to be a giant dust ball. This is because of the amount of dust that comes down to the Earth. When we landed, it turns out that there were only a few inches of dust, indicating a young moon. This is because if it was older, the amount of dust that would be falling off of the moon per year would basically make the moon a whole lot smaller than it is. Though this is the moon, and not Earth, we would probably know if the moon was younger than the Earth. These facts alone disprove the theory, and there are also many other flaws that can be pointed out in the theory. Charles Darwin knew them, and so did everyone he presented this theory to. I am looking forward to my opponents response to the information that I have presented, and wish him also he best of luck.	PRO	937
Sb42b1da5-A552e501d	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	"As stated, this post is for outlining my argument; and I will rebutt my oponents counter argument in the final round. Evolution, or more accurately the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis, essentially explains that from a universal common ancestor and through the physical mechanisms of reproduction, genetic mutations and the processes of gene flow, natural selection and genetic drift can be used to explain the nature of the planet. [1] I will start to summarise the evidence of this. - The Nested Hierarchy - When arranging life objectively by it's properties, you find a pattern that develops when viewing the physical or ""Morphological"" differences between species. Essentially, a nested hierarchy of properties are found: A tree. [2] You find that for a specific feature, all species that have that feature also have a common set of other features. Animals that have a placenta, have a tetropod skeleton, nipples, are warm blooded, have a spine, a skull, an anus that forms before the mouth, are bilaterally symmetric and have eukaryote cells.[3] Such patterns build up consistently to provide sets of features within features: A tree, with no violations: No mixing and matching of different sets, or ""clades""; no birds with nipples, no fish with placenta, and no mammals that do not have bilateral symmetry. This is evidence of descent with modification.[4] Interpreting the tree of life as a ""family"" tree, implying ancestry is validated by chronology: As you go back in time the fossils will general transition down through the tree progressing to simpler and more common forms. And validated by geography: Fossils relating primarily to a geographically located species should appear in that particular location. Thus far there are a total of 250,000 fossil species discovered (1984) [5], all matching the tree, with a total recorded by Wikipedia of 175 significant transitional forms [6] for almost all branches of life showing the progression of most lineages but not for all species. All of which are consistent with Common Descent. Fossilisation itself requires specific conditions, which are not common[7]; while by no means a complete list of all species that have ever lived, there are significant numbers of both transitional and normal fossils that are more than enough to provide significant evidence for evolution. However, it is not by any means the only proof that is present, merely one part of a cohesive whole that all points to common descent via evolution. -Cytochrome C "" More specifically, upon the discovery of DNA, it was possible to analyse the genetic code to determine the genetic differences. A good example is Cytochrome C, which is a protein that is the same in all species. Some genetic mutations can occur that do not change the coded protein due to how base-pairs code for amino acids work. As a result if common descent were true, these mutations will build up proportionally to the distance inferred from the tree of life. The results of this analysis show that the genetic differences between Cytochrome C on different organisms matches exactly what is predicted by common descent. A number of other genetic markers, such as Endogenous Retro Viruses, and detailed genetic analysis of the human chromosome further support this. [8] -Other demonstrations - On top of this, there are many other aspects, that I must only summarise due to word limitations such as atavisms (human tails or whale legs), Vestigiality; and strange quirks of nature such as the laryngeal nerve in the giraffe that goes from it""s brain, down to it""s heart and back up again; a trait shared in all mammals that offers still more evidence of descent with modification. [8] - Mutations, Natural Selection and Evolution "" To start of with, the genetic basis of Evolution: mutations demonstrate the process, with numerous different types of changes that can occur on the DNA to change, duplicate or remove DNA information. [9] Having such an ability to duplicate, remove and change DNA, it becomes a triviality to explain how the DNA can grow from something simple to something more complex (with more data) when you factor in evolutionary processes. The way evolution works, is by random mutations occurring; and a creature with these mutation either being more or less successful than its competitors. This allows the random mutation to spread over generations; as those that possess such a mutation is at an advantage. While some elements of evolution are random (such as genetic drift), this particular aspect is very much not.[10] Such a process can and has been experimentally verified with the E-Coli experiments, and evolving Algae to become multi-cellular [11][12] - Evolutionary Conclusion "" As a result of the evidence above, we show a clear pattern of evidence providing massive amounts of support for common descent. Together with experimental evidence demonstrating evolution, and our analysis of the genetic and statistical processes at work, combined with observed and analysed types of mutations and genetics, it is clear that species are changing and have changed in the past. As we have thus far found no mechanism or process that will stop mutations from accumulating, it is clear that the species will continue to change, adapt, vary and accumulate changes until a collection of small changes yield a massive change in long lost descendants compared to an originating ancestor. This genetic evidence demonstrates significant macro evolution is not only possible, but there is significant and extensive evidence that shows that it is the process explains the biodiversity of all life with no compelling evidence otherwise. As such, the results are clearly conclusive that evolution is not a flawed theory. - The Big Bang "" The big bang theory is the theory that the states that the universe was initially very small and very dense, and began expanding[13]. The evidence for this comes from the observation that the galaxies are moving apart, the cosmic background radiation and the abundance of particular types of atoms (the last two are actually predictions of the theory) [14]. This is by no means a complete model, as we simply do not yet have the comprehensive physics and associated mathematics to describe the point of origin and the specific processes involved. But nevertheless, the observational evidence of the CMB shows that the universe was very small and very close together. -Where did it all come from? "" This question is philosophical in nature. It is not scientific. Science is primarily about the HOW: how things do and have worked, with the nature WHY always remaining unanswered. This is less a failure of science, but more concerning the limitations of what science can and cannot do. But, this doesn""t answer the actual question: Where did it all come from? Firstly, to an extent, it is by no means certain that the fundamental statement is valid: It is only the human mind and the fact I find it intuitive that something must have a cause that there should be one. I know that the universe does not work in the way I find intuitive as anyone who has read quantum theory will appreciate. In the latter theory, there is fundamentally no cause of some occurrences: Quantum tunnelling is when atoms move through an otherwise impossible barrier at random. [15] Radioactivity decay occurs using random probability: there is no physical objective cause that makes an atom decay at any given time.[16] As a result, it is fairly clear that there are already aspects of the universe that may not have a physical cause, thus calling into question whether the whole concept of the universe even requires a cause. To some extent, this is really a non-answer, however. Fundamentally, though, neither the religious nor atheists really have any objective facts regarding the cause of the universe. It is simply down to assumptions. Those that believe in a personal God may state that there must be a cause of the universe, therefore the cause is God, while also asserting that God that has always existed, or is somehow timeless and so doesn""t need an explanation of its own existence. From a purely atheistic position, I make this same assumption, that there is some aspect of the universe that always existed, or is somehow timeless that does not need an explanation of its own existence. The difference; it is not possible to infer any more than our statement that the universe requires cause. Positing that a personal deity that takes an interest in the workings and machinations of the universe at a physical level simply adds additional layers of un-provable, untestable assumption that is not directly implied or inferred from the question itself.

Sb42b1da5-A9ba6e01d	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	"I would like to start out by saying that my opponent has done more of explaining evolution to me than providing evidence. -The Nested Hierarchy- The evolutionary tree is flawed, and those such as Darwin Himself saw it and doubted his theory because of it. The flaw is in the Cambrian Explosion. At first, there is creatures with a low amount of cells, the suddenly, a huge jump to organisms like trilobites. This happens throughout the tree, though not as dramatically as in the Cambrian Explosion. Also, I am not sure if you know this yet, but wikipedia is not a very reliable source, as this quote that I am about to show you is from a quote from well known scientist named Colin Paterson, who wrote a book called evolution once said, when asked why he did not include facts about transitional fossils, '""I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic licence, would that not mislead the reader?"" -Other demonstrations- Just because we do not yet know the purpose of certain organs, does not make them vestigial. Organs such as kidneys can be removed without the loss of life, but they are not considered vestigial. You brought up giraffes, though giraffes are evolution's worst nightmare. This is because the giraffe has so many systems that are so perfect, that many scientists admit that the giraffe shows traces of intelligent design. -Mutations, Natural selection and Evolution- Once again, this is improbable.

Sb42b1da5-Ac2a8098f	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	"I would like to start out by saying that I would like to debate against someone who KNOWS their stuff. I don't want those who just say that evolution is right because it happened, like I have been seeing on many debates similar to this topic. My first point is going to be the various flaws in the theory, such as the millions of transitional fossils that we are missing. This is a huge flaw in the theory that many over-look as, ""A minor flaw"". This destroys any argument of ""Fossil evidence"", because we have not found any of these transitional fossils! Where have they gone?!?!?! Next, I would like to tell my opponent, whoever it may be, that genetics does not prove the theory of evolution, it contradicts it. The genetic code is so complex, there is no way that it could have just somehow originated. Please explain to me how it came to be. Lastly, I would like to point out another contradiction in this theory. The lack of an explanation to what happened before the big bang. Science states that something can't come from nothing, and please don't say that how did God come to be, because i'm not trying to prove religion with science. God was always there, and the laws of science do not apply to Him. But, if the big bang were to be true, then what came before it?

Sb42b1da5-Aa362a1ff	God is real, evolution is a flawed theory.	"There is a lack of support by scientific facts, physical or fossil evidence and this shows the theory is not well supported. As mentioned in my previous argument, I believe I have provided significant evidence that is in support of common descent and evolution. This comprises genetic evidence, experimental evidence, fossil evidence and other biological evidence. I believe I have shown that there are many different avenues, all supported by extensive evidence and so therefore I feel that I have rebutted this particular aspect. 2. Why should it be taught in school. I did not have the word count; so have added this to the comments section. 3. Lack of transitional fossils As I described, the 175 significant transitional forms are by no means the only evidence; in fact form only a small part of the objective evidence for evolution. Given that we know the process of fossilization is very rare, not being able to see an extensive fossil record is to be expected. The issue is not the depth, but simply the process required as outlined in my previous source. While you have no opportunity to do so now, I would point out that you have provided no source, or justification as to why we ""must"" see countless millions of fossil species. In terms of your quote by Colin Patterson, I would point out that this quote is taken out of context, later on he says: ""In several animal and plant groups, enough fossils are known to bridge the wide gaps between existing types. In mammals, for example, the gap between horses, asses and zebras (genus Equus) and their closest living relatives, the rhinoceroses and tapirs, is filled by an extensive series of fossils extending back sixty-million years to a small animal, Hyracotherium, which can only be distinguished from the rhinoceros-tapir group by one or two horse-like details of the skull.""[13] As such, the original quote is very much taken out of context, what Patterson is trying to infer is: ""that statements about ancestry and descent are not applicable in the fossil record. Is Archaeopteryx the ancestor of all birds? Perhaps yes, perhaps no: there is no way of answering the question""[13] 4. Complexity of genetic code, Traits don't just get passed down. As I mentioned previously, with the processes of mutation, duplication, changes and removal of gene sequences the length and complexity of the genes can be explained through the process of natural selection. To use your analogy, it is like starting with one sentence, with you able to remove letters or words, duplicate letters or words, and change letters at random. Doing this at random will yield a random words. But if you take your paper, copy it ten times, and then chose the one that looks most like Shakespear; and repeat again and again and again millions and millions of times, you will likely have something that is understandable (although not entirely like the bard). The mutations are random, but the application of selection is not. Passing down of traits in the same way is not random; traits that benefit survival will be MORE likely to be passed down than others; which means what traits are passed down and which are not are very much a non-random process. I would also point out that the theory of evolution does not say, imply or state that humans came from monkeys. At some point in the past, there was an ancestor that had traits that both humans and monkeys share, these had descendants one branch of which acquired more monkey like traits, with the human branch acquiring more apelike and then homonid like properties. Common Descent no more implies humans came from monkeys than you being descended from your great great great grandfather implies that your mother is your third cousin.[4] 5. Scientists do not know what was before the big bang. This is true; but again whether we find out what was before or not; the fundamental question of origins may not even be a valid question. Moreover as I stated in my previous argument, even if we did answer the question, God is no more rational or pertinent than simply assuming that some aspect of the universe, or multi-verse is timeless and infinite. 6. Why are planets and stars spherical. This actually has nothing to do with the big bang. This is actually relating to Gravity; either Newtonian or relativity. The force of gravity pulls matter together. For a collection of liquid or semi-liquid matter such as a molten planet or star, the most optimal configuration is a sphere. The earth itself, however, is not spherical; the gravity of the moon cause tides in the oceans that deform the spherical shape of the earth[2], with the spinning earth causing a bulge at the equator[1]. Further investigation shows that the earth is actually slightly pear shaped with the bottom being slightly ""bulgier"" than the top[1] Also I would point out that many comets are not spherical, the most famous comet: Halley has been photographed and shown to be non-spherical.[3] 7. The earths age. There are innumerable methods of dating the age of the earth. The most common is isotope dating; we know the decay rates of certain elements fairly exactly. The ratio of that element to the elements it can decay into will allow you to calculate the date at which the rock became solid. [5] You can think of each element that is used for dating as a stop watch that ticks at a certain speed; with different radioactive elements ticking at different speeds. Examples of the different types of element that can be used are Uranium-Lead, Samarium-Neodymium, Potassium-argon, Rubidium-strontium, Uranium-thorium as well as non-explicit mechanisms of fission tracking (detecting evidence of radioactivity in crystal).[6] While there are a number of known problems that can occur, such as contamination and leaching, all measurements made using these methods broadly agree, with a very significant majority of all dates aligning as would be expected given the known margins of error.[5] This is like thousands of stop-watches all ticking at different rates all showing broadly similar times. We can inferr whether this radioactive decay rate has changed by looking at the fine structure constant (which must change if decay rates change due to the physical laws of quantum theory) [7] As it doesn't, we can be fairly certain that the decay rates have been constant over time. Moreover, even if the FSC changes, the clocks ticking at different rates would all change by different amounts, making the alignment of results more unlikely. With respect to moon dust, measurements of the rate of dust accumulations have been conclusively shown to be orders of magnitude lower than was shown by Morris, the original proponent of this argument; and with the properly measured values the expected depth of meteoritic dust on the moon would be less than a foot. [8] With respect to geomagnetic dating, I believe you mean the argument used to date the earth based on geomagnetic decay. Unfortunately, this has several issues: firstly it assumes that the magnetic pole simply decays over time (for which there is compelling evidence to show otherwise such as magnetic pole reversal)[8] Moreover, many other dating methods all conclusively show the age of the earth to be longer than a few thousand years. For example: Dendrochronology allows us to use recreate tree rings up to 11,000 years.[9] Thermolumniscence that allows us to reach up to hundreds of thousands of years. [10] Amino Acid dating can allow us to get up to 10my dates [11] Distant starlight, erosion, Geomagnetic reversals, helioseismology, Human Y chromosomal ancestry, ice layering, impact craters, iron-manganese nodule growth, lack of DNA in fossils, length of pre-historic data/ lunar retreat, Naica megacyrstals, Nitrogen impurities in natural diamonds, oxidizable carbon ratio dating, rock varnish and stalactites ALL demonstrate a minimum age of the earth that is greater than 10,000 years. [12] These dating methods (although some are just process that we know take a long time) are all used in conjunction with one another, with no single method being used exclusively to date an unknown rock, or other object. 8. God is true. While I will not add any additional arguments, as I initially stated that I would only rebut in this round and as such as I am the last poster, this would not be fair, I would like to point that the half the premise of this debate, that God is True has not been demonstrated by my opponent. 9. Summary To summarise this debate from the side of Con, I believe that given the original terms of the debate (to which I presume my opponent has agreed), I have shown that evolution is well supported by the evidence; that the Big Bang theory is a reasonable explanation of the origin of the universe, with the atheistic explanation of the origins of the universe being more rational and including fewer un-provable assumptions than invoking God. Moreover, I feel I have fully and comprehensively addressed all of my opponents issues with evolution, the philosophical explanation of the origin of life. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org...

S67121bf1-A5efb79dd	Religion Science and Philosophy should not be separated, they all point to a common and real truth.	"Well that is a lot more then I expected to respond to, but suppose I will haft to rise to the occasion. First of all I'm not nearly as smart as you so bear with me. I didn't mean religion in the way you used it I'm afraid. When I said religion I did in no way mean that all religions were true or agreed. I meant religion as in the constant struggle to find the true religion and studie it to find the answers to the big questions in life. If that makes sense, not to say that all religion is one but rather to use the word as another area of study like science and Philosophy. The picture I am trying to paint is this. Science is what is true philosophy is looking for what is true, like you said, but science is also looking for truth. In fact science as of late has crossed the boundary into religion with the theory of evolution. Evolution disagrees with the concept of God and a creator. You see science in its pursuit of finding the origins of life has started stepping on religions feet. And philosophy is also trying to find the answer to it all. Like 3 runners in a race, the problem is that the runners are not running in the same direction and really shouldn't be competing but rather helping each other to make it to there goal. Religion, in this case I'm saying Christianity, thinks they have the answer. But in order to prove it they need science and philosophy. But people seem to insist that if you believe in science that you cant possibly be religious. Almost like there both true. Do you see what I'm getting at? Either the science is wrong or the religion is wrong, people cant go around saying that one dose not apply to the other. In fact they need each other to really make headway. You cant just say that ""its science"" as if it being somewhat scientific means it must be true and somehow trumps religion. Ill be honest I'm on Gods side here, its just ridicules to me that some people say ""I believe in science"" and others ""I believe in religion"" as if because you believe in one the other doesn't apply anymore. When they both need to agree in order to make progress, I'm not saying you should mix evolution and Christianity, I don't believe in evolution for the record. But you cannot say that in science there is no God. Because he's the God of science as well as philosophy or he is not God. And science philosophy and everything points to him. they haft to because god is the source. Why cant science express ideas that are somewhat religious by looking at creation, or philosophical? And why can't religion express ideas that seem scientific? And really all pursuits of knowledge should be heading toward the sores of all knowledge, which is God. But we all insist on going our own way instead of focusing on what really matters. Just like men I guess. And when I talked about people thinking of truth as relative I didn't really mean any specific truth at that time. What I meant is that people tend to think of evolution being true for science and religion having its own truth. Which of cores would mean that real truth doesn't exist. ""truth"" itself not any specific truth. But I think you and I both believe in truth. Really I don't care about winning any stupid debate. What matter to me is, can you see where I'm coming from?

I request a single rule, no forfeits. I hope you will agree. Religious texts other than the Bible have the same claim, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and Zoroastrianism to name a few. By what logical rational does the Bible alone deem Christianity the only word of God and the only truth? If the Bible and Christianity were the single true religion wouldn't it be universal in practice? The Bible and Christianity as your own ""Personal Truth"", in a metaphysical sense, and those of like faith are to be respected. But it is incorrect to cast a net that lessens the validity of the faith and personal truths of those of other religions. Not being god and all knowing, no one or faith can claim with full certainly their beliefs and practices are factually correct. All religions were created by man. As is taught in most faiths, man is flawed in mind and spirit. All religions are based in faith. Faith is intangible and abstract and can't be proved. If Pro chooses to provide in rebuttal a litany of Biblical verses; it will not be sufficient to make a case that the Bible and Christianity is the factually true religion in equal measure as the earth is round, or 2+2=4 in lieu of other religions.

Sf0e230dd-Accf1a804	Overall Life will be more Happy if you Accept some kind of Higher Being is real	I will arguing for why you shouldn't accept a higher being for meaning because it does not make you happy. 1. There is no evidence for such a being. Since believing in God almost always means you subscribe to a specific doctrine. You are susceptible of learning bad ideas. Lets take Christianity. No where in its holy book does it state that they are against human property or slaves. It was congress who freed the slaves and the civil war. Not the Bible because it does not condemn slavery. Were the slaves happy being slaves? 2. Genital mutilation Almost every single male child would go through this and some female children in Christianity. The child is being harmed in the process and during that time the childs reactions to anything that it does not understand would be crying. Now put the child into a situation where it will be painful. Now you allowing your personal beliefs to harm your child. There is no health reasons for having your genitals mutilated so basically it is about belief by that every single Christian child would go through this if there parents forced it upon them not because it is right. Were children happy having their genitals mutilated? 3. Lets take the most happy inducing thing I can think of. Sex. Is the Nun happy not having sex since she took a vow to say she wouldn't? 4. I think everyone goes to a phase of what am I going to with your life? The problem I have is that actually finding meaning in life do not have false hope on a God which you have to take a leap of faith until you die. By that if you were wrong about the existence of your God you have wasted all your life trying to please It. What I would say is find something real like a significant other or friends. Realise the worst can happen to them and the time they are alive you hopefully enjoy each others company. Another way to find meaning is through work. . To do this simply find what you like and do it. Doing this instead of having a really tedious desk job you can have a not so tedious job that you like. I have pointed 2 ways you can find meaning without God which is tangible happiness not a lie. I don't think I am meant to be rebutting in this Round so I will wait until the next Round.	CON	955
Sf0e230dd-Af1719a15	Overall Life will be more Happy if you Accept some kind of Higher Being is real	"Let us remember this is no debate over the existence of a higher being merely a debate over if the belief in one is beneficial to ones happiness. For myself I believe in a God but I subscribe to no single religion to believe in a higher being you do not need to only follow a specific doctrine. Simply because the Bible does not discuss the issue of slavery is simply irrelevant to most who strictly follow it as ""God's word"" as for those who follow the bible to each letter find that it brings answers for them in certain moral questions and while the Bible brings wrongful answers to some such as it's harshness against homosexuals people feel they do not have to debate with themselves about what is right or wrong all they must do is follow the Bible and that for some people makes them more happy. Again my opponent discusses the specifics of Christianity and it's own faults but believing a higher spirit for the majority of Christians let's does not involve genital mutilation for most it's a simple trip every Sunday to their local church not a strict life lives by the church and this weekly ability to feel forgiven for the wrongdoings of a week is of great comfort to many. Aspirations still exist with God and it's a basic human quality to know that if they feel as if they are being watched in every action one commits they will most likely think twice about doing something that would be frowned upon in public. For many God has tangible ways of happiness, Nature for one and especially myself is a thing of such beauty that I only believe to be created by a genius being, When life gives tough decisions, Stresses and those leaving us on Earth like grandparents, Parents, Siblings to be able to believe that they are now resting in heaven where I will reunite with them upon death brings me real happiness. Life should not be spent trying to please a God I agree with my opponent on that but for those who's faith is unwavering and they wish to spread God's word let them for they think it is one of joy and happiness and for those who listen I say let them for they find comfort in knowing their always someone to turn to in times of crisis. Everyone should recognize that to be happy in life they need friends, A good job and a lifelong companion of sorts but like everything on this planet all of these come and go so to have one constant in life for your entire life, A God that you know is always their for you does bring more happiness."

Pro's standard of what constitutes ""good"" and ""better"" is completely baseless. There is no rule written in the sky that God would have to conform to that standard in making his judgments. As mortals with limited knowledge, we have no way of fathoming what an all-powerful, all-knowing being would do. Pro's case is fundamentally flawed in that it attempts to ascertain what God would do without any knowledge of what God's personality or goals are; instead, he fallaciously assumes that God would share his subjective values and builds his entire case off of that.

Scenario A is clearly a better scenario not just in the interests of God wishing to be close to his children and the desire for the purity of his children. This would also end all suffering and would ensure everyone has the same knowledge about God ultimately unifying everyone around the world around this undeniable truth. Scenario B Lacks any clear purpose of God or at least doesn't define the purposes of god by Bible definitions.

It so drastically favors the aff to begin with, that it is ridiculous for he/she to say ""This is unfair because he's abusing how right he is!"" while they made the resolution themselves. God, according to Christian texts, is all powerful, and can do whatever he wants. This means he has no reliance on Satan for anything. Before the snake was created and Adam met it, there was no problem at all with Good vs Evil. It is the existence of the snake that is the problem and creates evil. If you remove the snake, as it was in the early days of the existence of man, which is entirely possible because it was once the status quo, then there is no evil. God doesn't depend on anyone. I argue that to be good is not in fact to be absent of evil, but to be good is to be the status quo in a world without Satan. There is no evil, there is only the status quo, which is above all the only way to be. It is not restrained by petty concepts of ""good"" and ""evil"", but simply its there, following the greatness of ""God"", which assumes it is better than good.

Pro has chosen not to debate the actual points, but rather cites blind faith as the basis for his claims. He is calling for voters to make their decision based upon his insistence of what is ""right"" instead of via the actual process and skill that actual debate entails. For this reason, you must consider me victorious as far as this debate is concerned. Being as though I'm an atheist (and Pro has not made one original or compelling argument), I'm not scared about winning elsewhere (i.e. in the eyes of god :P ). We'll see where this goes form here.

Besides, what if your life is just a dream and everyone you meet is just the embodiment of aspects of yourself? For all you know, every conversation with every person you've ever met could actually be a conversation with yourself.

Sdb3cf1de-A382a056c	The reason YOU cannot disprove solipsism is because your NOT REAL!!!!	"I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge, I was starting to think nobody would!!! First off, I have to say I'm truly heartbroken to hear about your difficult situation. I can't pretend to know your situation or think that I can help, sadly all I can offer is perspective. I was 16yrs old once (a loooong time ago), I dreaded every moment I was awake, and sleep only offered nightmares. I guess it would be shallow of me to consider your grief to be typical teenage growing pains, but I was a deeply troubled teenager. I remember one day I decided to end my life. I gave away some of my things, I didn't consider anything to be a valuable to me any longer. It was like a great weight was taken off my shoulder now that I no longer would suffer life. Strange though, I became happy, I was even ecstatic at the thought of dying. How does this make sense, I thought. I decided to die because I thought I was suffering, but that choice brought me happiness. If I'm still capable of such happiness, maybe I should let my life play out and see what it may still have in store for me. It took a while for me to realize that my additude toward life affects how I feel about life. Not to say that if you have a good additude toward life it will rid you of traumatic situations, sadly those things are circumstantial. Buddha teaches that if we didn't have bad situations or people who make us miserable in our lives, we couldn't truly appreciate the happiness we experience (I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a direct quote). If all our lives were filled with everything we could ever want without difficulty or unhappiness, then the happiness would no longer make us happy, it would become mundane and it would be difficult to want to continue living, we would no longer be able to achieve happiness, only redundancy. We need unhappiness and difficulty to help us appreciate the beauty and happiness we sometimes have. Oddly enough, my preachy rant does fit into my argument. Solipsism is a radical philosophical extension of idealism. Idealism is in opposition to materialism. Some forms of idealism basically say that our beliefs and additudes actually effect our universe, even in a physical manner. https://www.popularmechanics.com.... It sadens me to see so many people give into the evils of nihilism when even as we speak, science and technology and philosophy are revealing that we have more influence over our universe then we ever dreamed we could. Nihilism is the prevailing additude today. Why? I don't know. I know that I may sound like an idealistic lunatic who's detached from reality when I go on my ""additude effects our lives"" rants. I know that a good additude and a smile isn't going to stop a broken child from storming into his school with a gun and committing such useless carnage without reason. Another thing I do know is that those types of acts are done by individuals who think life is useless or meaningless, they don't do it oit of love, all they know is nihilism. I've been there, and after awhile I became sick and tired of being sick and tired. The only true way I can find to combat the decadence is to arm myself with a better additude toward life and others. I don't believe in decadence, and I discredit nihilism."	PRO	981

Sfd336fc2-Abcf44a25	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	"Sorry Daley, I'm new here and not very good at debating yet. I didn't want you to argue this with me unless you agreed that God created us to understand life. I am not arguing here for a fully Buddhist or Hindu or Sikh or Jain view of Samsara because I am using my own simplified and modified Samsaric (Samsara-based) model, and I do not assert that for God to put the souls that he creates through samsara, he has to split his consciousness. In fact, I would argue that it is impossible for an all-encompassing consciousness to split himself to pieces such that nothing left remains all-encompassing and outside of personal existence. So even with souls that are of the Divine Substance realizing God's Law through Samsara, there is still consciousness that remains in the ""Absolute"" position, which, for the purposes of this argument, remains the personal deity in its entirety. You can subtract any amount of consciousness from an infinite god and split it off into individuals, and the infinite god will not have lost anything. However, experience of Life (which he could not have had in the Absolute position) when the souls come back to him. And they will if you give them an infinite amount of time, just like how if you give this universe an infinite amount of time to run down, it will certainly reach heat death eventually. All I'm trying to say, Daley, is that God forgives, in principle. The Soul is not Hitler. The soul is here to understand, that's it. God sent the soul down here to Samsara to understand and until it does, it will not go back to God. What kind of fucked up pagan deity are you worshipping that creates ugly people to suffer forever? Why does he do that? for fun?"	PRO	983
Sfd336fc2-Afdeac7da	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	Christians claim that God created Man so that there would be someone to become aware of and to share in His infinite glory. I argue that if that's the case, the Christian god has designed the afterlife extremely poorly from a teleological standpoint; by sending everyone to either a realm of eternal bliss or eternal suffering, he has foiled his own plans. Instead, he should have used the Samsaric model of existence because it is infinitely more just and because it would have been infinitely more reliable as a mechanism for fulfilling the potential he created in Man.

Sfd336fc2-Adb9895fe	Samsara would suit a just, loving god's purposes better than Heaven and Hell.	"I would like Pro to clarify for us which samsaric model he is proposing. Is he advocating that God should have used a carbon copy of the Hindu model as found in the Vdic writings, that of the Sikhism, Bhuddism, or an adjusted model of his own? If he is making any adjustment, for example, to what the Buddhists teach, what are these adjustments? Further, when you say ""God should have used"" a samsaric model, are you proposing that the Christian God use this method, or are you using a different definition of God? Do you think this samsaric model could be used by the Christian God if indeed he does exist? do hope these matters will be clarified early in this debate so I can properly address what you mean."

S1345519b-A39aa5073	A gigantic, transparent bubble should be placed over the entirety of Canada	I appreciate my opponent's initiative in making up his own ideas. All ideas are welcome to solve this issue; however, the Canadian bubble is by far the best solution. I will respond to my opponent in turn: Invade Canada Unfortunately, and invasion of Canada is not a good or even prudent idea. Canada is very big, and not in a good way. Most of it is barren, snowy wasteland, which is absolutely worthless even to the Canadians because 90% of them live within driving distance of the US border. What good is living space if the living space is crap? That's why Hitler didn't invade Iceland - nobody really wants to live in Iceland, because of all the ice! The bubble is superior to invasion for several reasons - for one, it traps the Canadians into the hell they have created. That is a fate worse than death - being forced to live with the anti-Christ and all of their bad singers. Giant robots My opponent appears to misunderstand what 'bubble' means; I apologize for not clarifying this earlier, but the 'bubble' is not a literal bubble. Think of it as like the bubbles that surround the Gungan underwater city, if those bubbles were reverse engineered to keep certain things (like Jar Jar Binks) in or out. Such a bubble would clearly be strong, because many monsters live underwater.[1] Giant robots are nice, but you would have to build a whole lot of them to cover the entire border (all 5,255 miles of it).[2] Assuming we have one robot for every ten miles, that would require 525 giant robots, which doesn't even cover martime areas.[3] Additionally, giant robots have a propensity to turn on humanity, meaning they could join Canada. No bubble has ever been recorded as having turned on humanity. Giant black box North Korea spouts propoganda across the DMZ all the time, but I haven't seen any stories of South Koreans becoming convinced and defecting to North Korea. References: 1.

We can exploit the bibles obvious fallacies, redundancies, and scientifically disproven sections to disprove the validity of the bible, and with it, the claims of a god's existance. For example, if the bible is the product of an omniscient, wise god, you can counter this statement with the fact that the bible is extremely flawed, promotes slavery, lust, genocide E.T.C., and pushes absurd notions forward about the history of mankind, from evolution to the creation of the universe.

There was also a study done in 2010 that found that used 103 young adults to solve a frustration task in groups, with some playing video games and some not. They found ""that the games had no impact on aggressive behavior whatsoever, and that the group which played no game at all was the most aggressive after the task, whereas the group that played the violent games were the least hostile and depressed"" (2).
