S2c51f919-A9b7682ba	Humans possess free-will	I'll argue that humans are incapable, by logical deduction, of possessing the meta-physical quality known as 'free-will'. Definitions to be used for this argument and to be agreed upon are as follows: Free-will - a characteristic of a sentient being marked by the ability to influence and decide their own actions, in accordance to their will. In other words, an agent's will has the ability to exercise control in determining the outcome of multiple possible futures. External Coercion - Any force that isn't directly a function or consequence of the agent's own consciousness. This includes sub-conscious, involuntary reactions in addition to forces outside of the human brain, such as weather events or other agents. To win, I would have to explain by rational deduction that it is impossible for such a thing to manifest in an agent. For the opponent to win, they would need to demonstrate or deduce that it is merely possible for free-will to exist, though if they are up to the extra challenge they might go as far as demonstrating that it *does* exist. First round for acceptance? Thank you in advance for whomever takes me on for my first debate here.	CON	1
S2c51f919-A1b394f9a	Humans possess free-will	"Free-will is fundamentally a contradiction; and in demonstrating how, I will show that it can be rationally deduced to non-existence as a meta-physical phenomenon. The only thing that needs hereafter be assumed is the fundamental rule of observed physical laws. But a physical law, in many ways is limited to human understanding and process. The truth is, there are two factions of science that differ in how they describe the movement of time and relationship between matter and time. One theory, under classic physics, suggest there is a single world in the universe, exiting in one perfectly determinable chain of cause and effect. A single, contained, space-time continuum. Each particle in space has only a single possible way it can move through time. A consequence of this model would be that there is no randomness in the movement of matter/energy across time, and all motion is perfectly determined (that is to say, where a particle be in the future is decided from the very beginning of time, a sort of physics equivalent of 'fate'). Then, there is the theory of quantum physics, coupled with its ""indeterminacy"" conclusion. This view of physics differs in that it suggests that on a sub-atomic level, it is demonstrably impossible to predict precisely how a particular particle or wave will behave, but a range of possibilities can be observed. It is commonly deduced that there multiple universes, each splitting off from one another as events occur at the quantum level, where each individual possibility manifests into its own, unique world, mirroring and branching as time passes. To use a common metaphor, each quantum particle is like a dice, in that it has multiple possible faces to land on when tossed. The moment a particle passes to the next unit of time, it's as though it's been thrown, and instead of one face being landed on, all six are, but each in its own separated world. There is one world split off from the previous moment where the dice lands on 1, another branching from the same instant of time where it lands instead on 2, etc. In this way, you can see that it is impossible to know which world we will be 'tossed' into until it happens, there is no way to precisely predict it ahead of time. In this way, the world would not technically operate 'randomly', since each possibility is guaranteed to occur, but in independent worlds. The world you happen to land into isn't 'chance', because you had to be in this world, since you were part of the set of possibilities for each and every one. Better than 'randomly', is the word 'indeterminately', which means it is not possible to know how a particle will behave ahead of time (and thus, which world you will occupy)[1]. One could however imagine a randomness as a possibility. If the quantum indeterminacy remains to be true, but the multiworld theory false, it would follow that particles occupy a single, isolated continuum, or one-world, where in each moment of passing time, each particle expresses itself randomly from a set of possibilities. I. Hard determinism. Determinism is the philosophical meta-physical position that mirrors the classical physics position described above. Determinism states that there is only a single possible future, past and present for all things in the universe. In other words, given enough information, any and all events beyond the present moment could be calculated with absolute precision. A hard determinist believes that while holding to determinism, free-will is not possible. The obvious reasoning is that with only a single, fixed possibility for the future, man may have a will but utterly no freedom. II. Compatibilism. Compatibism is the belief that both determinism and free-will can co-exist. The following is the compatibilist theory as to how this might be [2]: ""the agent had freedom to act according to their own motivation. That is, the agent was not coerced or restrained. Arthur Schopenhauer famously said ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."" As much as I professedly admire Schopenhauer, this is one of those instances where he committed a grave and egregious error. The obvious flaw in this logic is directly admitted, ""man cannot will what he wills"", meaning he is not 'free' to choose the thing that binds his decisions. Stating that we are unable to choose our will is the most blatant, express admission that will is not free I've ever heard from an argument that supposedly supports the same very thing. III. Indeterminism. Its been established quite plainly and obvious how man lacks free-will in the classic-physics model of determinacy, but what of the radical new revolution quantum physics has to offer on the subject? Surely, being that we widely believe the world to be, on some scale, 'indeterminable', that means we have free-will? Unfortunately I have to report that it doesn't. Not knowing the future doesn't alter that it can't be elected by the will of the agent. Sub-atomic particles are responsible for the 'randomness' or indeterminable flow of quantum. At no point does this translate to man's will being 'free', it is only a slave to a dice roll dealt by physics. This will conclude my opening case against free-will, as I will include a discussion on theological terms if my opponent wishes to take the debate in that direction. Until then, I will assume the materialist axiom is suitable for us and the audience. 1. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org..."	CON	2
S2c51f919-A178351b7	Humans possess free-will	"It seems that the majority of your post was dedicated to going into various details in how quantum theory works, but virtually none of it refutes what I've already touched upon in describing quantum, or otherwise demonstrates that my key point in respect to indeterminism not qualifying for free-will. One part that I see that actually seems to be for me to address, is where you ask about infinite possible universes. There is a very big difference between ""all possible universes"", and ""infinite possible universes"". All 'possible universes' would constitute an important part of the mainstream super-string theory, wherein the 10th dimension represents the totality of existence; all possible worlds through all of time considered as a single dimensional point. This does not inherently imply anything is 'infinite', but a finite number in consistency with what the range of possibilities are. This is where I see a problem in trying to describe 'infinite' possible worlds: can impossible things happen in one of these possible worlds? If so, it's literally impossible, if not, it seems as though it cannot be infinite. The idea that something can be possible, implies that something else can be 'impossible', and the possibility of impossibility inherently defies infinity. That anything can be 'possible' implies limitations. So is it even possible for free-will to exist? Not rationally, no. All things that exist, just by virtue of having the characteristic of 'existing', are constrained by some other force. To exist or not, cannot by logical necessity be controlled by the thing that does or doesn't exist. It might be that all things that exist fundamentally exist through all of time as some uniform body, maybe the superstring of the 10th dimension, or existence can be made by some force out of non-existence, but at neither rate can something determine itself, no particle or other unfathomable form of existence, spiritual or not, can logically choose its own nature before it exists. As a consequence, nothing can logically be thought of as having a 'free-will', especially not humans in *this* world or any other possible one."	CON	3
S113e39e8-A9af43a7c	God cannot be morally good while giving humans free will	"Morally good: God is the standard of goodness. Everything good flows form Him (James 1:17). For humans to be morally good, We must conform to the prescribed will of God. Basically follow God's commandments. ? It has not showed himself and the Bible is not evidence of Its work instead a telling of events by a human. It cannot be verified it is instead assumed to be true. What I wanted you to define was a general definition of morally good. God is not the standard of goodness since It did create the Devil knowing full well what It will do. That is not goodness if all a creature does is evil. Free will: God has foreordained all things which come to pass (Acts 4:28 || Proverbs 16:33). God alone has absolute freedom. Man's will is restricted by the nature which God gives him. Since we are sinners by nature (Ephesians 2:3), We can do nothing but sin apart from the grace of God (to be found in Jesus Christ). ""For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. "" (Romans 14:23b). Debate was about how God is not morally god while also giving humans free will. I am assuming free will exists and God for this debate to occur. Guess I will still rebut this. By saying Man's will is restricted by the nature which God gives him states why we do not have free will. You pretty much made the argument for why free will does not exist. My premise 2 rebuttal of your response. God is partly to blame for the wrongdoings of mankind. God assuming you believe this It is all-knowing which does mean It can know something happens before it happens. The extreme example would be God allows the rapist rape while also watching it take place. To me the act of allowing the rape is wrong and watching it too also shows no empathy by It. My premise 3 rebuttal of your response. You missed the part that It is all-knowing. God knew full well a human would do more evil then good but still allowed for its creation. Not all humans would do more evil then good but some will and God has allowed that to happen. Humans are not all-knowing which is why God is different and many other reasons. If we were all-knowing and allowed for evil to go on that would make us evil but God is somehow an exception. You can say evil occurs for good to occur. As far as I know God is all-knowing and can realise a path where there can be all-good but chooses to gift powers to humans to do evil. To say God is not capable of allowing humans to do all-good is not a fair representation of Its powers. 1. Jesus is not proven to exist so I am assuming he did. Jesus was not human. Humans are flawed but Jesus wasn't. God gave the talents to Jesus but not to humans. That shows God is capable of creating a sinless being but cannot do it for humans. God can but does create humans with sin. To that very act is sinful. 2. I kinda knew you were going to bring up the greater good. God is all-knowing but cannot find a way to have good without evil? Jesus is example of sinless being created by It but It cannot do it for humans. Humans are flawed because God created them that way. By also knowing what they would do and still go with creating them God is to blame for human wrong doings due to nature of Its powers like all-knowing. The Fall of Adam was predicted by God since It is all knowing. Knowing full-well what Adam would do It still allowed Adam to do it. That is another non-act by God to somehow to create a greater good. From what I see Adam and Eve were the originators of humans. The humans with flaws. Meaning by God simply not acting on Adam It allowed Adam to create flawed humans which sin. Given the all-knowing of God's nature It is still to blame for this. God acts when It wants to but doesn't when It doesn't want to. Jesus was created by God to save humanity but where was God to stop the Crusaders committing evil? 3. Our parents made us but they are not away from sin. Fathers can rape their children and mothers can be abusive to you. What makes God different? It is the creator. He wills states the he does not need to do be morally good and still be God. My assertion would be It created us for Its amusment. I choose to believe God does not love us instead created us for his own selfish reasons. Those selfish reasons not need to be morally good since it is Might makes Right. Moral right and wrongs are subjective. To me I determine them by the affect it might have to me and others from my limited perception compared to God. Example: I am cleaning my room. The affect it would have on my mother is that she will have more time to do other things and it would also teach me to be self-reliant. From that I did a morally right thing. I did not need God I only required myself. 4. Will does not give humans a time frame. God can say evil does not go unpunished but from my point of view Bill Cosby raped many people and used his money to only get a sentence of 10 years. Am I supposed to believe he will get his just punishment in the afterlife? There is no evidence for it and God has allowed the evil to go unpunished until Cosby is sent to hell. It is ironic how that works. Do a evil act and this reality and get punished in another. That is not just since from what humans are concerned he died raping women and had a weak sentence at the end of it. 5. God is incomprehensible but you still choose to believe it. Why does God punish us for something we cannot comprehend? That is also evil. To expect to believe God on faith rather then the standard we have progressed to today. If It does not tell us why It allows to evil to go unpunished why should we trust his judgement? Because we have no other choice? This would be a might makes right argument. God is not morally good instead It is our supreme being and we should blindly follow It since we do not have power to do otherwise yet I am allowed to disgrace Its name and many other religions are wrong or maybe Christianity is the wrong religion. I highly doubt you have thoroughly spent your time deciding which religion instead you were born into Christianity. Lets say Christianity is the correct religion what about the Arabian's who have not heard of Christianity or the people of North Korea either? Was that just or a mistake of God. What reason would God give to not allow everyone to know the word of God in the Bible. Simple answer maybe just maybe The Bible is not the word of God and God just might be something that has no impact in our reality. If I was talking from someone from Saudi Arabia they would say the same thing as you but in a different context. You might say to this your religion is right but use similar reasoning as the Arabians. We do not have sufficient reason that God is good since It is all knowing God can find a way to remove evil and only create good but It chooses not to. I don't lack knowledge that Bill Cosby raped many women and is only getting 10 years. We lack knowledge but God made us that way and It would allow me to think that it is Its fault. God all-knowing cannot find a way to only create good but did it with Jesus but not humans. God is not morally good if It allows evil to continue. It is all-knowing and can find a way to create only good but It chose differently. Didn't copy your argument because there was not enough space so I left a number to show which argument I am speaking of. This time you are allowed to rebut in the last round and you were in our previous but you chose not to. Make sure you rebut me in Round 3. Biggest question I would like you to answer. God does not need to be morally good to be God. So why is It morally good? May we still learn something new"	PRO	4
S113e39e8-Ae5244b18	God cannot be morally good while giving humans free will	Copy of the same debate I did before but hopefully this time Against would stay until it is over. I am going by the basis that God does exist. I want the other side to show me how God is morally good while also giving us free will. There are inconsistencies with free will that I can mention but I did think about that it but I will narrow it down to morals to keep it simple. Wanting someone who believes God is morally good not someone who is playing devil's advocate. Arguments starts the round you start. God: the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being. I'll leave the definition of morally good to Against since it will give them more room to give counter arguments and starting arguments. Premise: 1. By God giving free will to humans It has given the power to humans to do wrong. 2. For God to be morally good It must do what is right. 3. By God giving free will to humans It is not morally good. May both of us learn something new.	PRO	5
S2c51f919-A3c2132ef	Humans possess free-will	Well I suppose I'll just summarize in a very broad way everything I've asserted above: 1. If determinism is true, free-will cannot exist. 2. If indeterminism is true, free-will cannot exist. 3. The world can only be either deterministic or indeterministic. 4. Therefor free-will cannot exist. In another way: 1. Freedom implies without (at least to some extent) constraint. 2. Free-will is 'freedom' in respect to a being's will. 3. Fundamental existence is incompatible with 'not-constrained' 4. Freedom of will is incompatible with existence.	CON	6

S2c51f919-Ae9db159c	Humans possess free-will	"I would like to thank my opponent for his evidence. In classical mechanics, it was held that there is one world with only one line of events in a chain of cause and effect. This was a possibility for how the universe could be structured and at the time it was a phenomenal idea. Now we have a better understanding of the nature of physics due to changes in our thinking, and new evidence. As our knowledge grew, we become more and more adept at building on our theories of how our environment works. Now we are at the point where we can photograph particles, and see into some of the darkest corners of the universe. Our knowledge only expanded with the advent of quantum mechanics. This piece of mathematical machinery helped to better our understanding of the sub-atomic level, and gain a better glimpse into the workings of our world. In quantum mechanics there are several theories concerning multiple universes. There are some that deal with infinite universes. In one of those universes, could there be a universe that contains intelligent beings with the ability to conduct themselves in a manner of their own choosing, and have the will to do as they please excluding external coercion. With an infinite amount of universes, the possibilities are infinite. This is just one theory of many. My opponent describes two types of possible world systems, a one-world system that is based upon clockwork mechanization's and another that covers multiple worlds. The interesting case of infinite universes was not covered. In quantum mechanics, there is not precise way to predict which world will be next. Once you are in one world, then you are in another one. This all happens in an instant of time. If the possible universes are infinite, then free will has the possibility of existing in a multiverse of many universes. If in the last situation, quantum indeterminacy remains to be true, but multiworld theory false the particles can choose from a random set of possibilities. The mention of whether or not the possibilities are infinite. How are the possibilities constrained? In what set do they exist if everything is random. (1) A position argued from is that there is a lack of human knowledge to find the determinable facts. These were called hidden variables by Einstein. The conclusion reached from these hidden variables is that of a probabilistically determinative way. There was a finding on the quantum mechanics of statistical predictions which would be violated if local hidden variables existed. There has been rational skepticism about the traditional determinism due to the quantum mechanics, as reality is not seemingly absolutely determined (2). Accordingly with the Copenhagen interpretation, the most basic properties of matter at times behave indeterminable. Due to the collapse of the wave function, there is a state at which the system can no longer be predicted. Quantum mechanics only predicts the probabilities of these outcomes. The interpretations of quantum physics must reject locality or reject counterfactual definiteness. One of the problems with the many-worlds theory is its lack of experimentation. We cannot be sure of experimental results. Astronomer Sir Arthur Eddignton commented that, ""a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physical understanding."" This would leave the Uncertainty as an interesting result of quantum indeterminism. It would not be due to hidden variables but indeterminism in nature itself (3).

S1854a9c7-A287e8886	Free Will	"I appreciate the continued engagement from my debate opponent. This is turning out to be pretty fun for my first debate experience here. I'll get right into my rebuttal. Con, I think, is starting to delve into topics that aren't relevant to the debate. Con brings up chaos in the universe, which I assume he means to be completely random and unpredictable events, to show that he isn't a determinist. It might be the case that Con is not a determinist about certain events in the universe, maybe there is some randomness, but we are talking about the will and whether it is determined or free. If the will is not free it is determined by past occurrences and external stimuli. If one of these proposed chaotic events happens, it may influence the path that the will will take, but the will is still being determined by that event. Con has stated that they don't believe an agent controls the will, so that leaves the events and stimuli to affect whatever we choose to do, and that is determinism as it applies to the will. Talking about chaos in the universe is just a red herring. My first argument: For someone to be responsible for an action, as it applies to this debate, would mean that there was no constraint on the individual to choose one way or the other and there was no coercion in making that choice and that the choice originated in the individual. It is a moral/rational responsibility. One simply being the actor in an event does not mean they are necessarily responsible for what they have done. For instance, a robot could be the actor in playing a piano, but that robot is not the one responsible for that action. The one who programmed the robot is. The robot could not have not done what its programmer had determined for it to do, and it was not the one who decided to act as such. It only did what it was determined to do. Likewise, if we don't have free will, then we are constrained to do what we do by our programming; what the physical synapses in our brains cause us to do in response to external stimuli. It is not us deciding what to do, but it is the events around us that cause us to act. Therefore, we cannot choose otherwise and we are not the origin of our choices. The dog example fails, I think, to refute what we're speaking of as being responsible in this debate. We do not hold dogs morally responsible when they steal food, because dogs, as far as we know, do not do things with intention. If they do lack a will of any kind, they are simply responding to the external stimuli. That is why we don't charge dogs with theft when they steal food. We don't think they are in control of those kinds of urges. But we as humans not only are responsible for what we do, we expect people who break the law to have been able to not break the law. They should have acted otherwise, and that implies that they actually can. Has Con provided a reason to think my first argument is faulty? I don't think so. They complained about my use of the word responsible, but after clarification, that the responsibility in question is moral/rational responsibility, and expansion on my argument, I think it clearly holds. Until Con can refute either of the premises of this first argument, then by modus tollens, it follows deductively. Second argument: As I predicted, premise 2 is the controversial premise. I don't think Con has actually attempted to deal with the premise. In attacking the premise Con says, ""We can be wrong. It can be the case that what is true is not obvious without further investigation. Such as quantum mechanics. We at one point in history (ancient Greece) could believe that we have to be able to choose, but as time goes by we learn more and more how more and more of our actions are in fact determined."" I don't know how this is supposed to counter to my argument. Con is begging the question in a couple of different ways. 1) Con is assuming a rational process of coming to knowledge when he says that we have discovered that our actions are determined after all. That is exactly what is up for debate; is a rational process of discovering truth possible if our wills are determined? 2) He's assuming our actions are determined, which is the subject of this debate. Not to mention that this really doesn't matter. Of course we can be wrong about things. But if our wills are determined, then what we're wrong about we couldn't have been right about. As philosopher William Lane Craig points out: **""There is a sort of dizzying, self-defeating character to determinism. For if one comes to believe that determinism is true, one has to believe that the reason he has come to believe it is simply that he was determined to do so. One has not in fact been able to weigh the arguments pro and con and freely make up one's mind on that basis. The difference between the person who weighs the arguments for determinism and rejects them and the person who weighs them and accepts them is wholly that one was determined by causal factors outside himself to believe and the other not to believe. When you come to realize that your decision to believe in determinism was itself determined and that even your present realization of that fact right now is likewise determined, a sort of vertigo sets in, for everything that you think, even this very thought itself, is outside your control. Determinism could be true; but it is very hard to see how it could ever be rationally affirmed, since its affirmation undermines the rationality of its affirmation.""** http://www.reasonablefaith.org... Con says, ""The defense of premise 2 all hinges on determinism which I don't maintain because I understand that there are certain unpredictable things in the quantum world that do not have free will."" But we aren't talking about unpredictability in the quantum world, we're talking about whether the will is free. If it is not, then it is determined. So while Con may not believe all events are determined, certainly he believes the will is; he's said he does. If not, then I have no idea what we're debating. Con may be surprised to learn that quantum indeterminacy is actually quite popular among free will theorists such as Robert Kane. They think that it may actually point to the origin of making free choices. Con is using a free will argument. Con is correct in that we are talking about the source of actions. Unless we choose our actions, we aren't the source of them. Something else would be. Con seems to not realize that agent causation is not the only theory of libertarian free will. There are several options that do not appeal to an immaterial agent. Since my opponent's quibble with premise 2 didn't really substantively deal with it, and begged the question, I think that argument 2 is still sound. I have offered 2 arguments for free will that I think are good and have withstood the scrutiny offered so far. But remember, my opponent also bears a burden of proof. If you recall, they claim that free will is not only false, are arguing against the very idea of free will. So, my opponent needs to 1) refute my arguments, 2) argue that free will is in fact false, and 3) show that free will is somehow an incoherent concept. Unless and until this is done, I think it is clear that free will is coherent and we actually posses it."	PRO	9
S113e39e8-A6bfbcc4d	God cannot be morally good while giving humans free will	"God: The Triune God revealed through creation and the Bible. Morally good: God is the standard of goodness. Everything good flows form Him (James 1:17). For humans to be morally good, We must conform to the prescribed will of God. Basically follow God's commandments. Free will: God has foreordained all things which come to pass (Acts 4:28 || Proverbs 16:33). God alone has absolute freedom. Man's will is restricted by the nature which God gives him. Since we are sinners by nature (Ephesians 2:3), We can do nothing but sin apart from the grace of God (to be found in Jesus Christ). ""For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. "" (Romans 14:23b). Analysis of your argument: P1: I accept this premise. P2: I deny this premise. God does not derive His goodness by conforming to some moral law greater than Himself. Rather, God is the transcendent One, Who gives us the moral law. God is Goodness. If I could rewrite this premise, It would say ""God is morally good. Therefore, He must always do what is right"". P3: I deny this premise (or conclusion)? It does not logically follow from your first two premises because you have two different senses of ""doing wrong"". God doing wrong, Is different from, God giving humans the ability to do wrong. Normally in life, We do not hold responsible the primary cause for the secondary cause's sin. If I give a man a shovel, And the man murders another with it, Then I am not morally responsible. My argument: God has a morally sufficient reason for the evil that exists. 1. There is no one (besides Jesus) who deserves to live in a world free from evil. We are all under the wrath of God, And we all deserve an eternity in Hell. Anything short of this is not injustice, But it is mercy. 2. God works greater good through evil. The Fall of Adam ultimately resulted in the Gospel of Christ. Genesis 50:20 ""As for you, You meant evil against me, But God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, To preserve many people alive"". Romans 8:28 ""And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, For those who are called according to his purpose. "" 3. God has a right to do as He wills. Firstly, He made us, And everything flows from Him. Romans 9:20 says ""But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this? ”"". Secondly, As previously stated, God is the standard for goodness. To accuse Him of evil is to adopt some other arbitrary standard of goodness. If you are going to accuse God of not being morally good, It would be helpful to me if you would state how you determine moral rights and wrongs. 4. God will avenge evil. Deuteronomy 32:35 says ""Vengeance is mine, And recompense, For the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, And their doom comes swiftly. "" Evil does not go unpunished. People will either pay for their sins eternally in Hell, Or Jesus took upon Himself their guilt on the cross. God is a Just. 5. There is a sense of mystery to this. What I mean by ""mystery"" is not a magic trump card where I win, You lose. Rather, I mean that God is incomprehensible. God reveals some things to us, And not other things. Deuteronomy 29:29 says ""The secret things belong to the LORD our God, But the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever"". Neither do we have perfect access to the mind of God. Isaiah 55:8 says ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ” declares the LORD. "" What I mean by all this: We have sufficient reason to believe that God is good, But God has not revealed to us why He works His will in particular ways. So, We can know that God is good even through this present evil, And yet we lack knowledge as to why exactly He would use evil at all."	CON	10
S6acab35f-Ae54a946e	Free will is an illusion	Hi Bernardsteapot, A great topic of conversation. Perhaps we should get clear on a definition of free will? I'm open to you providing a definition. Otherwise, I propose: An act is free if it was caused by the reasons of the agent, and the agent could have chosen otherwise. I will start by providing four arguments for free will: Argument 1: Common Sense Intuition: Humans appear to have choice, so the burden of proof lies on those disputing what is experienced as true by billions. Argument 2: An ought implies a can, and a cannot implies an ought not. Without free will, the agent cannot control what it does, so cannot be held morally responsible. Hence moral responsibility fails. And, without moral responsibility, the reactive attitudes such as praise, blame, contempt, admiration, lack foundation as well. Argument 3: In general, evolutionary processes select for traits with adaptive benefit to the organism. The appearance of free will, if lacking causal efficacy, will have no adaptive benefit. So, probably, evolutionary processes would not select for organisms wasting resources generating epiphenomenal experiences of choice. Argument 4: beliefs are considered knowledge when reasons cause those beliefs, and not considered knowledge when blind processes cause those beliefs. If free will is false, the beliefs of knowers do not cause the conclusions of knowers, rather, those beliefs are caused by blind microphysical processes determined to occur prior to birth. So, humans would have no knowledge. So, those who know free will is false would not know that. So, the belief that free will is false is self-stultifying. Now, on to some of the concerns you raised. You say 'one cannot control what it is that they want'. Why not? I wanted to debate this topic with you. This 'want' to debate the free will issue was created over the course of many years of thinking about what I value in life, and acting in ways that shape my character to want to debate issues. Why did I have no control in any of this? You say 'we have no idea what we intend to do until that intention itself comes into existence'. Why not? I could have guessed beforehand that I would have intended to accept your debate before I saw your debate was open. As we become self-aware, we become more knowledgeable and accurate about what we would choose to do in different situations. It was not random that I accepted this free will debate. If randomness ruled, I may have opened up the section on 'Movies' and debated whether Star Wars is good or not. No, my intentions quite regularly follow logically from my character. From the quotes you provided, I presume you operate within the Sam Harris school of thinking: our conscious intentions are the result of unconscious, uncontrolled processes. Please clarify if that is your view. Harris is not entirely correct on this, but I don't want to get into it if that is not your argument.	CON	11
S9f9b50af-A79b772bb	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"==Rebuttals== I have been chosen to prove why total control under the universal principles: -Concern for the well-being of others -Respect for the autonomy of others -Trustworthiness & honesty -Willing compliance with the law (with the exception of civil disobedience) -Basic justice; being fair -Refusing to take unfair advantage -Benevolence: doing good -Preventing harm Is better under total control rather than free will. ===Personal ethics: Just because there is proof that the free will world has ethics, does not mean that the world perfects those ethics and perfects justice. Example from round 1 (there is good in everyone): Since there is good in everyone, it does not mean that everyone has perfected it. ===Anarchy: I said that in a world of free will, anarchy is disorder. My definition of disorder is crime. Then, I said that in a world of free will, anarchy is not logically possible. Thus comes to my next point my opponent has misunderstood my argument. My argument was that total control is not determined by the type government. Nor does total control come from the type of government. ===Examples that claim bluesteel needs to reevaluate arguments: R1) -This is my establishment of right. We would only be controlled to follow these Principles. (Under the principles says nothing about eating different types of steaks.) R1)-In a world of free will, without someone steering the wheel of the car, the car is not in control. Free will for one person can prove to be detrimental to someone else. ""It is all fun and games until someone gets hurt."" Total control under the universal principles mentioned would drive the car and the car would be humans. (If I gave total control to government, then humans would be in charge of humans. Meaning I am letting humans drive humans. This is not the case, I established from the beginning that humans are not in charge. It is proven that I meant this by the statement above.) R1)-With humans living according to the principles, this society would work. (I said humans... meaning all humans, not humans controlling other humans.) ===Bluesteel’s arguments that need revision: The Statist society mentioned does not practice the principles mentioned. If they did, this proves that humans should not rule over other humans under free will anyway. Humans should not live in anarchy under free will as well, it is not logically impossible. All of his arguments about people controlling other people are moot for my opponent thinks that power only derives from the government, and that he thinks that I am actually debating this point. My opponent's other points about Somalia do not count for humans under total control, power does not derive from humans, humans do not have the ability for total control. Especially under the set universal principles so that argument is void. ===Car analogy: Systematical error, my opponent states that cars can drive themselves effectively... Under the world of free will, humans cannot drive themselves in compliance to the principles. We can draw up semantics but the execution is not always there. ===bastardizing free will: My opponent is stating that understanding right is better than doing the right thing. ""Having a conception of ethics, like the nonaggression principle, solves my opponent’s objection. People can have free will and yet live by certain norms of behavior. In fact, studies at the Infant Cognition Center at Yale show that even babies know right from wrong, meaning acting morally, such as respecting someone’s right to life, is an innate attribute. [3]"" In this statement, it does not say anything about doing the right thing. Instead he talks about understanding the right thing. ===There is good in everyone: There is good in everyone, so everyone should want to do the right thing. The problem with people is that all people do not do the right thing. ===Communism is good: When my opponent said, that has nothing to do with free will, he was thinking that total control of humans had something to do with the government controlling humans. By the way, bluesteel is wrong, true Marxist communism has never been practiced. Why has it not been practiced one asks? The reason why is because no government has successfully went from capitalist to socialist to communism ever. In fact true communism is extreme left. Yes, free of government, free of class. This is exactly what it sounds like, anarchy. This is the reason why true communism has never been practiced, because it is not logically possible in a world with free will. This is what free will has to do with true communism. With free will, true communism has never been attempted. Since true communism is anarchy, Stalin’s Russia never practiced true communism, Cuba nor has China ever practiced true communism as well. ===Stalin is not Marxist Communism No it is not, my opponent’s statement still comes from a confused opponent who thinks that I would put humans in total control of other humans. This is laughable. ===Free will the ability to choose: Yes, under free will, people have the ability to choose what they want. My world sort of works the same. In the world of total control, you are controlled to do everything as long as it follows my principles. Concern for the well-being of others Respect for the autonomy of others Trustworthiness & honesty Willing compliance with the law (with the exception of civil disobedience) Basic justice; being fair Refusing to take unfair advantage Benevolence: doing good Preventing harm Now, my opponent brings up a good point that he wants to eat a juicy steak, then bam he is forced to eat chicken. Hedonism- On one view, human beings always act in pursuit of what they think will give them the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. http://plato.stanford.edu... This falls under concern for well-being. If one desired steak, he would eat steak as long as it fell into compliance with the other rules. Such as, one can have the steak as long as it is not the last piece of steak. Bluesteel has to prove that taking the last piece of steak in a world of free will, is better than living in compliance to total control. He would have that explain why greed would be the better choice. Going to work for 16 hours and sleeping in is the same thing. Let us say that one wants to sleep in (well-being) but cannot, because everyone is counting on that person to wake up at 6 (compliance with the law). Or working that 16 hours you cannot work 16 hours, (well-being) unless your job is short on people(being fair). ===Existentialism “According to Derrida, political and moral responsibility only exists where one has to go through the confusion to get to the truth of the undecided . . .” It was hard to establish universal right and wrong, but we did it. Now I think it was already decided that basic humans know morals, what is the good in just knowing the truth. Shouldn’t we just go all the way into doing the right thing all of the time according to the principles. The principles are not demanding, one is controlled to do what he desires unless it interferes with the other principles. Who cares about credit for doing the right thing? One should do the right thing because it is what one is supposed to do not because one gets rewarded for it… can I get a hell yeah for that one. ===who will be in Control My opponent asks who as in person. There is no person in control of controlling humans in total control."	PRO	12
S1854a9c7-A451f08a9	Free Will	I am taking the position that free will is a coherent position. My opponent is arguing against the very idea of free will. This means they must show that free will is not only not true, but that it is somehow necessarily not true. Now, we must not equivocate on what we are talking about here. I take it from reading my opponent's opening argument that they are an incompatibilist, as am I. They take the position that free will is not compatible with determinism and determinism is true. I take the same position, but I think determinism is false. I believe in libertarian free will. I will defend two argument to support free will. The consequence argument and an argument from rationality. The first argument goes as such: 1) If we do not have free will, we are not responsible for our actions. 2) We are responsible for our actions. 3) Therefore, we have free will. Now this isn't precisely the form that the consequence argument normally takes, because it's purpose was to argue for incompatibilism. But, the conclusion of the consequence argument is what makes up premise 1 in my argument. I will cite Peter Van Inwagen's formulation of the consequence argument to support premise 1: If determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws of nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what went on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up to us.(1) My opponent has already said they agree with premise 2, that we are responsible for our actions. Therefore, it would follow that we in fact have free will. Notice that this is a deductive conclusion. Even if I couldn't answer all of the questions posed, my opponent would still need to find a way to defeat Van Inwagen's argument, which is my premise 1. My second argument: 1) If we don't have free will, then we necessarily believe as we do. 2) If we necessarily believe as we do, then rationality is an illusion. 3) Rationality is not an illusion. C1) Therefore we don't necessarily believe as we do. C2) Therefore we have free will. I think the only controversial premise would be number 2. 1 is just a short definition of determinism. 3 is obvious, otherwise why would my opponent want to have a debate. In defense of premise two, think about what the process of rational thought is. Rational thought is the weighing of ideas and considering of options in coming to a conclusion. If determinism is true, you must necessarily choose what you do in fact choose. You cannot choose otherwise. So if you are considering two different options, A or B, then on determinism it is already decided which you will choose. You aren't actually weighing any options. The option you will choose has already been determined. Thus, if determinism is true, you aren't really considering and weighing options, but simply going trough the motions of a puppet. And if that is true, it would follow that rationality is an illusion. But, seemingly my opponent agrees with me and does not think that rationality is an illusion. Therefore it would follow deductively that we have free will. Now, as it pertains to the questions my opponent has asked, I'm not sure how they are relevant. I don't see an argument from my opponent that the existence of free will depends on adequate answers to these questions. Really, there hasn't been an argument against free will at all. My opponent has simply criticized agent-causation, which I didn't even need to argue for my case. If my opponent can give some reason to think that answering these question is necessary for my argument to succeed, then I will answer them. So, as I have been the only one to offer an argument, my opponent must first tear down my arguments and then construct one of their own that shows that free will actually doesn't exist.

S1854a9c7-Ab610d8c1	Free Will	"First let me say thank you for taking me up on my first debate. I appreciate any constructive criticism. Thanks also for doing this in a rational, respectful way. It is appreciated. Quote: ""They take the position that free will is not compatible with determinism and determinism is true. I take the same position, but I think determinism is false. I believe in libertarian free will."" -- Not necessarily the case, there can be chaos in the universe and it not be due to free will. If there is chaos in the universe than determinism is false. I believe there is some chaos in the universe (at least in the quantum world) so I'm not nailed to determinism. Just against free will. Argument: ""1) If we do not have free will, we are not responsible for our actions."" ***responsible means what? A dog can be responsible for eating my dinner before I get to the table it doesn't mean the dog had free will. If that's too complicated an animal (not to suggest you couldn't understand merely that it is a higher order thinking creature) substitute jellyfish for dog and my point stands. ""2) We are responsible for our actions."" We are responsible in that we are the most significant contributor to something happening. In other words, I am not as responsible for Obama being elected as my elected representative is. The person in China who doesn't have enough money for food is not responsible for Obama being elected. ""3) Therefore, we have free will."" Don't see how that follows. Basically what is being done here is fudging the word 'responsible'. A virus can be responsible or the primary cause of my death but I don't see the virus as having free will. So next argument (and you're right 2 is where I want to go) ""2) If we necessarily believe as we do, then rationality is an illusion."" We can be wrong. It can be the case that what is true is not obvious without further investigation. Such as quantum mechanics. We at one point in history (ancient Greece) could believe that we have to be able to choose, but as time goes by we learn more and more how more and more of our actions are in fact determined. I can stick an electrode in your brain and make you lift your arm. I have determined your action. We now know the electric current in your brain is what determines arm raising. Now this is an almost ridiculous simplification but point still holds. The first premise that we necessarily believe that our choices are free is also suspicious. I don't see how anyone MUST believe something other than we exist. I don't believe in choice, kind of defeats the premise there... The defense of premise 2 all hinges on determinism which I don't maintain because I understand that there are certain unpredictable things in the quantum world that do not have free will (and you'd have a hard time defending a charmed quark does have free will) suggesting that something could have gone differently and saying it has a will to choose are not the same thing. Main point: We are talking about the source of an action, not the alternatives. I believe in possibilities, just not agency. If you don't want to answer the questions ok. I think if you assert a will exists they ought to be addressed but the argument you're taking is all about options, which I concede there are. My argument against agency claims introducing agency violates Ockham's Razor. Which if that is not enough is subject to the fallacy of argumentum ad ignoratium. http://en.wikipedia.org... I also point out that even though options are given to all creatures, (such as the scorpion could have moved to the left) we do not ascribe agency to all creatures, just the ones most like us. This only proves we want to have agency, just like we want to have an immortal soul that will be given a mansion once we die (sorry for the Ricky Gervais movie reference). I don't see how just because an explanation appeals to our emotions it becomes rationally necessary where if it is not the case rationality is an illusion. I don't see a qualitative difference between the decision making process of a gorilla and a human I just see a quantitative one. We are more complicated thinker true, but my opponent in order to assert this new thing called will that is free emerges (or has a brute emergence - thank you panpsychics) they have to show how or why when the same parts are arranged in one way to produce a horse brain we have no free will but in a slightly different way we have human brain which has free will sometimes. We are not allowing the addition of any more parts than the same protons and electrons that make up the panda, the jellyfish or the hedgehog, otherwise all the questions I asked in the beginning involving these magic parts must be answered. It seems my opponent (who again I want to thank for taking me up on my first debate, and I appreciate the rational and respectful approach he/she is taking) claims if we don't believe in free will reason is an illusion. I humbly suggest that there is a chance that the thing being asserted that is not necessary, that has no evidence, that exists in my opinion only as a way of making us feel more important than we are, may be the illusion, and not reason."

S9f9b50af-Abc0507c8	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	1) Where Did This Come From? As I said earlier in round 3, “Thoughts are first, control follows.”- ASB. I’m not advocating free will. If one wanted steak and it was with compliance to the rules then he would be forced to eat steak. Free will: 2. the power of making free choices that is unconstrained by external circumstances or by an agency such as fate or divine will. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... These are not free choices, there are circumstances involved in these thoughts. The principles are involved with making these thoughts. Total Control is complete domination and/or manipulation of another subject.http://www.bookrags.com... This is total control; it has nothing to do with thought. It is exactly what is says; is complete domination and/or manipulation of another subject. This means that I can think one thing and then something completely opposite can happen by force. This falls under total control. Are we tracking here? Humans cannot drive themselves to be in total compliance to the universal principles that humans themselves have created. This means that humans cannot act in ‘total’ and ‘complete’ obedience to the universal principles we have created under free will. 2) The known is better than the unknown. Last ditch argument… Bluesteel took this debate knowing that total control is not likely, yet he brings up this argument in the 3rd Round. Who came up with this opinion? So I guess it is safe to say that a cure for AIDS, since it is the not probable, will be worse than a cure for AIDS. Is it really that safe to assume that all things that are improbable are better than the known because Bluesteel said so? Bluesteel continually brings up God in this debate like as if He has something to do with this debate… God has nothing to do with this debate. Can you please drop it? Bluesteel brings no proof in saying that the unknown is more dangerous than the known. 3) Driving the car analogy: I have been conveying this argument all debate. Humans cannot drive themselves to be in total compliance to the universal principles that humans themselves have created. My analogy to driving the car stands. Never did I say that humans are not capable of doing it sometimes. Of course humans can do it sometimes… cars can drive themselves without the foot on the gas as well. This means sometimes. So Bluesteel, I’m sure I can provide evidence of where humans do not act morally all of the time. When was the last time someone killed another person… today. 4) Rothbard was a moron: Anyone who believes in jumping from capitalism to anarchy or true communism ‘successfully’ is a moron. He obviously never followed the other nations that did so. Soviet Russia, China, any other country that practices pseudo-communism. Even the other Libertarians did not completely follow this guy. 5) What Locke Believed in? Persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a ‘state of nature’(anarchy) would have ‘stronger moral limits on their action’ than accepted by Hobbes, but recognized that ‘people would still live in fear of one another.’ http://en.wikipedia.org... - Locke does not think that people living in anarchy would trust each other. Keep in mind that this is still a world of free will here. In a world of free will, anarchy is not logical. In a world of forced will, one would not worry about living in fear for nobody would harm one another. 6) “ Derrida says, is that morality DOES NOT EXIST when our actions are forced. To act morally, we must go through the aporia of the undecidable - we must face that difficult moral choice and choose correctly.” – Bluesteel - Derrida lived in a world of free will, he sees things every day, like we do that just make him mad. He could not comprehend a world ruled by total control, according to his saying, doing the correct thing is a chore. With us being forced to act correctly, it no longer becomes a chore. When being forced to do the right thing, one does not need to face that “difficult” moral choice to choose correctly. - Derrida is also a nihilist, if Derrida actually said this statement, according to Derrida, how could have chosen correctly if choosing correctly is not certain at all. I’d love to hear what my opponent has for this.	PRO	15
S9f9b50af-A9ad23e55	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"1) Competing rights claims huh? My opponent is basically saying that concern for other animals’ counts as concern for others. No it does not for other animals are not humans. Crops are not others either. My opponent keeps on urging me to give up the ""controller""; one does not need to know the controller. If everything happens in compliance with the rules, there is no need to even reveal a controller. 2) Free will with a slight Caveat. No it is still total control since it is not free will. In free will one has a choice with no limitations, since there are limitations in thought, it is not free will. Total control then takes over in forcing one to do something. This is total control, not free will, there is no free choice. 3) Things that exist are better than things that do not exist: My opponent establishes that everything that exists is better than things that do not exist. My opponent says that he would rather have a real Ferrari than an imaginary Ferrari. This means that he would rather have his real world to an imaginary world; real death than imaginary death. - Should I say that free will does not exist? It has been proven that people can move before thought comes in. This is in the real world; this proves that free will does not exist. Now, if I was to keep on this case which I am not, I would conclude that free will like controlled will does not exist. I am not going to play this debate as so. This is just to provide an example FOR BLUESTEEL ONLY that all things that exist can be the same as things that do not exist. - By the way, who said that he would have that real Ferrari in this world anyway? Maybe in this world, he would never get that real Ferrari. In another world, one could have that Ferrari. - This opinion has no fact, just speculation. - I can bring up more examples than AIDS, as one can see, by the way the cure for AIDS does not exist, so one could tally AIDS under things that don't exist. It is possible, but does not exist at the moment. 4) A vast majority may not kill this was just one example to establish my point. Everybody in their life has done at least one of these in their life, lied, cheated, stolen, murdered, overall bad, not following the law, no concern for the well being of others. This is my point. 5) Rothbard was a moron this is a statement that still stands on my side, anarcho-capitalist is worse, than making the jump from capitalist to anarchy entirely. Who in heck actually thinks that there could be capitalism without a government to monitor it? This is bananas, as we see today, government is trying desperately to hold up this economy, but even the government has problems. Just imagine if we suddenly got rid of the government........ Now come back to reality. Woo I'm glad everyone thought that he was a moron as well. 6) Yes, my system does have an answer to the conflict of interest: Luckily, the principles were made by man; therefore, there are laws that determine which one to save. - Concern for the well-being of others. - Benevolence: doing good - Preventing harm One will be forced to take which ever option that best suits these requirements. This is better than what man could do on his own free will. Example: What if that one person that was on the one side was the father or the son of the person that has to save that one person. That one person probably would have chosen to save that one person than that family of three; therefore complete control is always better in this situation. 7) I did Answer His Totalitarian to the extreme: Total control has nothing to do with the government that is being run. Total control has to do with ethics in controlling the people, not the government. I believe this may be the third time that I had said this. Are we tracking? 8) Marx denies free will http://catholiceducation.org... So I think it is safe to say that he would not mind the idea of being controlled to do the right thing in compliance to the universal principles of man. I think that he would believe that this way would probably be the most efficient way to carry on about true communism as well. 9) Writing the Rules: Do I need to repeat myself every round. Man created the principles, but man does not always live up to the principles. Therefore, for a better world, we have to be forced to comply with the principles that we have made. 10) Locke, Hobbes, how many more are there? - First I mentioned Hobbes then, you said that you did not mean him at all, I accepted that. Then, you said you meant Locke then, you say that Locke was a straw man, like I just randomly picked him. - John Locke's position on social contracts is much more in line with what I have been arguing- Bluesteel Second of all, Bluesteel’s definition of social contract is half of the definition. The rule of the social contract has to do with the consent of the governed. Just like in my world of total control, there is no government, people are controlled through ethics, and the people run the place through anarchy. As one sees, there is no social contract to be made since there is nothing in control of the governed since it is anarchy. 11) If Derrida was a Nihilist, it would be relevant to his saying. As one knows, Nihilists are not certain of anything; they argue known facts such as two plus two in hopes of getting people to question themselves. If everyone was like these people, nothing would be known. The world would also be a confusing place. So, if Derrida was a nihilist, how could he know what the “correct thing” was if the correct was uncertain to him. This is how it is relevant to his saying. 12) Matrix was a movie. Just because the humans chose to live in free will rather than sacrifice their free will for a greater good just demonstrates humans and selfishness. Main Argument: This last point that I made is very much about what this debate encompasses. My opponent knows that these principles are good for he never once questioned them. Due, to humans inabilities to do the right thing all of the time, I have designed a world where people live in compliance to the rules in anarchy; forced to do right according to the principles that man solidified for man to follow. In this world, nobody needs to know who is in charge of controlling the humans for humans are complying with the rules they set. My opponents main arguments has switched many times from the beginning, his main arguments now are that one humans want to do things freely and used a Matrix movie for an example… not the best source but I everyone can see where he comes from. Another argument he had was that since my world is not real, that it is inferior to the real world. This is not true. Free will has been proven not to exist as well as total control; this point is not relevant to the debate. My opponent also states that one has to experience the confusion of deciding of the correct path to be morally good. My opponent forgets that this condition is under free will rules. Under free will, one has to decide right and wrong instead of having the right one chosen for him. In the scenario my opponent gave to me, he said that from the principles, they cannot decide who lived and who died. As a matter of fact from the principles total control in compliance to the laws, the forced control performed better than free will. Everyone wants to do overall good anyway; this is why man made the principles, not a machine. Since humans cannot do everything in compliance to the rules that man himself has created, we should be in total control in compliance to the principles. Vote for Pro"	PRO	16
S6acab35f-A4e1b1976	Free will is an illusion	"Free will is merely an illusion. I understand that this is disturbing to many and will cause a visceral, adversarial reaction in some. It is disturbing for people to be told that they are not, have never been, and will never be in control of the wants that arise in consciousness and therefore the consequent actions. I blame no one for succumbing to the illusion of free will - the feeling that in any given circumstance, one could have chosen otherwise. Most people want to believe that their good deeds have merit and their morally praiseworthy actions are in fact morally praiseworthy. However, even a cursory examination reveals that this simply cannot be a condition that any logical person supposes. One cannot control what it is that they want - they cannot dictate their own impulses and tendencies. We have no idea what we intend to do until that intention itself comes into existence. In no way is it possible to be the author of one's own conscious desires. Perhaps you can decide what you will do next, but you certainly cannot decide what you will decide to do. ""Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as the star."" - Albert Einstein ""The first dogma which I came to disbelieve was that of free will. It seemed to me that all notions of matter were determined by the laws of dynamics and could not therefore be influenced by human wills."" - Bertrand Russell “How can we be “free” as conscious agents if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brain that we do not intend and of which we are entirely unaware?” - Sam Harris ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."" - Arthur Schopenhauer There are, of course, many deep implications of this - for the justice system, religion, morality, etc. However, that is not what I wish to debate here. I simply wish to contend that free will is a mere illusion in our current reality."	PRO	17
S9f9b50af-Abded129e	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"Thanks ASB. My opponent has no true advocacy position. He essentially is advocating that we should all have free will, but if we ever try to do something that is against the principles of ethics he outlines in Round 1, that something in our minds should ""zap"" us and prevent us from doing this particular action. That is not ""total control"" - that's partial control and partial free will. My opponent's position is tantamount to putting a dog collar on humans and having some supreme being ""shock"" us when we are about to do something bad, but otherwise granting us complete autonomy. Until my opponent actually argues for total control, I see no reason to continue extending my arguments in favor of free will, since my opponent's continual response is essentially ""free will still exists under 'total control.'"" In addition, it says nowhere that this is a hypothetical debate. If I prove that total control is impossible (because there is no God), I should win because that which exists is ""better"" than that which does not exist. Free will exists; total control does not exist. Therefore I have proven that free will is better than total control. Just four quick notes: 1. My opponent has clearly never read Rothbard. Rothbard believed in ""no government"" and criticized other libertarians for not being willing to go far enough to advocate a complete dissolution of the State. 2. Hobbes is a complete straw man; he is not the only contractarian, and I never cited him. John Locke's position on social contracts is much more in line with what I have been arguing. 3. When I said that we ""get no credit"" for making moral decisions when we have no free will, I didn't mean that we should act morally to get some reward. That is not the meaning of credit in this particular case. What I meant, and Derrida says, is that morality DOES NOT EXIST when our actions are forced. To act morally, we must go through the aporia of the undecidable - we must face that difficult moral choice and choose correctly. Being forced to act a certain way is meaningless. If a human chooses to abstain from killing, he or she is acting morally. If a human is forced (under total control) to abstain from killing, this action is meaningless. It is no different than a rock falling when we let it go. The rock is following a natural law (gravity). If humans abstained from killing because they were forced to, then they are just obeying an unbreakable law of nature. That is not morality. 4. Lastly, my opponent keeps saying that humans CANNOT act morally if ""no one is driving the car,"" meaning if we have free will. Yet, the vast majority of people disprove this assertion each day, by going about their everyday lives without raping, stealing, or murdering. Of course we can act morally, even with free will. Why else did the organization my opponent cites bother putting together a list of ethical behaviors unless they believed that humans could and would follow these recommended ethical principles?

Sda24f625-Ab7d243ac	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	"Thank you so much for this debate, it has been a great experience, and a wonderful time! This is the last round so I will have to sum up my concluding remarks I would like to clarify my last point, because it may have come across fuzzy Why I stated ""one may assume you should have stated COMPLETE ACCURACY' allow me to clear up why I was thrown off. Your statements ""Yes, that should really go without saying as the word accuracy, itself, means without error."" ""God may know the future, and may be able to know with accuracy what will happen but it doesn't mean things must happen that way"" WHICH IS SAYING God may know without error what will happen, but it does not mean it will happen that way. (WHICH IMPLIES) GOD MAY KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT IT DOESNT MEAN HE KNOWS EVERYTHING. This is a dodgy argument where you're trying to defend both sides. I'll have to take that as you saying that god doesn't know which seems like that is contradictory to your following statement. ""The difference would be that God would know if your plans are going to change, or if you just decide not to go and put it off until tomorrow. You are still free to make those choices, God just knows which choice you are going to make and whether you'll change them or not."" //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// I think I may have missed my mark on my explanation of why I believe this is wrong YOUR STATEMENT ""There are also instances in the Scriptures where God had planned to do something, but relented and didn't follow through. For instance, ""after Jonah witnessed to the Ninevites, God did not follow through on their destruction due to the fact that they repented of their wickedness (Jonah 3). God, of course, knew that the Ninevites would repent when Jonah went and revealed their sinfulness to them, but had they not repented they would have been destroyed."")"" I said in this example; god is seemingly always relenting from enforcing punishments IN EVERY INSTANCE that a fork in the road may lead to a destructive or constructive path, in your view god is relenting punishment for all of us, all the time."" To accurately described my point I should have stated, God is always (relenting, or continuing) To (punish, or reward) IN EVERY INSTANCE. If I do something for which I am going to repent for, God wouldn't be considered to be ""not following through with his plans"", because I repented. He would be considered to be following through on his original plan to not give punishment for, what has been repented for, without exception. This is our last round so I hope that it is understood that if this was supposed to be a scripture that proves that god can change his mind, then this only proves my point as to how god must follow through. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Now for some more conflicting statements ""Humans are inherently moral, and rational creatures, with the ability to reason and understand the world around us."" Here you say are inherently morality and rationality ""Children must be taught to understand morality"" Here you try to not consider Children Humans, and say morality is acquired through being taught. (""There is nothing conflicting in my statements. Humans have the inherent ability to reason within ourselves, but we still must be taught right from wrong. That's why we have parents."" Here you say we inherit the ability to reason, but your explanation of morality is if we are lucky enough to have parents then they can teach us. What if our parents are morally bankrupt, or there are no parents to speak of. Then where do you inherit morality, NOWHERE. ANY WHO THIS IS CONFLICTING BECAUSE it goes from ""HUMANS ARE INHERENTLY MORAL"" TO, "" WE MUST BE TAUGHT."" ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// More of your conflicting statements This is your response after I asked do dogs have free will ""Dogs do not have free will because of any moral implications. We do. But they still have free choice. Even if you are training them not to chew on your slippers, they still have the choice whether to obey and be rewarded, or to disobey and get another shock (or to be put outside)."" Then your statements change after I bring up cannibalistic tribes ""This isn't about morality, this is about free choice. No matter what your morality, you still have choices you can make. Even if you have differing opinions of what is good or not, you still have the same choice I do."" It seems like you are trying to use the concept of morality as you see fit. I brought up the cannibalistic tribes to convey the fact, Morality is up in the air, and is a luck of birth. It might as well just be considered a way of identifying one group from another. Mainly it is about supporting a group that will advance your life span. It isn't about being a cannibal it is about surviving in a location where the only morality there is to know is the morality you LEARN FROM YOUR PERENTS!!!!!. I would love to leave Morality, out of the free will out of the equation. It is you that is trying to save your theory with the weak argument of saying dogs don't have morals, therefore they aren't free. Then I bring up Cannibalistic tribes and you throw out Morality as necessary for humans free will, and you try to defend ""Free Choice"" ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// My reasoning behind the cookie jar scenario YOUR STATEMENT ""With the example about the cookie jar, you are actually helping to make my case. The boy had a choice of whether to go for the cookie or not. It is irrelevant if one boy was punished and the other not. They both made the decision to take a cookie against their parents' wishes. One was punished because he was caught doing it."" I find you to be a very nice, and honest person given your take on this argument. My rationality behind this analogy was presenting the injustice that some are dealt with, Allergies, Neurological disorders. My position was that the parents knew that both boys were going for a cookie, and only one gets punished. (APPARENTLY ITS DUE TO THE FALL) ANOTHER SLIGHTLY RELATED THING IT SEEMS LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO SAY THAT YOUR STATEMENT ""Even if you have differing opinions of what is good or not, you still have the same choice I do. If I believe A is right and you believe B is right, I might choose A and you might choose B because we both consider ourselves to be moral people. However, no one is perfect -- I might occasionally choose B and you might occasionally choose A because we don't particularly feel like abiding by our morals that day."" FIRST YOU THREW MORALITY OUT OF THE EQUATION FOR FREE WILL, AND DUBBED IT FREE CHOICE. YOUR STATEMENT ""There may be situations in which we don't have a choice, but that doesn't take away from our free will. Sometimes there is no choice to make, or no good choice, but we are forced into the situation. Our choice in the matter is taken away from us."" NOW YOUR TRYING TO SAY YOU CAN HAVE FREE WILL EVEN IF THERE IS NO CHOICE, NO A NO B, NOTHING. IF I LOSE THIS THEN VOTERS ARE ADMITTING THAT FREE WILL = NO CHOICE THERE ARE ALOT OF WAYS TO GO ON THIS, AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON BUT AS THIS IS MY LAST ROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN SINCERELY THANK MY OPPONENT FOR THE CHANCE TO HEAR WHAT IS ON HIS MIND, AND WHAT MAY BE AN UNDERLYING TRUTH IN MANY CHRISTIANS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE VOTERS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR US OUT."	CON	19
S6acab37e-Ac87fc1f6	Free will is an illusion	"Free will is merely an illusion. I understand that this is disturbing to many and will cause a visceral, adversarial reaction in some. It is disturbing for people to be told that they are not, have never been, and will never be in control of the wants that arise in consciousness and therefore the consequent actions. I blame no one for succumbing to the illusion of free will - the feeling that in any given circumstance, one could have chosen otherwise. Most people want to believe that their good deeds have merit and their morally praiseworthy actions are in fact morally praiseworthy. However, even a cursory examination reveals that this simply cannot be a condition that any logical person supposes. One cannot control what it is that they want - they cannot dictate their own impulses and tendencies. We have no idea what we intend to do until that intention itself comes into existence. In no way is it possible to be the author of one's own conscious desires. Perhaps you can decide what you will do next, but you certainly cannot decide what you will decide to do. ""Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as the star."" - Albert Einstein ""The first dogma which I came to disbelieve was that of free will. It seemed to me that all notions of matter were determined by the laws of dynamics and could not therefore be influenced by human wills."" - Bertrand Russell “How can we be “free” as conscious agents if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brain that we do not intend and of which we are entirely unaware?” - Sam Harris ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."" - Arthur Schopenhauer There are, of course, many deep implications of this - for the justice system, religion, morality, etc. However, that is not what I wish to debate here. I simply wish to contend that free will is a mere illusion in our current reality."	PRO	20
S1854a9c7-A9995fc95	Free Will	"I will attempt to argue against the idea of free will. Free will is a crucial component to many ideologies, religions and beliefs. I am not suggesting people cannot be responsible or that certain things in the universe are not chaotic in nature. There is a BIG difference between saying something is uncaused versus it is caused by this thing that is a will and that the will we are speaking of is free. I am not suggesting that certain actions are not more autonomous (caused more by factors within the body) than not (coercion or forced action) First I will try and suggest that a will itself, as something separate and independent of the physical world yet is able to stimulate the physical word 'magically' (hey if it isn't science based and not God caused why not call it what it is = supernatural or magic (magic is shorter) ) is absurd. To suggest a will controls my body's action one has to be ready to answer the following questions: What part of my body (or what part of my brain?) is the will attached? How does it know which body to attach itself? How does it know which actions, desires, thoughts, behaviors cells, molecules, atoms, etc. to control? Can we gain and lose it? (if so how?) How does this not fall victim to occham's razor? Or argumentum ad absurdum? How do the wills keep from sharing a body or having a body without a will? Then the idea of a ""free"" anything has to avoid just being considered ""magical."" This ""thing"" that exists is exempt from all other rules of the universe. How can one know that this thing (which is undetectable) is exempt from the rules of the universe other than we hope what we see (people's actions and my actions) are uncaused therefore a product of free will? Since then the burden of proof lies on a the person suggesting a new or extra entity exists, and there are a great deal of absurd consequences to accept if a person adopts the position of free will, I'm going to go and say it doesn't exist. But then again I am wrong about a lot of stuff and you only get better by being proved wrong so thank you for anyone willing to teach me some things on this topic"	CON	21
S6acab35f-Aa1f5b304	Free will is an illusion	Thanks for your really interesting replies, this should be a great discussion. On the common sense argument for free will: I agree that ‘common sense’, or what seems to be the case pre-theoretically, can be wrong. The earth is not flat, etc… My argument is an attempt to shift the burden of proof to those rejecting free will. Pre-theoretically, we seem free, so we default to free will until shown otherwise. An analogy would be external world skepticism. Pre-theoretically, we seem to be in touch with reality. We may not be. But, we should default to our experience being veridical until someone proves we are stuck in the Matrix. So, the purpose of this argument is: if the argumentation on free will vs. determinism ends in a draw, free will should be endorsed. On the moral responsibility argument for free will: Yes, I am arguing that an ought implies a can. More specifically, a cannot implies an ought not, but I don’t think I will need to quibble. You reply: sometimes an ought occurs without a can, as in the case of the soldier/medic. I don’t agree. Either the medic really can treat the soldier, in which case he ought to. Or, the medic really can’t, in which case he ought not. Whether the medic can or cannot really treat the soldier is murky in your illustration. May I change the illustration a bit? The medic is handcuffed to a tree, so he literally cannot help the soldier. In this case, he ought not anymore. Now, the medic is freed from handcuffs, and able to reach the soldier, so now he ought to help him. Fortunately, there is no need to quibble on this issue either, since you agree that the loss of free will implies the loss of moral responsibility. So, the real disagreement occurs elsewhere. You think the loss of moral responsibility does not sink your view. I do. Without moral responsibility there is no criminal responsibility, so the edifices of society lack foundation. One may say: so what, we will build other structures. Ok, but then we ask: why did blind physical processes give rise to human societies that were founded on the bizarre and incorrect view that moral responsibility exists? It seems unlikely. And then another awkward question: how will we change the fabric of society, given that we lack free will. Ultimately, the same blind physical processes that gave rise to a ‘free will founded’ society will cause the existence of a ‘no free will founded’ society at precisely the time when epiphenomenal abstract reasoning concluded that free will does not exist. That is too coincidental to be likely. The causal processes of blind quantum frothing is in no way privy to, or responsive to, the epiphenomenal musings of macro objects such as humans. Then we have to draw deeper implications: not just moral responsibility fails, but the reactive attitudes as well. Praise and blame, gratitude and shaming, condemnation, being appalled, feeling contempt, all make no sense anymore. Neither does pride in one’s accomplishments, or guilt, or many other emotions. Again we ask: why are our reactive attitudes set up in such a way as to presume moral responsibility, when in fact there is none. Why would the brain waste resources on such a delusion? On the evolutionary argument: yes, free will could be an epiphenomenal by-product of fitness enhancing brain processes, just as the weight of a polar bears coat is a by-product of the fitness enhancing warmth of the polar bears coat. But then we start asking awkward questions again: given that our mental life is epiphenomenal, why should it be commensurate with how we act? For example, why does my brain process leading to McDonalds eating behaviour subvene the exact belief/desire states that would also have caused me to eat McDonalds, if those mental states were efficacious. Why doesn’t the brain process leading to McDonalds eating behaviour subvene the belief that a teapot is floating around the solar system, and a desire to taste a cloud, leading to me acting by eating at McDonalds? It is all just a remarkable coincidence that our mental states and choices exactly correspond to what the brain is doing anyway. The more likely option is that our choices caused our behaviour, which is the free will view. On the epistemic argument, I packed too much into a small sentence. The argument is that knowledge is justified true belief, where the true belief is caused by the justification, not other non-rational forces. For example, the juror has the true belief that John is guilty, and the juror is justified in arriving at this view based on the evidence presented at trial. But, the juror flips a coin and decides to come to her guilty/innocent verdict based on the coin flip. The coin flips ‘guilty’. The juror has justified true belief, but her reasons did not cause her true belief, so it is not knowledge. Likewise, your argument against free will is based on reasons, and let us say it is a true belief that ‘free will is false’. You do not know free will is false, since, on your view, mental states do not cause beliefs. Rather, blind brain processes, which are in no way privy to, or beholden to, the epiphenomenal abstract reasoning going on in your mind, are causing your conclusions. If determinism is true, you were determined from before birth, based on blind physical processes, to argue against free will right now. If a mad scientist re-wired your brain chemistry a bit, you would start to argue in support of free will. The reasons your provide yourself matter nothing, since they do not influence you. And, the reasons against determinism I am presently providing also matter nothing, since blind chemical processes entirely determine your brain structure tomorrow, and those blind chemical processes do not alter based on reasons. On the free will to want what we want, we trace our character back to a self-forming action at some time in our past. Self-forming actions typically occur in genuine 50/50 cases, when there is equal reason to perform two conflicting acts. Indeterministic quantum processes select one of the choices, and our free will supervenes upon these indeterministic processes, leading the behaviour to be indeterministic, though caused by physical forces, but also having an agent cause, hence free will. You object: at the moment of self-forming actions, we are actually determined to choose path A. Well, I don’t think that fits with quantum physics. At best, the foe of free will says the probability of path A is fixed by quantum forces, so we don’t have free will. That is fine. I add: free will supervenes upon those quantum forces, and also causes the behaviour. So, we get free will. I will add: your argument takes the cause of our ‘wanting’ to be unconscious and uncontrolled brain processes. But, our wanting is not random, it is a logical extension of our beliefs/desires. As I mentioned, I did not have a random ‘want’ to start a discussion in the movies thread, but instead my wanting to discuss free will is logically connected to my character. If my wanting was only caused by unconscious brain processes, and unconscious brain processes are not logical/rational but chemical, it is mysterious why the ‘wants’ that pop up are usually logically aligned with my beliefs/desires. It is as if my beliefs/desires cause my wants! Why not just acknowledge that our beliefs/desires cause our wants!	CON	22
S6acab35f-Af384ae86	Free will is an illusion	"Thanks a lot for your well-thought out and reasoned argument, it is much appreciated. I am happy to agree with that definition of free will, with emphasis on the notion that a being is free so long as they could have done otherwise at a given juncture in life. Let's go through your points one-by-one: Argument 1: Common Sense Intuition I would say that asserting the truth of a concept based solely, primarily, or partially on the notion that it is common sense is a very inadequate way to look at the world. The following are just a few examples of notions once considered to be held in the ""common sense"" arena that are clearly no longer valid: The world is flat Geocentrism Washing hands doesn't prevent disease Continents are unmovable ""Unfortunately, it seems that our common sense notion of free will is flawed regardless of one’s opinion on determinism: free will is impossible in a world that is determined, undetermined, or anywhere in between"" - Brandy Jo Newell, Indiana Undergraduate Journal of Cognitive Science My counterargument here is not at all to say that common sense is never accurate. Rather, I am trying to illustrate that over the course of human history, it has been proven that ""common sense"" is not always true. As such, I feel it should be removed from the list of arguments. Argument 2: An ought implies a can, and a cannot implies an ought not. There are two pieces to this argument. First, you appeal to Kant's infamous OIC argument (A). Second, you state that it follows that, since free will fails, moral responsibility fails, etc. A) OIC As I said, this argument of yours appears to be a formulation of Kant's. Though he is undoubtedly one of the most respected philosophers of all time, there are an ample number of philosophers that disagree with ought-implies-can (OIC). There seem to be a plethora of counterexamples to the OIC tenet, so we will first start with some definitions (provided with the aid of Moti Mizrahi, The City University of New York): 'Ought' is typically used to connote some sort of moral obligation or duty. An example would be the statement, ""A husband ought not commit infidelity"". In most literature, especially that of philosophical variety, 'ought to' and 'is obligated to' are typically used interchangeably. As for 'can', I most agree with the definition of ""what an agent is capable of doing within the limits of her physical and mental abilities in the circumstances."" Your contention translates as - If A ought to do X, A can do X. Consider the case of a soldier, a medic, and their commander. Suppose the soldier has been wounded. Further suppose that the commander instructs the medic to treat the soldier's wound. Then, imagine a conversation such as the following: Commander: “Medic, tend to that wound!” Medic: “I cannot, commander.” Commander: “What do you mean you can’t do it? You’re the medic of this platoon and I just gave you an order!” Medic: “Commander, I know I should but I can't."" In this hypothetical, the medic is paralyzed by fear because of the heavy surrounding fire. With that, he is unable to provide aid. Both the commander and the medic know that the latter ought to treat the wounded soldier. So, it’s true that the medic ought to treat the wounded soldier, by virtue of his capacity, even though it’s false that he can actually do so. If this is correct, we seem to have a case where the fact that the medic can treat the soldier does not follow from the statement that the medic ought to treat the soldier. It seems we have established at least one case in which OIC fails. B) Failure of free will -> failure of moral responsibility If I understand at least the start of this deduction, I absolutely agree here. Without free will, the notion of moral responsibility certainly does fail. This is why the final line of my initial argument was, ""There are, of course, many deep implications of this - for the justice system, religion, morality, etc. However, that is not what I wish to debate here. I simply wish to contend that free will is a mere illusion in our current reality."" With that said, just because a lack of free will would imply the evacuation of moral responsibility and that a world without moral responsibility may seem askew, incomprehensible, or downright silly, that doesn't mean in any way, shape, or form that free will need not exist. Argument 3: In general, evolutionary processes select for traits with adaptive benefit to the organism. As a staunch supporter of evolutionary theory, I could not agree more with this statement. However, I don't at all agree with what follows. Whether or not free will truly exists, I would agree with you that an overwhelming majority of humans think and act as if they do. However, who are we to say whether evolution has selected for this notion of free will to be objectively true, subjectively true, or completely false? What if the illusion of free will is the precursor to a neurophysiological chain of events that results in increased resources devoted to mating which, in turn, leads to an increase in the proliferation of the genes that give rise to the illusion in the first place? I don't think there are many people who would argue that human agents in any way act according to free will in their dreams. Thus, by your logic, dreams have no causal efficacy and, further, no adaptive benefit. I also don't think there are many people who would argue that dreams exist. You are entitled to your own opinions regarding the purpose of dreams (though many scientists don't think they serve a purpose (Scientific American)), put you cannot deny that in some way, evolutionary processes have selected for organisms using resources to further non-causally efficacious epiphenomenal experiences. Argument 4: beliefs are considered knowledge when reasons cause those beliefs I'm not sure this is a stance that can be unilaterally held, depending on your definitions of 'reason' and 'knowledge'. If I believe that God created the universe based on the reason that a priest told me, does that make it knowledge? If I believe that it only rains on Tuesdays based on the reason that I've only observed rain on Tuesdays, does that make it knowledge? Surely there must be some sort of evidence or truth requirement in transforming a belief into knowledge. You state that beliefs are not knowledge ""when blind processes cause those beliefs."" You might argue (and I might agree) that the priest/God example reflects a sort of blind faith and, thus, should not be considered knowledge. However, the rain example is by no stretch of the imagination representative of a blind process. It is a belief, backed up by observation and unwavering empirical evidence, used to create ""knowledge"". As I run out of characters here, I'll make one last comment regarding to your answer as to you having the will to want to have this debate. We can happily discuss the remaining in future rounds. If you take the stance that the ""want"" was created over the course of many years of thinking what you value, I would ask you to more closely examine what it is that you value and why it is that you value it. The further you drill down into notions like this, the closer you get to realizing that these values were the result of processes, whether on the molecular level or the nature/nurture level, over which you have no control. Suppose you want to have this debate because you value defending your viewpoints. I would ask - why do you have this viewpoint and why do you value defending it? You might say you value defending it because you've spent intellectual energy refining your opinion in the pursuit of enlightenment and enjoy logical discourse. To that I would ask why it is that you enjoy logical discourse. You seem more than capable of tracing a thought process like this to its roots and I'd be very interested to see you trace something all the way back to its genesis without arriving at an unconscious factor."

S6acab37e-A5cdee34a	Free will is an illusion	"Thanks for this. Let's go step-by-step: ""I must point out that the quote was taken entirely out of context."" I have read the book this comes from, The Wanting Seed. I do not at all believe the quote was taken out of context. If you would like to argue it does, please provide hard evidence beyond mere conjecture requiring our readers ""read between the lines"". ""if I were trying to make an argument against free will, Burgess would not make my shortlist of people to quote"" Who would make that list? ""I don't yet see any metaphysical evidence that shows me how or why the process from observation to reaction is not under our control"" What proven, empirical, scientific evidence do you see that shows the ""process from observation to reaction"" is irrefutably under our control? If you are going to purport that humans have a certain superpower not held by any other animal despite the sharing of a huge majority of DNA, especially with our closest ancestors, and absent the classic ""common sense"" / ""I feel like I have a free will"" argument, I feel you should be required to demonstrate as such. ""the emotions attached to the horrible event are stored in the child's brain for the child to reference in the future,"" By any logical stretch, this point proves my side of the argument rather than your own. The newborn doesn't, on their own volition, decide to store information surrounding the experience in their memory. The rock experience is recorded in the newborn's neural pathways (and perhaps Bayesian mind) where information is stored that can be accessed in the future. This information includes data on the color, shape, texture, and weight of the rock as well as the speed with which it hit them, the feeling on the moment of impact, and, of course, the accompanying pain. This information is encoded in the memory and grouped with any other past or future experiences with objects of similar nature in similar situations. As the newborn develops, their brain will be able to instinctively react to future rocks. This is where instincts (innate, typically fixed patterns of behavior in animals in response to certain stimuli, absent agency) come from. Even if you tried to argue that the newborn does, in some way, have control over the information and/or emotion encoded in its memory from an experience like this, how does the newborn decide what information to store? How does the newborn even decide it was a positive or negative experience? How does the newborn make the judgment that pain is better than pleasure (or vice versa)? How does the newborn file away this experience for future recall along with ""rocks"" as opposed to ""elephants"", ""space ships"", or ""chair lifts""? I don't think any logical person, remotely familiar with neurophysiology or psychology would claim these things were willed by conscious agency. ""Emotions are a complex system of synapses at work in conjunction with fluids being sent throughout the body, it's nothing more than our sense of touch, but we tend to attach pleasant or unpleasant or neutral attitudes on those emotions,"" Shockingly, you're again proving my point. Emotions are purely physiological. When people feel they are being influenced by emotions, or tapping into them, they are simply reacting in a purely mechanical way to stimuli. ""It deals with the idea that just the fact that we realize our emotions do not control us, may help us to have a better understanding of ourselves as individuals. If you find the time to read up on it, give it a looksey, "" It is funny that you cite this article regarding self-awareness as some sort of proof of free will, when it starkly contradicts your rock/newborn example vis-a-vis its developmental timeline. Interesting? Sure. Proof that all it describes is not a complex illusion? Not remotely. ""Of course what one might consider to be reasonable, others may not, the reasonable or logical decisions pertain only to ones self."" I could not agree more and wish others on this forum would concur. ""I have my own emotional reference table, based off of situations and observations unique to me so far as I can see"" I agree here, but I would ask: ""by what token of free will have you consciousness authored the way in which your emotional reference table was formed and formatted?"" Was it it shaped by a rock experience when you were a newborn? Unless you possessed telekinetic powers as a child, the rock hurling toward you was unlikely to have been doing so as a result if your own volition. Your reaction and subsequent storage of information, memory, and experience, were equally not of your own volition. -- Any close, or even cursory, exploration of one's consciousness and self experience should reveal the free will is but a mere illusion. You have no more control over the next word that comes out of your mouth/keyboard as you do mine. You cannot be the author of your own conscious desires and, though you can sometimes decide what you are going to do, you can never decide what you will decide you will do.

Why does it matter so much to bluesteel with what will be in total control, yes, I said what not who. With everyone falling into compliance with the principles, I do not have to mention what is in control for it does not matter when everyone is in compliance to the principles. Thoughts are first, control follows. Example: I want to sleep in, (thoughts, my well being) but I am forced out of the bed to comply with other the other principles since in the end I respect the well being of others than my own. 1) God does not exist: Where did this argument come from? I never mentioned God in this debate. 2) Even if he does, he is definitely not benevolent. *God does not exist* -never said he did. Proof 1: My opponent gave up trying to prove that total control is wrong, he is now trying to prove why total control is impossible. Nobody said anything about possible or impossible, this debate is circumstantial. I'm guessing this is how most debates work on debate.org; most of these debates are ""what if..."" debates. My opponent keeps on giving me different BOP's, this one he just gave me, I'm do not need to fulfill for my opponent thinks that I'm arguing for God.

As you see, in a world of free will, everything falls apart for everyone does what one wants to do. Therefore, even Hobbes thinks anarchy would not work. Under a world of free will, anarchy is not logically possible. Anarchy is said to be man’s last destination, according to Marx, but in a world ruled by free will, this is not possible. Total Control: My opponent believes that total control is only done at the controller’s will. This is wrong for some things that one wants to do, they can be forced to do it. Example: If I wanted to eat steak, total control could force me to eat steak. I am still being forced to do something. Driving car analogy: Humans cannot drive themselves to be in total compliance to the universal principles that humans themselves have created. My analogy to driving the car stands. Somalia Like I said earlier, the dictator was a human, the human dictator did not rule in compliance to the universal principles so this reference should be discarded. Derrida My last statement still stands, why should humans be worried about getting credit for doing what they are supposed to do? Mindless drones Total Control does not force one to think, but it forces our actions in compliance to the principles, humans have made rules for them to follow, but we do not always follow these rules. We want to follow these rules for we made them, so what better way than total control. Karl Marx… Was an atheist, so I doubt that he would even believe there was a God anyway. Another thing, my opponent still thinks that total control forces one to do what they do not want to do. Total control can force one to do what they want to do as well. Existentialism I did answer his statement about life with meaning. Who cares about credit for doing the right thing? One should do the right thing because it is what one is supposed to do not because one gets rewarded for it. The meaning of life is not being rewarded for doing what one is supposed to do."	PRO	25
S6acab37e-Adec29fa8	Free will is an illusion	"I fear that a huge portion of Con's argument is based on a complete misunderstanding of my point. I never said we can't control our impulses insofar as succumbing to their influence, I simply stated that we cannot dictate what impulses arise in our consciousness in the first place. Further, I would agree that we do not ever ""have control of our choice to act..."" The reason most people believe in free will is because they feel as though they have the agency to act ""reasonable, or impulsive."" On the note of reason, I would ask Con what it means to act reasonable and where he/she gets the definition of reason from. I would ask why it is that he/she likes to act reasonably (or not) in given situations i.e. why is reason valued. Perhaps Con realizes their definition of reason grew out of unconscious processes. Perhaps, though, they feel that it is something they've honed over the years as a result of trial-and-error or learning from mistakes or anything along those lines. Still, I would ask what the genesis of those mistakes were, why Con considered them to be mistakes or learning experiences, and how he/she chose to apply the lessons learned to future behavior. Ultimately, if Con is honest with his/herself, they will reach one of two related realizations, or both: Once they trace back far enough the source of their conscious desires, they will realize that they grew from unconscious processes over which they have no control. The only possible causes of Con not reaching this realization would be a failure to trace back his/her thoughts and desires to a significant starting point or simply being ignorant of the fact that, at some point, there was a starting point over which they had no control. As I don't think Con is a person who tends to be illogical or ignorant, I feel this is a valuable thought experiment Another option would be tracing desires and wants and impulses back to a combination of genetic predispositions and upbringing i.e. nature/nurture. Since it is universally accepted by scientists that all we are is a product of nature and nurture, I would hope Con realizes that he/she had absolutely no control over either of these aspects of their development Though the philosophy community might be split among libertarians, compatibilists, and determinists, the scientific community is not. ""You,’ your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. Who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons … although we appear to have free will, in fact, our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that."" - Francis Crick ""Take a moment to think about the context in which your next decision will occur: You did not pick your parents or the time and place of your birth. You didn't choose your gender or most of your life experiences. You had no control whatsoever over your genome or the development of your brain. And now your brain is making choices on the basis of preferences and beliefs that have been hammered into it over a lifetime - by your genes, your physical development since the moment you were conceived, and the interactions you have had with other people, events, and ideas. Where is the freedom in this? Yes, you are free to do what you want even now. But where did your desires come from?” - Sam Harris ""The experience of willing an act arises from interpreting one's thought as the cause of the act. Conscious will is thus experienced as a function of the priority, consistency, and exclusivity of the thought about the action. The thought must occur before the action, be consistent with the action, and not be accompanied by other causes. An experiment illustrating the role of priority found that people can arrive at the mistaken belief that they have intentionally caused an action that in fact they were forced to perform when they are simply led to think about the action just before its occurrence."" - Wegner & Wheatly ""Our minds are designed to distort our perception of choice and that this distortion is an important feature (not simply a bug) of our cognitive machinery."" - Michael Shermer Take the following example from Scientific American: At a restaurant recently I faced many temptations: a heavy stout beer, a buttery escargot appetizer, a marbled steak, cheesecake. The neural networks in my brain that have evolved to produce the emotion of hunger for sweet and fatty foods, which in our ancestral environment were both rare and sustaining, were firing away to get me to make those selections. In competition were signals from other neural networks that have evolved to make me care about my future health, in particular how I view my body image for status among males and appeal to females and how sluggish I feel after a rich meal and the amount of exercise I will need to counter it. In the end, I ordered a light beer, salmon and a salad with vinaigrette dressing and split a mildly rich chocolate cake with my companion. Was I free to make these choices? According to neuroscientist Sam Harris in his luminous new book Free Will (Free Press, 2012), I was not. “Free will is an illusion,” Harris writes. “Our wills are simply not of our own making.” Every step in the causal chain above is fully determined by forces and conditions not of my choosing, from my evolved taste preferences to my learned social status concerns—causal pathways laid down by my ancestors and parents, culture and society, peer groups and friends, mentors and teachers, and historical contingencies going all the way back to my birth and before. Neuroscience supports this belief. The late physiologist Benjamin Libet noted in EEG readings of subjects engaged in a task requiring them to press a button when they felt like it that half a second before the decision was consciously made the brain's motor cortex lit up. Research has extended the time between subcortical brain activation and conscious awareness to a full seven to 10 seconds. A new study found activity in a tiny clump of 256 neurons that enabled scientists to predict with 80 percent accuracy which choice a subject would make before the person himself knew. Very likely, just before I became consciously aware of my menu selections, part of my brain had already made those choices. “Thoughts and intentions emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control,” Harris concludes. “We do not have the freedom we think we have.” I would also urge you to read about experiments (e.g. https://www.wired.com...) where it is shown that scientific brain scanners are able to know what you decisions will be before you *think* you make them. You bring up the example of the rock - I would be very curious how you associate standing still as a rock flies toward you with being rational. Nonetheless, if the event happens instantaneously before you are able to think, consider, ponder, debate, or analyze the situation, how can you consider it to be a free decision? I never said that one's body and mind are not in control of themselves or each other, I'm contending that given a particular situation (e.g. rock flying at face), one could not have willfully acted in another way. Yes, I do argue that we have no control over our emotions, but no more or less than any other processes that govern our lives. ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.” - Arthur Schopenhauer “You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it. You are the storm...You can do what you decide to do — but you cannot decide what you will decide to do.” - Sam Harris “We're a government that believes in everybody having the illusion of free will.” - Anthony Burgess Have a great day!"

Sda24f625-A75c4513b	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	As this is a continuation of a previous debate [1], I will make a more sophisticated case for free will with the Christian God. After I make my case, I will address the Instigator's arguments and, characters permitting, a few things from our previous debate. God is all-knowing. He knows everything, even what will happen in the future (1 John 3:20, Daniel 2:45). He knows our deepest desires and feelings. He created us, so He literally knows everything about us. There are also times in which God has set things into motion, which could not be changed. He chose Jeremiah from the womb to be his prophet (Jeremiah 1:5), and even sending Jesus to the cross was a part of His plan (2 Timothy 1:9). However, these were exceptions and not the rule. When God created Adam and Eve, he planted a tree in the Garden of Eden called the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which He forbade them to eat from. He knew they would eat from it anyway, but He didn't force them do it. They had the free will not to eat from the tree, and didn't have to do it. God knew they would anyway. (Genesis 2-3). God may know the future, and may be able to know with accuracy what will happen but it doesn't mean things must happen that way. For example, if I know you're going to the store tomorrow your plans may chance and you end up not going. Going to the store wasn't set in stone just because you knew you were going to go. The difference would be that God would know if your plans are going to change, or if you just decide not to go and put it off until tomorrow. You are still free to make those choices, God just knows which choice you are going to make and whether you'll change them or not. There are also instances in the Scriptures where God had planned to do something, but relented and didn't follow through. For instance, after Jonah witnessed to the Ninevites, God did not follow through on their destruction due to the fact that they repented of their wickedness (Jonah 3). God, of course, knew that the Ninevites would repent when Jonah went and revealed their sinfulness to them, but had they not repented they would have been destroyed. They were free not to repent. Our sin will also condemn us to an eternity in Hell. God could not hold us accountable for our sin if we were not responsible for committing them. We would not be responsible for committing them if we had no choice whether or not to commit them. So as you can see, the existence of God does not preclude having a free will. Knowing what will happen is not the same as forcing something to happen. I will now respond to the Instigator's argument: Whether or not animals have a free will is a complicated question. Humans and animals are different; humans are inherently moral and rational creatures, with the ability to reason and understand the world around us. Children must be taught to understand morality; if you put candy in one bowl and broccoli in another bowl in front of a child, they will go right for the candy unless they have been taught to go for the broccoli because it's better for them. A dog, on the other hand, can never be taught morality. Every animal is different; some have a preference for toys, some have a preference for dog treats, some have a preference for slippers. A dog can be taught to avoid chewing on slippers, but not because chewing on someone else's slippers is wrong. The dog learns not to chew on your slippers because you don't like it, and you control the food, treats, and shock collar. A dog does have free will, in that if you put two pairs of slippers in front of him, he can choose which one to chew up. However, if you bought the dog a chew toy, he may decide to chew your slippers until you train him not to. Or he may just find the chew toy more appealing and chew on it. Dogs do not have free will because of any moral implications. We do. But they still have free choice. Even if you are training them not to chew on your slippers, they still have the choice whether to obey and be rewarded, or to disobey and get another shock (or to be put outside). I must confess I'm not sure what most of the rest of your argument has to do with the topic at hand. You seem to indicate that because we can choose in the first place, we have no choice but to choose, and therefore our very choices are not freely made because we are forced to make them. Please correct me if I'm wrong. The problem with this philosophy is that there's no inherent punishment for making any choices, just by virtue that we are choosing. If a bank robber holds a gun to a bank teller's head and tells her to put the money in the bag, she still has a free choice. She can disobey and take a bullet to the head, or comply and give the robber his money. No jury would convict that bank teller because she acquiesced under duress. If she hadn't complied, she would have been killed. However, even though some choices have negative consequences, there is no negative consequence just by virtue of being able to choose. In fact, the basic ability to choose helps us to grow and mature. No one is born a Theist. it is more likely to be born an atheist, because you have to learn about a particular religious discipline, or question your existence in the universe in order to realize there is a God. There is every chance an atheist can become a Theist. God just knows who will come to believe and who won't. He doesn't force belief on anyone. He doesn't force anyone to love Him. That would negate the very essence of love. What makes love so special is that we choose to love someone. Would you want someone to love you because they were forced to? I fail to see how it is possible for a baby to pass the MCAT test, or any other test. You have to learn about the discipline before you can hope to pass a fundamental test in that discipline. While my faith in God makes me pro-life, I am also pro-life because of science and reason. This is actually an irrelevant question because whether or not a baby who dies goes to Heaven has nothing to do with free will. It's always sad when a child dies. There is good Biblical evidence to suppose that babies who die go to Heaven, but if they do, so what? That doesn't give us a right to kill unborn children just because they'll probably go to Heaven. We have no right to kill any innocent human. But again, this is irrelevant. In your last round of the previous debate, you mentioned someone with a chicken allergy. Someone with that allergy can still choose to eat chicken if they wish, but they must be prepared to deal with the consequences. A teenager who has a habit of breaking out after eating chocolate is still free to do so. Some teenagers are willing to risk a pimple to consume chocolate. We all have choices, and some consequences are more dangerous and long-lasting than others. That doesn't mean we are not free to choose. I look forward to our next round. [1] http://www.debate.org...

S15efddff-A8ab1cea1	God has free will.	"+++++++++++++++++ Conclusion: +++++++++++++++++ 1. Obviously, in this debate, Pro did not refute whatever I say in the previous round. Pro is going with his own definition of God that is Omnipotence. He says that an Omnipotence being can do anything yes I must admit that. But not a being with Omnipotence, Omni benevolence and Omniscience. I will illustrate this example in order to clear the confusion of the readers. God =Omni benevolence =Omnipotence =Omniscience Evil =Omnipotence =Omniscience (Possibly) =Malevolence Being X or whatever you want to call that (Not God or Evil) = Omnipotence Pro is claiming that being X has free will because it can do anything. Yes. But do you think being X is really God? As I have stated in my earlier round that God cannot sin since he is Omnibenevolent. Yes, what I say is true and valid because my opponent also admits that. He has no objection. He is claiming that the being X has free will. He also drops that God does not have free will because he has only one choice. He says that Omnipotent being can drop his attributes to become being X and have free will. Let""s us look at this further. Carbon Dioxide- CO2. Oxygen-O2 Carbon-C He is trying to ask carbon dioxide to release its Oxygen then it will become free. So, only C is left. He is trying to say that C is carbon dioxide. No, that is carbon. He is trying to falsely equivocate whatever Omnipotent being is God. 2. I have explained that God cannot have free will because free will is described as the ability to act in one""s freedom because God is powerful. Unfortunately, my opponent has no refuted the possibility that God was prevented by evil to do something. Since he also admits the Holy Bible is true, which means evil also exists. We can see that in this debate, the only reference that we use is Holy Bible but not any other books. 3. I have, again, proven that the creator (God) of free will did not have free will. If HE has given any human free will which means the man can act bad or good. He has no control over. HE is also predestined by its own knowledge of its future actions. Which means God has no free will because of he knows what HE will do in the future. If he does not do it, then he will be wrong. 4. Pro says that I have dropped his case and remains un-rebutted. Is that true? No, because whatever Con is irrelevant to the debate. It is no value for me to attack that. A few mistakes that I make are that misplace the order of the position of Creation in the Genesis. In the beginning, I define God as Omnipotence, Omni benevolence and Omniscience. I did not define him as Omnipotence alone. 5. Free will: The ability to do something"". If God has free will, then he can do it. If God has no free will then he cannot do it. In my parts, God has no power to act because of the cancellation of power. Just to remind the readers that Evils are Angels before. That said, they are also powerful and almost same as God. 6. Pro is also debating truism. This means he is having all the advantages and I was set in a bad position. Onto the voters now, we, on the whole, have seen that Pro is dropping whatever I say in my rounds. He is trying to change the properties of God in order to let the free will works. But, after all, the being is no longer God. He has not met with his burden of proof to show that God really has free will to do something which I specifically ask. I thank the readers and voters who really read this debate. Please vote as fairly as possible. Good Evening and have a nice year."	CON	28
S6acab37e-A9daf45ec	Free will is an illusion	"Perhaps every emotion you have ever had, could conceivably have been placed their by you. Induced by a past emotion because of what's happening to you right now. What's happening now, reminds you of a past situation, and the emotions that were tied to that situation. Whether you remember the situation or not, the emotional imprint remains with you, and can greatly effect how you act now. What memories are affecting your emotions at this very moment? Why did you remember the situations that are tied to your current emotions? If another random person were to go through the entire sequence of events that made up your entire life, in the exact same order, would they remember all the events that are influencing your mood right now? What have you forgotten, why did you forget it? What would the random person who is going through your sequence of events have forgotten by the time they reached this moment? Would they have the same exact emotions that you have right now? Would their emotions influence them to make the exact same decision that you will make? If you were severely assaulted by a large rock all up in your grill, it's going to make a large impact on your memory, but what about the neutral situations? My opponent agrees with me that ""what one might consider to be reasonable, others may not, the reasonable or logical decisions pertain only to ones self"". What situations you've decided to remember, and the ones you may have forgotten, or even the ones you've decided to not give a second thought and forget altogether, were the logical memories you've decided on that pertains to you. The emotions attached to your specific memory set, may influence your impulses, desires, anguish, or joy. My opponent has failed to convince me that the entire process that is influencing your mood right now, is or ever has been outside of your free will. Your free will appears in the memories you've decided store, which are influencing your mood right now! My opponent claims that ""you can never decide what you will decide what you will do"". Does anyone else find that statement to be superfluous or redundant? Of course you can't decide what you will decide, you would need to know the future! That, coupled with the fact that in the very sentence before, he/she claims ""you can sometimes DECIDE what you are going to do"". If you can decide what you are going to do, is that decision not free will? I think my opponent may have a misconception of time. NOW is the only time that exists! Now was the only time that has ever existed, and now is the only time that ever will exist. The past is an illusion caused by our memories. The future is just of an idea of what we think may happen next and of course it never does go the way we think. On a mathematical basis, time is the same phenomenon as distance, nothing more! Our sight must travel a distance to reach and perceive an object, or thing. That is what gives us the illusion that time is a rapidly changing sequence of events. My opponents claim that ""you can never decide what you will decide"" is based on an illusionary concept of time because you would need to know the future to do that, and the future isn't real! ""CHOICE!!!! The boy has no real choice, has he? Self interest, fear of physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of self abasment. Its insincerity was clear to be seen. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice"".-----So said the priest in one of my favorite novels/movies, a clockwork orange. Anthony Burgess was a firm believer of free will. Lets say, all sin were made illegal, would that make everyone saint? The point Anthony Burgess was trying to make was, if society is forced to abide by moral standards, does that actually make it a moral society? For a criminal to truly pay back there debt to society, first they must agree to abide by moral standards by CHOICE, not out of fear of punishment, and we can not force that choice on them. Clockwork Orange was a loud statement of free will. I most certainly stand by my claim that Anthony Burgess is not the best person to quote, to make an argument against free will!!!! My opponents argument is based on NOTHING!!!!!!! Neil DeGrasse Tyson and many others believe that early man(circa 50,000 years ago), probably thought the sky was made up of messages sent by thier gods! And how can we blame them, what tools could they have used to know otherwise? And what was beyond the stars, beyond the ever turning message board?..................Nothing! Until of course, we created telescopes to see that those messages were actually other planets, places we could conceivably visit. Then of course, we discovered the solar system, then the galaxy, then the universe, then yadda yadda, and what lies out beyond our universe?..................Nothing! In other spectrums of math and science, there's alot of ""nothing"", they even gave it its own number. Eighty-five percent of the universe is nothing. Ninety five percent of physicists believe the big-bang is a proven ""theory"", which means everything was created out of, or from nothing. Perhaps my opponent is correct when he/she claims that our ""conscious self"" comes from nothing. All we ""are"" is a pack of neurons. Maybe, the place or thing that our decision making comes from is nothing, but does that constitute as a proof of his proposal? What is that nothing he/she speaks of? Is it not just the ""great unknown? Is it actually nothing, or is it just beyond the scope of our senses? Neil DeGrasse Tyson points out that, beyond the scope of what our senses can perceive, you always find nothing, until of course you create the tools to see closer, or deeper into that ""nothing"", only to find it was not even close to nothing. The pattern always remains the same, we will continually see further and deeper into the nothing. Who's to say that we can't conceivably create the tools to look into what my opponent calls ""nothing""? Perhaps our computational skill can create an extra sense for us to be able to perceive our existence in ways we never imagined. All the better to cast light into the nothingness. Personally, I don't consider ""nothing"" to be proof of anything, let alone proof that free will is an illusion, his claim that our free will comes from nothing, however right or wrong it may be, it does not constitute as a proof of his proposal. His argument is based on NOTHING!!!! I must also point out that my opponent was very ""willy-nilly"" on whether he/she was making the argument that free will is merely outside of our control, or whether our entire life is predetermined! There's an obviously vast difference between the two. Yes, if our will is predetermined, we don't have free will, but if our life is an ever moving process of random events that we or anything has no control of, it's NOT predetermined. He/she aimlessly argues for one, or the other, or both, or whatever target his/her ""shot in the dark"" argument can hit. Perhaps not making much of the argument up from random quotes by people who may or may not agree with his/her thesis, would have helped to clarify his/her argument! Thanks for reading!"	CON	29

Sda24f625-A16ce04c1	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	"Again, I would like to thank the Instigator for issuing the challenge of this debate. Actually, I feel I need to clarify my statements. I said that God knows what will happen in the future, without error. God knows what will happen and knows with accuracy, but it doesn't mean things must happen that way. In other words, just because God knows the future doesn't mean it's the only possible outcome. It will happen that way, but it doesn't mean that it must. It could have happened another way, but if it did then God would know. I hope this makes it more clear. There are punishments for sins, and there are rewards for doing good. If we sin and die in our sins, we will go to Hell for eternity. Every person is on this path. It is not God's will that any should perish but that all should come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). However, God does not force anyone to love Him or to repent. If He did, then He would be choosing whom to save and whom to let suffer eternally in Hell. God knows who will believe in Him and who won't, but He doesn't force anyone to choose salvation. The choice is ultimately ours to make. So no, while every choice comes with a reward or punishment, not every choice comes with the same outcome. There is still nothing conflicting in my statements. Humans are inherently moral and rational creatures, but not every accepts the same standard of morality. While my parents taught me to respect the Bible and God's morality, an atheist will teach their kids not to believe in a god because to them, it is foolish. We may have certain morals in common (for instance, a Christian an atheist will both believe that murder is wrong), but a Christian will believe that fornication is wrong whereas an atheist will see nothing wrong with it. We all have the ability to reason (to decide for ourselves that path our lives should take), and we all have an inherent moral code (commonly referred to as a ""conscience""). You can inherit morality from places other than your parents. For instance, an atheist who comes to faith in Christ will draw their morality from the Scriptures. Also, if no parents are around, there is always the legal guardian, other family members, or friends. Everyone gets their morality from somewhere, and even if they don't have a good example of morality in their lives, everyone still has the inherent ability to know whether something is right or not. You are seeing conflicts in my statements where there are none. Free choice has nothing to do with morality. Even someone with no moral compass at all still has the freedom to choose their actions. But morality can affect how you choose. For instance, a happily married man who doesn't believe adultery is wrong may go out and sleep with another woman. Or he may still choose to be faithful to his wife because he has no desire to sleep with other women. Whereas a Christian should never decide to sleep with another woman because adultery is a sin, but there are still Christians who do it. Morality affects your decisions to act on your free will, but it has no bearing on free will in and of itself. Morality is not required to make a free choice. I agree that there is huge injustice in this world. But that doesn't negate free will. Good things happen to bad people, and bad things happen to good people. It's just a part of life. A very unfortunate part of life. This still doesn't negate free will. One can have the will to do something, even if their means prevent it. I am saying that there may be times in which our freedom to choose is taken away from us, but this doesn't mean the freedom to choose does not exist. We don't have to be completely free in every choice we make in order for free will to exist. Sometimes our means prevent us from doing or having what we want to have, and sometimes we are forced or coerced into making a choice we would not have made otherwise. But this doesn't mean that we are never free to choose anything. As this is our final round, I have responded to my opponent's objections and didn't add any new arguments to the mix. I believe I have shown that we do indeed have free will, even with the Christian God in the equation. There may be times when we can't choose because our means prevent it, or that we are forced or coerced into making a choice we would not have made otherwise, but the person taking our choice away had the choice of whether to take our choice away or not. If we find ourselves in a situation in which we really have no choice, this does not mean that we are never free to choose. Again, I thank the Instigator for issuing this challenge and the reader for your consideration in this matter."	PRO	31
S9f9b50af-A69d39ef8	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"Thanks ASB. ==Rebuttal== My opponent essentially has the same response to everything in my first round: that human's will not be the ones in control, something else will be. I usually wouldn't bring other debates into this one, but had I not read my opponent's debate with askbob I would be utterly confused by what he meant. Humans will not be controlling other humans? Who then? Machines? In my opponent's other debate, he argued that God would be in control and make all our decisions for us. I have two major responses: 1) God does not exist 2) Even if he does, he is most definitely not benevolent. *God does not exist* The only God that can be in total control of us would need to be omniscient (all knowing) and omnipotent (all powerful). Proof 1: According to Richard Dawkins, ""Incidentally, it has not escaped the notice of logicians that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually incompatible. If God is omniscient, he must already know how he is going to intervene to change the course of history using his omnipotence. But that means he can't change his mind about his intervention, which means he is not omnipotent."" [1] Proof 2: If God is omnipotent, he should be able to create a box, the contents of which are impossible to know. However, for God to be omniscient, he must know the contents of the box. My opponent also has the burden of proof. Since one cannot ""prove"" God's existence, my opponent cannot satisfy the BOP by proving that humans would not be the ones controlling other humans under ""total control."" *God is not benevolent* Since the only God that meets the above requirement (omniscience and omnipotence) is the Judeo-Christian God, I proceed to show that ""He"" is not benevolent, and thus will lead us to do immoral and horrible acts. Here are some of God's instructions on good moral principles and norms of behavior: Deut 25:11-12 ""If men get into a fight with one another, and the wife of one intervenes to rescue her husband from the grip of his opponent by reaching out and seizing his genitals, you shall cut off her hand; show no pity."" Deut 21:18-21 ""If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place . . . Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death."" On homosexuality: Lev 20:13 ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death."" On how to treat the rival tribes in Israel: Isaiah 13.13-22 ""Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered, and their wives ravished."" God on slave ownership: Ex 21:20-21 ""When a slave-owner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished. But if the slave survives for a day or two, there is no punishment; for the slave is the owner's property."" Col 3:22-24 ""Slaves, obey your earthly masters"" On discovering your new bride to not be a virgin: Deut 22:13-21 ""If, however, this charge is true, that evidence of the young woman's virginity was not found, then they shall bring the young woman out to the entrance of her father's house and the men of her town shall stone her to death"" On controlling your emotions: ""For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God"" Lastly, this is the same supposed God who does not intervene to stop countless natural disasters. This emotionally unstable God must enjoy watching us suffer. If ""He"" was in charge, it is unclear that he wouldn't simply force us to kill each other for ""His"" amusement. *Personal Ethics* Why would God make us follow a personal ethics system that humans designed - why not his own ""superior"" version of ethics, which is outlined above? How do we know that the person in ""total control"" will make us follow these specific ethical principles? R1) Anarchy *I said that in a world of free will, anarchy is disorder. My definition of disorder is crime.* This is why I concluded my opponent's definition is biased. He essentially defines anarchy as ""crime."" Murray N Rothbard and many others believed that anarchy (""a Stateless society"") was possible without the world devolving into disorder. The fact that people across the world are increasingly ordering themselves based on the location of markets and not the location of governments proves that governments are increasingly irrelevant. In addition, my opponent doesn't answer my reference to social contract theory. We can voluntarily submit our free will to another without having actually sacrificed that will; thus if someone really wanted to submit to total control (or anything in between total control and anarchy), that person could voluntarily submit some of their decision-making authority to a ""higher power"" (whether that be a divine being or a government). However, the choice to submit must remain our own. *We would only be controlled to follow these Principles. (Under the principles says nothing about eating different types of steaks.)* Remember I defined ""total control"" as the absence of free will. My opponent can't say that we'll still have free will UNLESS we want to do something ""bad."" That's not TOTAL control; that's PARTIAL control. Princeton's Wordnet defines ""total"" as ""complete in extent or degree and in every particular."" *Car analogy, repeated* I agree that free will can result in someone being harmed. So can total control. Also, the benefits of free will outweigh the detriments. *humans cannot drive themselves in compliance to the principles* Of course they can. While a few humans deviate from established morality, the vast majority refrain from killing or stealing from each other, meaning they are obeying the nonaggression axiom. The Yale Infant Cognition Center found that morality is innate, and by studying serial killers, psychologists have found that their neurology differs in serious ways from the average person, meaning people who deviate from morality often do so because of neurological problems. Somalia Although Somalia was not under ""total control"" prior to 1991, it was under a dictatorship, which is the closest evidence we can examine in today's debate of total control. My evidence clearly showed that Somalia is wealthier and SAFER under anarchy than under totalitarian control. *My opponent is stating that understanding right is better than doing the right thing.* No, what I said was that we get no credit for acting morally, unless we both understand and do the right thing. As Derrida points out, if we are forced to make a moral decision and avoid the difficult decision-making process itself, then the outcome has absolutely no meaning. If we choose to act morally, we are to be lauded; if we are forced to act morally, the person controlling us is to be lauded, but we have done nothing of value. We would just be mindless drones. True Marxist Communism I truly doubt that Carl Marx envisioned a world where God controlled our every action and desire to force us to be Communist. How is that not WORSE than Stalin's version of communism? At least under Stalin, there was a chance that people could escape the USSR or that Stalin would die and his reign would end. With God, there is no escape or end in sight. We can never again have an original thought or desire, or if we do, we at least will not be able to act on them. *If one desired steak, he would eat steak as long as it fell into compliance with the other rules.* If God relinquished control in situations that ""don't matter"" (according to my opponent), then again, that is partial control, not total control. We would still have free will, except in specific instances. Existentialism My opponent doesn't answer the fact that life is meaningless if we are all mindless drones. [1] The God Delusion, p."

S4a977824-A504ea7f7	If God is the omnipotent and omniscient creator of the world, then complete free will is impossible	"Thanks to my opponent for the organization. My rebuttal: 11) If a human builds a toaster, that is one thing. If God builds a toaster, he also built its surroundings. The air, the counter top or table, the tiny hairs that land on it: all of them are his craft (repeating my earlier emphasis that God created all). The air pressure that moves the dust was also set in specific motion by him. He knows exactly how each factor will affect the toaster. Past, present and future are all apart of his omniscience. It doesn't matter if he is actively affecting the situation: he set each atom into existence at creation. He knew how each placement of each atom would affect everything. He is also constantly aware of the state of the toaster as it deteriorates. 22) My opponent made an impressive point here. I will also use Christianity as a specific example. Paul, as a Christian, states in Ephesians 1:4 that God ""chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight."" Humans chose God because God willed them to. As for the antagonists, the Creator has power over them. Two omnipotent beings cannot coexist in conflict. If one cannot defeat the other he is not omnipotent. As evidenced in the book of Job from the Tanakh/Old testament Satan must ask God before he tempts. God reigns supreme. 33) Humans do make choices. The word describes our courses of action whether or not the decision begins and ends with us. The ladybug analogy would lead me to the same logic as the toaster analogy. 44) I make a fourth point to further the argument. If God wills that humans make choices of complete free will beyond his control, then these choices must not have been laid down before creation. These choices must be made within the bounds of time inside of humans. If they are outside of God's reach but within his creation he is then not omnipotent. My opponent did not accept my implication in the topic that God has complete free will. As he stated, I am arguing that God is the only possessor of complete free will. Thanks for a quality rebuttal. Enjoy the debate. -johannes jones"	PRO	33
Sda24f625-A48ad1dfc	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	"ï¿½I would like to sincerely thank this great debater for taking the time to continue to in this fascinating subject.ï¿½ I apologize for the lack of characters in our last debate I wildly underestimated the magnitude of this subject. My example came across vague, and maybe even hard to relate to. I guess we will start with, My fourth contention on our last debate, i was proposing my perspective of your model, ""anything that takes 1 of 2 possible paths have choice (so a dog is free if he chews my shoes over sandals)"" This is trying to aim at the question, Do dogs have free will You responded 4) Your dog does have a choice of what to chew up, even though you may chastise them and put them outside if the border does not compare to the bible taken literally, what is the essential properties needed to be considered a chooser I proposed that you were basing the destination on ""anything that takes 1 of 2 possible paths, so far this is your interpretation of free will, until otherwise stated Another possible answer is anything organized into a structure is considered to be alive, because it can exist in the universe that is constantly fluctuating. energy is existing for extremely small spans of time and then get annihilated, this is actually the one area pointed out by theist to describe randomness in the brain. They either accidentally or intentionally leave out that this is happening everywhere, to us animals plants rocks, and even time is in constant flux. All things that are considered solid are mostly empty space everything is in constant flux. Randomness is unable to predict, ï¿½but we can still compose a view of this based on general relativity, Einstein has stated that everything is relative, and noticed our universal speed limit, a term that will exist for as long as this universe.ï¿½ It has now been proven that time is even relative. Check out how the twins paradox relates to how they must constantly reset our GPS satellites to account for the difference in the gravitational force, if not constantly accounting for randomness bye bye Tom Tom. Interesting read at source http://metaresearch.org... Such comments referring to instability, such as, because atomic clocks change frequencies by small, semi-random amounts (of order 1 ns/day) at unpredictable times for reasons that are not fully understood. As a consequence, the long-term accuracy of these clocks is poorer than their short-term accuracy. ï¿½This model of the world has got to intrigue you first off, religion was invented when the world was flat, and spitting on wounds were a cure. They decided to make the line of what is conscious, making free will exclusive to humans. Everything has been considered conscious because nobody can place that dividing line. Here are some of my views on choice and how confusing the paradox can become if thinking that free will can be ""created""ï¿½ Considering that choice must ""be"", whether, or not it is ""chosen"" by god or not, because choice Demands the platform of choice, it in its nature, creates itself before it can be created, say that someone has no choice but to choose, because if they can propose to create choice or not it must already exist.ï¿½ Free Will is Choice, But the idea choice is a lot like the idea of god because, such as, How it would take a super intelligence to make intelligence , but Gods mind must be even more elaborate more complex, if a humans are complex enough to be considered unable to occur by random events then surely gods designer must be even more fundamentally unlikely to have occurred, because gods god would then be even more elaborate a structure, Much like when analyzing the concept of choice, One must presuppose choice exists before one can CHOOSE, to make Choice or not With throwing choice out of the equation and understanding that even god is subject to debate when he is considered free when there is no logical way choice can be chosenï¿½ It doesn't matter if one avenue split into two, and it doesn't matter if the ï¿½first choice to choose choice(choice to be)was chosen by god, or us, because choice is it's own prerequisite so such paradox must be just boiled down to whatever is, is because if its isn't it isn't. You have no choice but to go with the whatever is because is, is all there is or else it would be, otherwise. So back to the debate In the example my opponent stated ï¿½""god knows that you will change your mind"" ï¿½means that there is 0 chance that an atheist can be anything other than an atheist, where the baby vs MCATs is actually a possibility, maybe the same or more probable than the odds of the baby even being born in the first place. Question. Babies dies shorty after being born, If it is to preserve the babies fragile state to inhibit it from going to hell then all souls can be preserved in this way. If true thatï¿½means if an atheist were just murdered at birth it would save such a soul from an eternity of torment, sounds like killing every baby that could ever exist would be doing more good than what any church could do if just one atheist dies because of this not making use of loopholeï¿½a sad not to mention EXTREMELY Dangerous world view, and this is from an unlikely source being pro life an allï¿½ I await your response If you are unable see your will done without restriction then we are not taking free literally. My opponent has said that ""you are expected to live within your means"" in the case someone wills chicken but cannot always get what one wills. What would you do if you had a million dollars? Well you would act like a millionaire, which may include feeling like god thinks your so special that you deserve to know he is there by some timely saving grace, as most Christians attribute their faith to. Question. Is this ""living within means"" related to the Body, Brain capacity, Physical ability? Because I can agree with that completely! everyone lives within their means of decision making innate to themselves, this exchange is not just monetary, it could even be considered that the body is an economy of chemicals and one can only live within the means of the chemicals available, since every piece of energy must hold within the means of E=MC2 this means of reference is as expected just another way of expressing the fundamental aspects that exist in numerous applications. This equilibrium does not signify free will. It is the only way in which the universe is holding itself together. I think that is enough for now I am curious as to what the finding may be."	CON	34

S9f9b50af-A938f5368	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"Here we go... this debate is under society. Opening: In this debate, I establish that the definition of complete control is a world that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong and are controlled to do the right thing. Principles of Personal Ethics include: Concern for the well-being of others Respect for the autonomy of others Trustworthiness & honesty Willing compliance with the law (with the exception of civil disobedience) Basic justice; being fair Refusing to take unfair advantage Benevolence: doing good Preventing harm http://www.ethics.ubc.ca... This is my establishment of right. We would only be controlled to follow these Principles. I know that my second rule says respect for the autonomy of others, but this rule is with compliance of all the other principles. Since 1997, the following framework of principles has been used by six instructors to facilitate learning and spark dialogue with a wide variety of students, business people and professionals in Africa, China, Czechoslovakia and across North America. In each case, participants were encouraged to suggest changes, additions or deletions. Only one minor change has ever been suggested. 1). Bastardizing Free Will: Anarchy The definition of anarchy is without rule.- Encarta Dictionary The antonym of anarchy is without order.- Encarta Dictionary Order: 4. absence of crime, a peaceful condition in which laws are obeyed and misbehavior or crime is not present or is prevented. Encarta Dictionary These definitions of anarchy are from a world that is run off free will. As I established in the beginning, the definition of the perfect world is one that is run off of those universal principles that were mentioned. In a world of free will, without someone steering the wheel of the car, the car is not in control. Free will for one person can prove to be detrimental to someone else. ""It is all fun and games until someone gets hurt."" Total control under the universal principles mentioned would drive the car and the car would be humans. With free will, anarchy is not logically possible. 2). Bastardizing Free Will: Exercising Free Will Should life be such an ultimate test to do what is right instead of wrong? It is hard to simply comprehend the choices between right and wrong. For both are merely ambiguous to the average human. Universal right and wrong is determined by principles. Hurting people while exercising one’s free will should never be justified as right. 3). There is good in everyone: The truth is that there is good in everyone. It is hard to do the right thing all of the time… Not be selfish, not to lie, not to steal, or kill, what if a force drove us to do the right thing all of the time. This will happen; the average person does not need to know the absolute difference between right and wrong when a force would drive us. Man, without this force driving us feels like we need to know the difference between right and wrong. 4). Marxist Communism under the universal principles listed: Communism is a sociopolitical movement that aims for a classless and stateless society structured upon common ownership of the means of production, free access to articles of consumption, the end of wage labour and private property in the means of production and real estate. In Marxist theory, communism is a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the productive forces that leads to a superabundance of material wealth, allowing for distribution based on need and social relations based on freely-associated individuals. http://en.wikipedia.org... With humans living according to the principles, this society would work. The ideal world where one does not worry about money, the World has plenty to share, with total control according to the principles mentioned, this is possible. With controlled will according to the principles listed, anarchy is logically possible. Marxist communism is anarchy. 5). Marxist Communism is not a model of modern China and Soviet Russia communism: China and Soviet Russia’s communist models are not based on Marxist Communism.

S9f9b50af-A52601ba8	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	Thanks ASB. “I’m not advocating free will. If one wanted steak and it was with compliance to the rules then he would be forced to eat steak.” This still sounds like free will with a slight caveat. Also, who decides what is or is not in compliance with “the rules?” Does eating a steak show “concern for the well-being of others?” If we didn’t use so many crops to feed the cattle, there would be far more food in the world. It’s unclear how the “controller” will evaluate competing rights claims. “So I guess it is safe to say that a cure for AIDS, since it is the not probable, will be worse than a cure for AIDS. Is it really that safe to assume that all things that are improbable are better than the known because Bluesteel said so?” I’m not saying that total control is improbable, but that it is impossible. My opponent drops my proof that God does not exist, so he agrees that total control is impossible. Things that exist are better than things that do not exist. I’d rather have a real Ferrari than an imaginary Ferrari. A cure for AIDS is also not improbable. “A Cure For HIV/AIDS: On The Horizon” http://commonhealth.wbur.org... “When was the last time someone killed another person… today.” This doesn’t answer that the vast majority of people act morally. Of course there will be some deviants, but the majority of people don’t murder. The need to control the murderers does not justify eliminating free will. “Rothbard was a moron: Anyone who believes in jumping from capitalism to anarchy or true communism ‘successfully’ is a moron.” Rothbard believed in anarcho-capitalism, not anarcho-communism. I still ask my opponent to find an anarcho-communist author who is in favor of eliminating free will to achieve their utopia. My opponent never answers my argument that total control is just totalitarian control to the extreme. My opponent also never answers who is in control. Someone has to evaluate competing rights claims. Imagine that a train is traveling down the train tracks at 200 miles per hour and the track splits into two. On the track the train is currently on are three people who are stuck on the track; you can pull a lever to divert the train to the other track, but there is a single person stuck on that track. Do you intervene to save 3 lives at the expense of one person’s life? This is what Derrida calls the aporia of the undecidable, where moral decision-making takes place. My opponent’s ethical system does not give us an answer as to what we should do (just that we respect human life), so forced will does not suffice to give us an answer. Only a person can decide what to do in this situation. In addition, who writes the rules? My opponent has picked rules that were created by free will. This seems incompatible with his case. Locke is still another straw man. My point with social contracts was that if someone (like my opponent) wants to submit to forced will, let him or her do so voluntarily. Let that person use his free will to submit himself to some higher power who will control him like a puppet. But people should still get to make the decision whether to submit to forced will. “Derrida lived in a world of free will, he sees things every day, like we do that just make him mad.” How does my opponent know this? Derrida clearly believed that free will was central to morality. “Derrida is also a nihilist” Not true and irrelevant. Let’s evaluate my opponent’s case by looking to the Matrix Trilogy. According to the Architect, the machines built a utopia, a perfect world with no suffering or sadness because people were not free to act on their desires. Yet the humans ultimately rejected this first matrix. The machines had to create a new matrix with a semblance of free will, but this brought back misery and suffering. And with free will came the ability for some humans to reject the Matrix completely and choose to live free, in the real world. While the second matrix and the real world may not be perfect, they are both superior to a world with no free will, where we are either mindless drones or trapped within our bodies, unable to act on our own desires.	CON	38
S9f9b50af-A753d7d3c	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"Thanks for challenging me ASB. Definitions My opponent has set up “total control” in opposition to free will, so I define “total control” as “the absence of free will.” Burden of proof My opponent has the burden to prove that a world where no free will exists is preferable to a world with free will. ==Rebuttal== Personal Ethics The fact that humans could put this list together themselves, using their free wills, proves that a world with free will is not a world devoid of ethics and justice. R1) Anarchy My opponent brings up a really biased definition of anarchy (anarchy = crime). The Oxford English Dictionary defines anarchy as “A social state in which there is no governing person or group of people, but each individual has absolute liberty (without the implication of disorder).” [1] First, I’d like to point out that a society can have a government AND still have free will. People can voluntarily enter a social contract and cede some of their decision-making authority to a State in exchange for protection. Democracies hardly meet my opponent’s conception of “total control.” Even totalitarian regimes don’t have a complete absence of free will, although they are closer to “total control” than democracies. Since most people would agree that democracies, like the United States, are superior to totalitarian regimes, like North Korea, then less control must be good. Murray N. Rothbard, in For A New Liberty, describes his belief in the non-aggression axiom: that all aggression against person’s or their property is illegitimate. Under Rothbard’s conception of anarchy, not only is individual aggression seen as illegitimate, but government aggression is illegitimate as well. Let us contrast this conception of anarchy with an imagined Statist society that had “total control” over its citizenry, meaning the country’s ruler could bend all his subject’s wills to his own, operating them like robots. This society will be far inferior to anarchy because the ruler will use his power to steal from his citizens to enrich himself and will use his automaton citizens to start wars with other governments to maximize his share of world power; this is empirically proven by the actions of all Statist governments. Somalia, for example, has faired FAR better under anarchy than under the military dictatorship of Mohamed Siad Barre, which collapsed in 1991. According to Peter Leeson, economist at West Virginia University, “Indicators of Somali welfare remain low in absolute terms, but compared to their status under government show a marked advance. Under statelessness life expectancy in Somalia has grown, access to health facilities has increased, infant mortality has dropped, civil liberties have expanded, and extreme poverty (less than $1 PPP/day) has plummeted. In many parts of the country even security has improved. In these areas citizens are safer than they’ve been in three decades (UNDP 2001). Somalia is far from prosperous, but it has made considerable strides since its government collapsed 15 years ago.” [2] Clearly, freedom is superior to more control, which leads to corruption. When you consider control, remember the immortal words of Lord Acton: “All power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Car analogy Nonsensical – if we are the car, we obviously have the capability to “drive ourselves.” Free will for one person can prove to be detrimental to someone else. True, and total control can be detrimental to everyone. 2) Bastardizing Free Will Having a conception of ethics, like the nonaggression principle, solves my opponent’s objection. People can have free will and yet live by certain norms of behavior. In fact, studies at the Infant Cognition Center at Yale show that even babies know right from wrong, meaning acting morally, such as respecting someone’s right to life, is an innate attribute. [3] 3) There is good in everyone Then why can’t we trust that good and allow people to make their own decisions? 4) Communism is good This has nothing to do with free will. Also, no it’s not. Communist regimes have willfully murdered approximately 260 million of their own citizens over the course of human history. [4] Most of these murders were carried out to silence political dissidents. Communist regimes have sacrificed countless others for the greater good. Stalinist Russia sacrificed 7 million lives to starvation due to farm collectivization. [5] Mao Zedong forced his people to make steel in their backyards instead of farming, leading to the deaths of 45 million people in 4 years. [6] China’s incredible growth based on free market reforms proves that free market capitalism is superior to communism (a “controlled” economy). Just compare Cuba (communist) to Chile. According to the Chicago Tribune, in Cuba, ""food shortages are frequent, the stock of adequate housing has shrunk, and hospital patients often have to bring their own sheets, food and even medical supplies."" [7] The same source says that Chile has become 4 times wealthier than Cuba since 1980 ""thanks to bold free-market reforms."" 5) Stalin is not Marxist communism I believe this is a point for my side – “true” communism would be communism without totalitarian control (“total control”). ==My case== C1) Free will = ability to choose “David Hume thought that free will . . . is simply the “power of acting or of not acting, according to the determination of the will: that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to move, we also may.… This hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to everyone who is not a prisoner and in chains.” This suggests that freedom is simply the ability to select a course of action, and an agent is free if he is not being prevented by some external obstacle from completing that course of action.” [8] Thus, imagine a world without free will. You want to eat a juicy steak, but instead someone hijacks your mind and forces you to eat a boring chicken breast. You want to sleep in, but someone takes over and forces you to wake up at 6 am. You want to go to the movies, but someone hijacks your mind and forces you to work for 12 hours on a Saturday. A world without choice is a very bland, boring world. C2) Existentialism Existentialists believe that choice imbues our lives with meaning and without the ability to make choices, life will be devoid of meaning. Living a “moral life” is meaningless if you are forced to do so. “According to Derrida, political and moral responsibility only exists where one has to go through the aporia of the undecidable . . . Otherwise there is no decision, only a mechanical application of rules.” We get no credit for “acting morally” if we are forced to do so. In addition, if we are simply robots playing out the desires of some other being, our lives are meaningless. Only by having desires and the ability to act on those desires do we create meaning in our lives. Without choice, we are merely automatons. C3) Who will be in control? How can we ensure that a benign dictator will be in “total control” of us? If the dictator is not benign and is instead malevolent, the world will be a much worse place under “total control.” Imagine Adolph Hitler being in total control of our bodies and minds. That would not be a better world. [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com... [5] http://tinyurl.com... [6] http://tinyurl.com...

S15efddff-A9450e948	God has free will.	"Pro is debating a Truism Truism: http://uofadebate.files.wordpress.com... Now look at my case. We shall ignore his case. 1. We are arguing that this debate to show that God has free will while being Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnibenevolent. My opponent is trying to change God""s properties; therefore he is no longer God and does not have free will. When he is not God, then he has free will. This is what my opponent trying to say. Which means when he is God he has no free will. When the entity has three aspects then he is God. When he is without those, then he is no longer God. Like a car without tyres. Would you still consider that as a car? It is quite funny. 2. If we say that God has existed which means Evil has also existed. Since my opponent is using the Holy Bible then fine. Maybe I am too rushed and mistake human first then water. Sorry for the confusion. 3. The definition of free will implies ability. Everything stands in contradiction exists. Proton exists, so does electron. Since my opponent admits that God is having positive property without many objections. Then, what is the being with negative property? That is EVIL. Truth exists, so does lie. Up exists, so does down. Throughout this we can or we must admit that there is an opposite being or thing. If I am suffering now, why doesn""t god save me? Is he malevolent? No, he existed. Does he have free will? He is so powerful. So, what is preventing god from saving me? That would be evil. As my opponent admits, God is having positive property and Evil is having negative. What is the reason God does not destroy Evil? Evil is as powerful as god? Evil is more powerful than God? God is more powerful than Evil? If evil is as powerful as God, since God is Omnipotent then its power is infinity. Infinity (God) - Infinity (Evil) =0 Which means if God applies all its power then while evil is also doing the same. Then, nothing happens because they cancel out each other evenly. God applies infinity force to move this object to right and then Evil applies infinity force to move this object to left. Then it does not move. That said, God has no ability to do what it wants. Therefore no free will. Ability : possession of the means or skill to do something https://www.google.com... 4. Did God create free will? How then does it itself have free will? If God created free will then God had no choice in doing so. It must have been predestined to create it. But what created that predestination? God couldn't have created free will; and as God is the ultimate creator, if it didn't create free will then it means that free will doesn't exist, for itself or anything else. 5. God is moral. Which means he cannot do something bad. Let this be the case. I am going to die. 1. God let me die. (This won""t happen because he is morally good) 2. God saves me. (This might happen) We see that the choice of god is fixed because he can only have one option not the other. Did god choose to do that hence no free will for God"" Now comes to number two? If evil is trying to drag me to hell and God is trying to save me. Then nothing happens. Note God is powerful and has the ability to save human. God cannot have the ability why so? First I am not saved. Second the existence of evil cancels out God""s Force. In other words, God has no ability because nothing happens. 6. If God is all knowing then he knows what he is going to in the incoming time. This means this has violated free will. Yes God exists, but he does not have free will. I am going to let Jesus exists in the future. It happens. 7. When people say that God has free will, they must also mean that God is imperfect. If God is not perfect then it becomes possible for God to choose a less-than-perfect action. If God is not imperfect, then, it is impossible for god to perform imperfect actions. Therefore God has no free will."	CON	40
Sda24f625-A4140ea8	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	"I would like to thank my fellow debater for continuing through, this discussion has been a great experience for me, I am a novice when it comes to structure. I greatly appreciate you having this back and forth with me, and I sincerely apologize for taking up so much of your time last round. A few questions, and assumptions based on your comments. ""God may know the future, and may be able to know with accuracy what will happen but it doesn't mean things must happen that way"" one may assume you should have stated COMPLETE ACCURACY Based on your making mention of what follows ""The difference would be that God would know if your plans are going to change, or if you just decide not to go and put it off until tomorrow. You are still free to make those choices, God just knows which choice you are going to make and whether you'll change them or not."" but (There are also instances in the Scriptures where God had planned to do something, but relented and didn't follow through. For instance, ""after Jonah witnessed to the Ninevites, God did not follow through on their destruction due to the fact that they repented of their wickedness (Jonah 3). God, of course, knew that the Ninevites would repent when Jonah went and revealed their sinfulness to them, but had they not repented they would have been destroyed."") in this example; god is seemingly always relenting from enforcing punishments IN EVERY INSTANCE that a fork in the road may lead to a destructive or constructive path, in your view god is relenting punishment for all of us, all the time. In other words It would be meaningless to say, God is not following through on my destruction due the fact I didn't do anything worthy of destruction, god knew that I wouldn't but if I did I would have been destroyed. Do you see how strange it sounds that god didn't follow through because he realized what he already knew. On to the next thing Seemingly conflicting statements ""Humans are inherently moral, and rational creatures, with the ability to reason and understand the world around us."" ""Children must be taught to understand morality"" There seems to be a lot of leniency given to babies, and not enough to us all. It would be hard to uphold a public office with such a quote, but, it should be viewed for what it is. There are many variables in this universe in which you will find yourself without choices. That is almost the fun, what choices your current situation will allow you. I say almost the fun, because sometimes, it can be not very fun at all, but survival. There are humans that live in cannibalistic tribes, and some have been known to describe gravity, as coming up to meet the object. The point is, it becomes painfully obvious that morality is subject to individuality, and individuality is learned through whatever means of society is available. Much like every other species. Your Bank Robber Scenario ""If a bank robber holds a gun to a bank teller's head and tells her to put the money in the bag, she still has a free choice. She can disobey and take a bullet to the head, or comply and give the robber his money. No jury would convict that bank teller because she acquiesced under duress. If she hadn't complied, she would have been killed. However, even though some choices have negative consequences, there is no negative consequence just by virtue of being able to choose. In fact, the basic ability to choose helps us to grow and mature."" It seems like in every example you allow a fair amount of choice, you most likely allow this to also blame for the real problem, Causation. If we could now allow my scenario for lack of choice. A hardworking Christian mother of three comes in to work after doing early prep for the Food Drive for the Homeless Charity which she will holding after another day of good Ole bank telling. Just after greeting sally she is approaching her teller station, when a sneaky middle eastern man shoots her in the back of the head. Question. What happened to our female bank tellers Free Choice there? What if it wasn't another person sinning but an earthquake destroyed the bank, killing an innocent. More on the Chicken Allergy ""In your last round of the previous debate, you mentioned someone with a chicken allergy. Someone with that allergy can still choose to eat chicken if they wish, but they must be prepared to deal with the consequences. A teenager who has a habit of breaking out after eating chocolate is still free to do so. Some teenagers are willing to risk a pimple to consume chocolate. We all have choices, and some consequences are more dangerous and long-lasting than others. That doesn't mean we are not free to choose."" The issue is some teenagers can eat chocolate and not break out, some can eat chicken and not be allergic. God is all powerful and just chooses to make some people break out more often or for different reasons than others. How are we free to choose if we have no idea of the consequences and we just have to go with the limited choice that's there, and hope it doesn't kill us. People have serious medical problems all the time, and they did nothing to deserve it, and there is nothing to be learned, babies born so sick they just die. Without the burden of proof I am sure we can both agree on the fact, neurological problems are not chosen, but either hereditary, or some other cause ubiquitous to most living species on earth, such as lack of oxygen. Poor judgement is a onset symptom with a lack of oxygen, and many ways just that cause, can be caused. also say one little boy goes for the cookie jar, and seeing this, the other boy does the same, but in doing so he receives a hefty wop on the hand. I am being light example on this but then again you might say its not right to wop kids on the hand so its irrelevant, or you might say that boy deserved it because he knew or should have known the consequences. One Last Thing Just trying to understand this basic story from the info provided. ""When God created Adam and Eve, he planted a tree in the Garden of Eden called the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which He forbade them to eat from. He knew they would eat from it anyway, but He didn't force them do it. They had the free will not to eat from the tree, and didn't have to do it. God knew they would anyway. (Genesis 2-3)."" ""I fail to see how it is possible for a baby to pass the MCAT test, or any other test. You have to learn about the discipline before you can hope to pass a fundamental test in that discipline."" I don't think Adam and Eve learned about the discipline of resistance, but not a fundamental test, a full on, getting serious test. It seems like if you are going to gamble punishment for the entire species then maybe it would have been a good idea for god to take your test taking advice. Also whether this should play into the model of discussion, over debate, I greatly appreciate and enjoy it all the same. I look forward to our next round!"	CON	41
S9f9b50af-Abfb5c834	Total Control (pro) is Better Than Free Will (con)	"Thanks for the debate ASB. ==Competing Rights Claims== Morality is not as simple as my opponent would like to make it out to be. In the train example, there are three people on one track and one person on the other. One group is going to be hit by the train and die, which do you save? My opponent claims that under forced will, you would always be forced save the three people, even if the one person were your father. Firstly, I don't see how he reaches this conclusion based on his limited ethical framework. Secondly, what if the one person was the President of the United States and the three people were Osama bin Laden, a re-incarnated Adolph Hitler, and Glenn Beck? What if the one person was the second coming of Christ? What if the one person was a small child and the three people were all 90 years old? It's not clear that you should ALWAYS choose to save the three people, regardless of circumstances. Free will leads us to morality, when we have to confront the aporia of the undecidable and make a difficult decision. The fact that my opponent has to refer to an ethical framework that was created by free will proves the downfall of his ethical system. If an ethical dilemma arises that forced will cannot solve, we will need to resort to free will to solve it. ==Free will with a slight Caveat== My opponent never clearly answered: can we eat the steak under forced will or not? There are some people who claim that eating steak does not respect others or the environment because if we were all vegetarians, there would be plenty of food. So can we eat steak under forced will or will we all be forced to be vegetarians? ==Things that exist are better== My opponent's only real refutation is ""do you prefer a real or imaginary death."" This is a false dichotomy: you cannot choose an imaginary death because death IS real and immortality IS non-existent. The real dichotomy would be: do you prefer an existent life (with an inevitable death) or a non-existent life (where you can pretend you are immortal). My opponent says, ""It has been proven that people can move before thought comes in."" This is utterly false. If you move your arm, a brain scan will show activity in your motor cortex preceding the movement by fractions of a second. Free will obviously exists. If you have the ability to change your mind about something, you have free will. Obviously, free will, which actually exists, is better than forced will, which cannot exist unless there was an omniscient and omnipotent God, but I disproved this possibility. == A vast majority may not kill== My opponent says that many people don't follow the law, yet he argues for anarcho-communism? This is confusing. People are not incapable of following morality, but they sometimes don't agree on one moral system. Many people would not consider cheating on a stupid school assignment ""immoral"" if doing the project is a waste of time and would jeopardize grades and learning in more important classes. Many people would not consider all lying to be immoral – if your daughter asks you ""daddy, don't I look pretty,"" and you don't think she does, I don't think it's the time to say, ""sorry hunny, but that dress is really ugly."" Most people consider white lies to be okay. Many people don't follow ""the law"" because they often don't agree with the laws, like the laws that banned sodomy or the laws against smoking marijuana. Now that my opponent has brought ""the law"" into forced will, I'm even more confused as to his advocacy. Who gets to set the rules that we are forced to follow? My opponent never answers this question adequately. He just repeats, ""man can set the rules."" Which man (or woman)? Whoever gets to write the rules that we are all forced to follow essentially has totalitarian control over the entire world. Also, most people respect the non-aggression axiom; they don't aggress against another's person or property. The reason is that most people agree that these actions are immoral. My opponent has no evidence that people are systematically incapable of following moral systems based on negative rights, and thus he never adequately proves that forced will is necessary and justifies sacrificing free will. ==Rothbard== Too bad the debate is over, but I challenge my opponent to give one example where the government has successfully intervened in the free market to prove his assertion that capitalism cannot exist without government. Somalia's huge increase in economic growth under anarchy disproves this assertion. ==Marx== His source says that Marx denied free will because he thought the Communist Revolution was ""inevitable."" My opponent's source isn't that credible. Marx believed that it was clear to anyone observing historical trends that workers would inevitably rise up and demand the fruits of their labor. That doesn't mean he denied that those workers had free will; he just believed that anyone with free will, who was denied the fruits of his labor for long enough, would eventually revolt. ==Social contract== My point here was merely that if my opponent wants to give up his free will, that is his right, since he has free will. But we must start with free will before we are given the option of giving in to forced will. My opponent himself proves this because he concedes that moral principles wouldn't exist without free will. ==Derrida== Derrida is not a nihilist – no evidence of this is provided. And it's irrelevant to Derrida's viewpoint that morality doesn't exist without free will. If humans are forced to follow ""natural laws"" of behavior, then when we act morally, it is no more meaningful than when a rock falls when dropped, since it is merely following a natural law. ==The Matrix== This wasn't intended as evidence, but as an entertaining side-note. CONCLUSION My opponent fails his burden of proof because he never answers adequately who gets to write ""the rules"" or why the ethical principles he chose at random off the internet are the correct and only ethical principles we need to follow. My opponent fails to explain how competing rights claims can be adjudicated without free will. My opponent fails to prove that total control is even possible, since he refuses to argue in favor of God (since that didn't work out for him in his last debate). My opponent argues only for partial control, saying we can do anything we like (e.g. eat steak) as long as it doesn't violate an ethical principle – this sounds a lot like free will. We have thoughts and desires in our minds and then our bodies are forced to follow those thoughts and desires – this sounds more like a biological description of how our bodies actually function in real life, rather than an argument in favor of ""total control."" Assuming my opponent had actually argued for total control, you should vote Con in today's debate because a world without free will is a world devoid of meaning. We would all be mindless automatons; puppets controlled by some puppet master. Totalitarian systems of control were always driven on fear – fear of the enemy, fear of economic collapse, fear of powerful minorities. My opponent's system is no different – totalitarian control of the mind based on fear of other humans and what they might do using their free will. Don't give in to this irrational fear. Vote Con. Thank you for reading."	CON	42
S6acab37e-A2cde2ff5	Free will is an illusion	"I have to commend my opponent for quoting Anthony Burgess, (one of my faves) however I must point out that the quote was taken entirely out of context because it was more of a political message, and if you read between the lines of that particular quote you may come to the conclusion that it's a very libertarian point (clockwork orange had a libertarian message). Mr. Burgess was simply pointing out that governments like to make people feel like they have a say in how government is run and it is obvious that he doesn't believe people do have a real say, but that doesn't mean he felt that people couldn't or shouldn't have a say in governmental policy. It was more of an observation on how governments conduct themselves and less an argument against free will. Personally, if I were trying to make an argument against free will, Burgess would not make my shortlist of people to quote, but hey it's your argument and you have the free will to conduct it in your own manner!!!! (tee hee, tee hee) It seems to me that my opponents argument is basically stating that since we cannot control the circumstances that surround us, then we must not have free will. I still have yet to read anything that convinces me that the process of observation, computation, and then ultimately reaction, does not belong solely to the beholder. I don't yet see any metaphysical evidence that shows me how or why the process from observation to reaction is not under our control. I disagree with my opponent that we cannot dictate what impulses arise in our consciousness. Perhaps we might not seem to be able to control our impulses, but it is us who put the information (emotion) in our brain that made us act impulsive to begin with. Lets say the rock I spoke about did indeed hit the newborn, then the emotions attached to the horrible event are stored in the childs brain for the child to reference in the future, and anytime the child encounters an event that seems similar to the child, then the child is reminded of the emotion he/she felt during the first incident, but the childs emotions are not what causes the child to react. It would be the choice of the child to act or react, or not act at all. It is us who does the work of observing, processing and storing the emotional information that we use in our everyday lives, but our emotions do not and cannot control us. Emotions are a complex system of synapses at work in conjunction with fluids being sent throughout the body, it's nothing more than our sense of touch, but we tend to attach pleasant or unpleasant or neutral additudes on those emotions, but those emotions cannot control whether we want to run in terror, or just sit and do nothing. Higher self awareness is not just something you read about in those creepy church pamphlets about how the world is going to end tomorrow, it's a legitimate psychological theory, and it deals with the idea that just the fact that we realize our emotions do not control us, may help us to have a better understanding of ourselves as individuals. If you find the time to read up on it, give it a looksey, it's an interesting topic! http://psychology.iresearchnet.com... My opponent asks what I think it means to act reasonably. I guess I have to admit that I didn't have a particular definition in mind when I used the word. I guess I would reason that reason can only take place with time, the more time we have to make ""logical"" decisions based off of observation, the more ""reasonable"" a choice may seem to be. Of course what one might consider to be reasonable, others may not, the reasonable or logical decisions pertain only to ones self. My opponent asks why I like to act reasonably or not and why is reason valued. That's a tough one to answer because I don't value reason over impulse or vice versa. I have my own emotional reference table, based off of situations and observations unique to me so far as I can see, and it was I who did the work of enduring the circumstances that created those emotions and it was I who stored the information and I am the one who can use the information if I choose to do so. If I were to endure a situation unlike any I've ever had, it will be me who will choose to act reasonably or impulsively or irrationally or do nothing. Thank You, and have a FABULOUS day!!!"	CON	43
Sda24f625-A92814e6c	The existence of free will as proposed by the bible (Cont.debate)	"I would like to welcome Con back to the debate and am grateful he did not simply give it up. ""one may assume you should have stated COMPLETE ACCURACY' Yes, that should really go without saying as the word accuracy, itself, means without error. ""in this example; god is seemingly always relenting from enforcing punishments IN EVERY INSTANCE that a fork in the road may lead to a destructive or constructive path, in your view god is relenting punishment for all of us, all the time."" Not every time. After all, Sodom and Gomorrah did not repent of their wickedness and they were destroyed for it. God's mercy and grace is always available, but only if you receive it and change your wicked ways. As I have stated, God does not force anyone to do anything. If you haven't repented, He's not going to forgive you. If He knows it's going to happen, the effects don't happen until the cause happens. For instance, God knows how long we're going to live. He also knows if we're going to repent or not. Now say you get hit by a car and die early on in life. God would know if you would have repented had you been hit by the car, but since you got hit by the car before you repented you would not be saved. This is why Christians urge people not to wait because you don't know how long you have until you die. There is nothing conflicting in my statements. Humans have the inherent ability to reason within ourselves, but we still must be taught right from wrong. That's why we have parents. I fail to see how your examples of cannibalistic societies and those with a different understanding of gravity are relevant to the existence of free will. This isn't about morality, this is about free choice. No matter what your morality, you still have choices you can make. Even if you have differing opinions of what is good or not, you still have the same choice I do. If I believe A is right and you believe B is right, I might choose A and you might choose B because we both consider ourselves to be moral people. However, no one is perfect -- I might occasionally choose B and you might occasionally choose A because we don't particularly feel like abiding by our morals that day. I'm not sure what you mean by Causation. If something causes me to act a certain way, I could still act the opposite if I so chose. For instance, if someone is annoying me I could yell and them to be quiet, as anyone might be inclined to do in that situation. But I could also choose to ignore it, or even stand up and go someplace else. There may be certain situations in which we don't have a choice, but that's because someone takes our choice away from us. The man who shot her in the back of the head took away her choice to continue living. He did have the choice of whether to shoot her, to give her demands, or to not try and rob the bank. She was still a free person, just like the rest of us. Same with the earthquake. A natural disaster took her choice away. It wouldn't be accurate to say she never had free will just because her choice was taken away in one situation. You're misconstruing Christian theology. God doesn't make anyone break out with pimples or gives them food allergies. These things are a result of the fall, when Adam and Eve originally sinned. There may be situations in which we don't have a choice, but that doesn't take away from our free will. Sometimes there is no choice to make, or no good choice, but we are forced into the situation. Our choice in the matter is taken away from us. With the example about the cookie jar, you are actually helping to make my case. The boy had a choice of whether to go for the cookie or not. It is irrelevant if one boy was punished and the other not. They both made the decision to take a cookie against their parents' wishes. One was punished because he was caught doing it. ""I don't think Adam and Eve learned about the discipline of resistance, but not a fundamental test, a full on, getting serious test. It seems like if you are going to gamble punishment for the entire species then maybe it would have been a good idea for god to take your test taking advice.""

S15efddff-Abf09444f	God has free will.	Thank you for the interesting topic. I hope this will be a productive and civil exchange. During the course of this debate, I will attempt to prove that God (Who we are assuming exists for the sake of this debate.) does indeed have free will. Arguments According to your definitions of God and free will, it is already apparent that God has free will. Omnipotent - God is all powerful, sovereign. Free will: the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion. Being that you have not defined the word fate, I will take the liberty of doing so myself. I trust you will agree with the following definition. Fate- The development of events outside a person’s control, regarded as predetermined by a supernatural power. [1] Obviously, nothing is outside the control of God, being that he is Omnipotent. Also, it can not come from a supernatural power, being that God is the supernatural power. A being with unlimited power would, of course, be able to do anything that it wanted. Therefore, God has the power to act without the constraint, not only of necessity or fate, but of everything. Back to you Con. [1] http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...	PRO	45

Sf1aaf9c4-A183b6c3	Predestination (Pro/For) vs. Free Will (Con/Against)	"The debate here is a dangerous one, but I feel the need to address it in a culture where everyone accepts the free will aspect of Christianity. This is a minor doctrine, so it is not super important for a believer to believe this. I have been curious for quite some time to what Arminians use for their defense and I have seen many defenses but none have been based on ""Sola Scriptura"", which weakens their point. My goal is to show BIBLICAL evidence for predestination and to express my side in the best way possible. Your job, as the viewers, is to vote according to argument and not belief. See who displays their argument better than the other and do not be biased to your own side, unless you are convinced that the opposing view of yours did not lay out the fundamentals in a understandable way. Now... To start, we have to lay down a few questions in order to believe in predestination. 1. Does God love everyone? 2. Does God ever intervene in someone's will? 3. Is there proof of predestination in the Bible? 1. DOES GOD LOVE EVERYONE? This is the critical question to answer when discussing predestination, because if you believe that God loves everyone, then why on earth would he decide to harden people's hearts? Most Christians today believe that God indeed loves EVERYONE and cannot hate anyone. Logically, let us dig deeper into this. I want the viewers to ask themselves these three questions? Does God love sin? Does God love Satan? Does God love Servants of Satan? IF you answered no for the first two, you have to answer no for the final question. It would be impossible to explain logically how you could say no two the first two and yes to the last one. Before coming to Christ, we were all servants of Satan and lived according to our own desires. (Ephesians 2:1-3) ""And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, FOLLOWING the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience"" among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind."" To go along with this, let us turn to the Psalms. Psalms 6: ""There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers."" When we were ""dead in our trespasses"", wouldn't you say you did one of these things? And yet you think that God just loves people who aren't born again because of this idea we've been taught ever since the ""Second Great Awakening"". And yet again, we turn to Romans 9 and read this in verse 13: ""Just as it is written: 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."" So it is possible that God CAN hate someone on this earth. As crazy as it sounds, it is true. So by using this information, we can dig deeper into predestination. 2. DOES GOD EVER INTERVENE IN SOMEONE'S WILL? Remember the term ""FREE WILL"". Let us define it here and now. According to a site called REKNEW.ORG, the ""biblical definition"" looks like this: ""Scripture portrays humans as having minds and wills of their own. They are, in a real (though limited) sense, creators of their own behavior and determiners of their own destinies""whether this behavior and destiny is in line with God""s will or not."" See more at: http://reknew.org... So it doesn't sound too bad right? But we dig deeper into this claim... Determiners of their own destinies... He's saying that NO ONE ELSE DETERMINES YOUR DESTINY! We decide our ultimatum and God cannot stop that! But... What about Exodus 9? ""But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses."" So... God hardened pharaoh's heart? Sounds like pharaoh didn't have free will. If he did he would harden his own heart, right? Also. The Lord's Prayer! Think about it... ""Let YOUR (God's) will be done on earth as it is in heaven."" Not MY will be done. There are some times where I am confused because people who believe in Free Will make God seem like a ""deist"" God, which means he is no longer involved in our lives and we just do EVERYTHING ourselves. ""But now, O Lord, You are our Father, we are the clay, and You our potter; and all of us are the work of Your hand"" (Is. 64:8). As we see in Isaiah, WE ARE NOT THE POTTER AND THE CLAY. God is the potter and we are the clay and He can do with us whatever His good plan has for us. ""The king""s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He wishes"" (Prov. 21:1). This is another example of God doing whatever he pleases and intervening with our ""free will..."" Man... This free will thing doesn't seem so free to me. ""I know, O Lord, that a man""s way is not in himself, nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps"" (Jer. 10:23). Again... Another verse where God is the ultimate control of where a man ultimately goes. 3. IS THERE PROOF OF PREDESTINATION IN THE BIBLE? Let's pull out the key verses of predestination, shall we? Ephesians 1:4-5 ""Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will."" Romans 8: 28-30 ""And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified."" John 6:44 ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day."" 2 Timothy 1:9 ""He has saved us and called us to a holy life""not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time..."" Ephesians 1:11-12 ""In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory."" These are just a few verses that explain my point. I would love to see if my opponent has any Bible verses that specifically say ""Free Will"". It's funny that the Bible has the word ""predestined"" but not ""free will"" and yet the majority of Christians believe in the latter. Good luck to my opponent and I am looking forward to discussing this with you."	PRO	47

Even according to your definition- Omniscience - God is all knowing all the time. God knows everything, including bad things. - God creates human and then creates water for human to survive. We can see that in both ways that God has no choice (free will) . --If god did not create water, then human can""t survive. + God has no choice but to create water in order to let human survive. +If HE does not do that, then mankind can""t survive. HE has no choice but to do that. According to the Book of Genesis, God created water before creating mankind. =An omnibenevolent God cannot have free will because there is only one perfect course of action, which God, being perfectly good, must follow. God is all powerful, and invented perfection. Therefore, may decide what is perfect, or change what is considered perfect based on his own choices. Which means sufferings are also in God's control. Then, he is no longer God because HE allows sufferings. You defined God, not me. You are only arguing with your own definition. There is something that God, therefore HE is not powerful. While the meaning is not clear here, it is apparenty you are again arguing with your own definition- Omnipotent - God is all powerful, sovereign. Arguments Obviously, when you are all powerful, you can do anything, even change aspects of yourself. And Ominpotent being has the ablity to make itself not ominbenevolent or omniscient. Omnipotence, in and of itself, allows you to do anything. Anything. Ominpotence would allow God to forgo any logic, even being able to change anything about logic to fit his own design."	PRO	49

However, You have made a very bold proclamation, ""Free will is an illusion"", In my mind, If you want people to take that seriously, You must put something behind it.

S11be5eba-A187dab7b	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	For my argument I will argue two positions. The first will be that the robots which I described are acting morally when they rape, pillage, murder, ext. The second will be that human beings are incapable of acting morally. AP 1: Morality is conformity to the right rules of conduct. This is simply the agreed upon definition of morality. If my opponent wishes to argue over the interpretation of this definition, that would be fine. AP 2: Being programmed for a specific purpose, robots become moral agents. To validate this premise, we must look at what a moral agent is. A moral agent is generally defined as a being capable of acting in a right or wrong way. Since robots have a set purpose, they are capable of acting in a right way(killing, raping) or in a wrong way(not killing or raping). Whether they actually have free will over the matter is not important in this case because the criteria of moral agency is simply to be capable of acting in a right or wrong way. A robot can act in a wrong way by simply malfunctioning or breaking. Also, it being generally accepted that humans are capable of acting in a right or wrong way while the debate over they have free will is still ongoing is testament to free will not being necessary for moral agency. AP 3: Robots are fulfilling their purpose by killing, raping, ext. and so are acting in regards to right conduct. If their purpose is to kill, rape, ext. and they kill, rape, ext. then they are logically fulfilling their purpose. AC 1: By fulfilling their initial purpose, robots are conforming to the right rules of conduct and so are acting morally.--- From Ap 1, 2, and 3. BP 1: Humans have no objective purpose to follow in terms of right or wrong conduct. To challenge this premise, my opponent simply needs to provide a normative ethical claim that is able to bypass the is-ougt problem. Meaning that it is able to go from an 'is'( how the world is) to an 'ought'( how one should act). BC 1: Humans are incapable of acting in either a right or wrong way.--- From AP 1 and BP 1. This is the obvious conclusion one would draw when a non-subjective purpose is needed in order to act morally, and there is no non-subjective purpose. Therefore humans are incapable of acting morally. I will go into further detail as the debate progresses and when I see the specific objections Con brings.	PRO	51
See8b9e88-Af2285630	Free will is an illusion	After reading your initial thesis thoroughly, I find that we can only agree on one thing. I also believe that this question has a fairly simple answer. Yes, Of course we have free will, Our lives depend on the choices that we consciously make every day of our lives. The idea that we have no control over what we want and need is absolutely ridiculous, It is only a clever ploy to rid one of the responsibilities of his/her actions.	CON	52
Sba20820a-A33810d51	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"Free will is an illusion. Every action is caused by previous events, hence, no action can be freely chosen. Immanuel Kant writes : ""If one takes attributes of existence of things in time for attributes of things in themselves, which is the usual way of thinking, the necessity in the causal relation can in no way be united with freedom. They are contradictory to each other, for the former implies that every event, and consequently every action which occurs at a certain point of time, is necessary under the condition of what preceded it. Since the past is no longer in my power, every action which I perform is necessary because of determining grounds which are not in my power. That means that at the time I act I am never free."" In addition, before the human consciousness willingly takes an action the unconsciousness of the brain has already begun that action. Since the free will of humans has no control of the unconsciousness, human actions are necessarily deterministic. Benjamin Libet writes, ""Our experimental evidence, described in Chapter 2, showed that activations of the sensory cortex have to proceed for up to about 500 msec to produce awareness of a sensory signal. When the duration of the luminal stimulus to the sensory cortex was reduced below the threshold --- such as 400 msec or even 450 msec – no sensory awareness was reported. The subjects reported, ""I felt nothing."" A similar situation was found for trains of stimulus pulses applied to specific ascending sensory pathway in the brain; this is the fast pathway from the medulla to cerebral cortex. In spite of this presumed actual delay in the awareness of the boy and the ball for up to 500 msec, you are capable of slamming on the break in about 150 msec or less after the [the boy appeared. That action, therefore, must be performed unconsciously, without awareness. Amazingly, your delayed awareness can be automatically but subjectively antedated, or referred back in time, so you would report seeing the boy immediately. Stepping on the brake is not a simple spinal reflex. It involves recognizing the nature of the signal and a decision to act, in order not to hit him. This fairly complex mental function is carried out unconsciously. We were able to examine this issue experimentally. What we found, in short, was that the brain exhibited an initiating process, beginning 550 msec before the freely voluntary act; but awareness of the conscious will to perform the act appeared only 150—200 msec before the act. The voluntary process is therefore initiated unconsciously, some 400 msec before the subject becomes aware of her will or intention to perform the act."" According to the law of the excluded middle, every statement must either be true or false, regardless of time frame. The implication is that even though humanity has no access to this knowledge, the future is already predetermined because all statements regarding the future are already determined to be either true or false from the beginning of time. Alessandro Becchi explains ""Historically, several different formulations of the principle of the excluded middle have been given; here we'll adopt the following: every proposition is either true or false, that is, it possesses one and only one of the two truth values, truth and falsity. In this sense the principle of the excluded middle amounts to the so called ‘principle of bivalence'. If we consider future-tensed sentences, this logical principle seems to entail determinism. Take for instance the sentence ï¿½Tomorrow noon Bin Laden will be captured by the American soldiersï¿½, as uttered today; according to the excluded middle such a sentence expresses a proposition that is already now true or false. But if such proposition is already true today then it seems that the fact at issue must necessarily occur tomorrow (analogously if the proposition is false). Really, it doesn't matter at all if such a sentence is actually uttered or thought by someone or not; it seems to be in the very nature of the case whether the fact described by such a sentence will occur or not. And such a fact would be ‘decided' from all eternity."""	PRO	53

Sf1aaf9c4-Aa986f971	Predestination (Pro/For) vs. Free Will (Con/Against)	"I have a feeling that my opponent may or may not know what Predestination is, so I am going to give him the definition for it so he can fully understand. ""PREDESTINATION is the biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved."" http://www.gotquestions.org... This is Predestination in a nutshell. I am now going to analyze my opponent's argument in a very specific and biblical way. ""If we do not have free will, then none of us could be at a fault for what we do. But then there could be no sin without free will, as in order to sin you must be morally culpable for your action. And if there is no sin, what does Christ redeem us from? Nothing."" My opponent believes that predestination states that everything we do is predestined... Meaning we are like puppets. This is inaccurate and I will explain why. Predestination is a broad term, but specifically used in the Bible to describe the coming to salvation. Meaning, the word predestination can mean that God predetermined some things to happen to some people, but in the case of salvation, he handled everything. ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. John 6:44 It is with this informatoin that we can then go to Romans 8:28 - ""And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified."" In this case, the parallel between Romans and John is called and drawed. They are the same thing in this case, which means that only the ones the Lord calls will he justify and glorify, meaning God doesn't call everyone nor draw everyone. The Bible does teach that we have a WILL, but Free Will is a completely different subject. Free Will means that God does not interfere with our actions and that we have the ability to do anything we want at anytime, and basically God can't do anything about it. That is unbiblical. As I stated in my previous argument, God hardened Pharoah's heart, which violated Pharoah's free will. God doesn't predestine every person's actions, because then he would predestine sin, which would go against his character like my opponent stated. We do have a will, but FREE WILL is a whole different story which there is no biblical evidence for. My opponent needs to provide Biblical Evidence for free will, because a 70 word argument isn't going to win him the debate. I have evidence for my case and so far he hasn't given any except his subjective stance."	PRO	55
S11be5eba-A7b1c27bc	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	"Rejection of AP 2 My opponent believes that the is-ought problem is being inconsistently applied to humans but not to robots. However the difference between humans and robots in this scenario is that humans were not made for a purpose while the robots were. It is therefore possible for the robots to deviate from what they 'ought' to do and therefore they can be moral or immoral. As to my opponent's example of a printer, I agree that it has no moral obligation to do what it was programmed to do, however not doing the thing that was the point of it's programming is wrong according to an objective code of what it 'ought' and 'ought not' to do. BP 1: Overcoming the is-ought gap My opponent then believes that humans are able to get around the is-ought problem. However his argument has much to be desired in that it's main premise relies on the idea that ""If I want to bring about X, then I ought to do Y"". His critique that he brought against robots being capable of morality was that there was nothing objective about it. But then he builds a human response to the is-ought problem completely out of subjective feelings? If 'ought' truly is conditional(which it cannot be if we are speaking of 'objective' purpose) then morality is simply a clash of wills. It is an inconsistent philosophy that cannot be applied universally, thus contradicting itself seeing as it draws heavily on Kant. Summing up At the end of his case, Con points out two reasons which he believes will lead voters to reject my argument. They are as follows. 1. Pro has provided no grounds for thinking robots have objective moral purpose, and has contradicted his reason for rejecting human centered morality in doing so My grounds for objective moral purpose are exactly what separates human and robot morality. Robots are designed to fulfill a certain purpose, and in going against it are doing what they 'ought not' to do. This is why humans are incapable of 'objective' morality. To be objective, something must be existant without opinion. My opponent's morality is completely derived though from subjective values. 2. He has not provided good reason to believe that humans cannot have objective moral standards. As I exaplained above, objective means true without regards to opinion. Humans came about with no regards to an objective purpose and so any such values that one derives are completely subjective. 3 minutes to spare!"	PRO	56

S5990b6b8-Ae3666c60	All humans ought to assume that the Christian God does not exist, based on lack of evidence.	Thanks for accepting, Con. Both scientific observation and Christianity attempt to explain the physical and natural world. Christianity assumes that the direct reason things exist in the first place is an omnipotent being, God. The most widely accepted theory of the universe among astrophysicists is that of the Big Bang theory, rather than that of Christian creation (1). A being capable of doing whatever it wants at any given time (omnipotent), if proven to exist, would render any existing scientific theories and evidence for things such as creation refutable, as whatever an omnipotent being wills to exist must come to exist (2). Christianity is not the only religion in the world. In proving itself to be correct, Christianity would prove all other religions, including those that believe in the existence of omnipotent beings, wrong. The burden of proof, therefore, rests not only on those who believe in the existence of the omnipotence of a being, but also on the specific group of theists known as Christians, who believe in the existence of the omnipotent being described in the Bible, the Christian holy book. Science the study of the natural and physical world (3). Any religion is a standpoint on the aspects of the physical and natural world, as religions believe certain things to exist. Thus, as humans are the ones to whom scientific study and religion are of interest, and because humans have a limited ability to observe the physical and natural world, humans are forced to base their beliefs on limited observation. If there were complete certainty of the existence of an omnipotent being (SPECIFICALLY the Christian God), this debate would not be taking place. If there were complete certainty of the non-existence of an omnipotent being (SPECIFICALLY the Christian God), this debate would not be taking place. Scientific laws are backed up by scientific observation, and have always been able to predict outcomes with certainty (4). As scientific laws have always proven useful, we must conclude that science, to an extent, is useful. BASED ON THE LIMITED OBSERVATIONS OF HUMANS, FACTS WHICH DO NOT CONTRADICT OTHER FACTS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS VALID, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER OPTIONS, BECAUSE ALL THAT HUMANS CLAIM TO BE KNOWLEDGE IS BASED ON LIMITED OBSERVATION. Christianity contradicts every other religion, thus Christianity cannot yet be accepted as valid. The burden of proof rests on Christians in this case. The concept of an omnipotent being is not yet validated by any current observation of the natural world which has always proven to be useful or does not contradict other observations to which the usefulness applies. The burden of proof rests not only on Christians, but those who believe in the existence of an omnipotent being. In any case, belief in the Christian God is not valid until the Christian God is not scientifically proven to exist, because science is based on observation that is proven to be useful. To sum my argument up: -Prove that there is an omnipotent being, -And prove that this being is the Christian God, -All scientifically, And humans will have valid cause to be believe in the Christian God. As this proof has not yet been presented on either count, of Christianity or omnipotence, humans should put their faith in that which has always proven to be useful in the past- that which is the most valid of human knowledge- that which is evidenced by observation of the natural world- science. Humans should believe as they discover, and treat that which rejects currents observations as false until it is assimilated into observations that support others and are useful.

Good luck to you, may the best debator win, and please, in regards to those who will judge this debate, do so unbiased. Now, enough of the formalities. I negate the resolution. Be it resolved that an omnipotent omniscient creator of the world can coexist with free will. ""[11]If someone knows everything, and created everything, then they know what they have created. God knows about every blade of grass and every leaf.[11] [22]He placed them there. He structured all the brains of every human. If a soul exists, he created every bit of it. [22] [33]Everything is in his knowledge, all of which he made. Therefore, nothing can be operating outside of his control. All that he made he has a plan for and nothing can divert from that plan. To divert from God's plan would be to trick the all knowing. It would be operating outside of his realm, which is the entire universe.[33]"" I believe that was the gist of my opponent's argument. Let me break this down. As you'll see, I have placed numbers within my opponent's speech thus making it easier to break down. 11) That is an excellent point, however, just because He knows everything he created does not mean he dictates what they do. For instance, I create a toaster. If that toaster were to malfunction on it's own, is that my doing? Say I built that toaster to par but I never used it. After some time, it is unable to toast at all. Is this my fault? (And yes, I realise that's not how a toaster works, it was just a silly analogy) 22) Let us look to the Christian faith, as you have already used it as an example. The Bible speaks of us as beings of the flesh (being succeptable to sin). Since God does not cause us to sin, nor does he tempt us, we must have some free will, yes? Also, into any other monotheistic religion, there is typically an antagonist, a devil, Satan, Deceiver, or a Xenu of sorts. This being said, we are then given a choice. 33) What if it was God's will for us to have a choice? I can know a ladybug is going to move when touched but that doesn't necessarily mean I will control it. Don't get me wrong, I may choose to interfere at any time, the same goes for an omnipotent omnipresent God. Now, with all that aside, I can get to my one and only contention not having to do with my opponent's argument... For the most part... My opponent argues that MAN cannot have free will whereas the resolution clearly states: ""If God is the omnipotent and omniscient creator of the world, then complete free will is impossible"" I propose to you that even IF, not to contend my own contentions, man had no free will, said creator would, thereby meaning there is complete free will. For the above reasons and refutations, I strongly urge a CON ballot. Thanks, -EG"	CON	61
Sba20820a-A8e18bc49	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"For clarity, I will be defending my arguments in the same order that my opponent discusses them. First, regarding the argument about the subconscious, it is important to note that my opponent neglects to respond to the substance of the argument; rather he argues that the subconscious or unconsciousness of the human brain is still within our definition of ""self"". I will concede that the self is centered in the brain. However, this does not necessarily mean that we have full control of the self. My argument regarding the subconscious simply states that all actions of the self are determined by subconscious thoughts, of which we have no control over. Hence, even though the subconsciousness is part of the self, it is not a part that we can freely control. The implication is that we have no control of our wills. Next, regarding the causality argument, my opponent presents two examples. His first example, regarding going to the bathroom after a murder, argues that we can take random actions that are not caused by previous actions. However, this argument is flawed because he assumes I am only talking about one previous cause. It is true that my going to the bathroom has no relation to my committing a murder, but that action is still caused by my previous drinking of water, which in turn is caused by events further back. My opponent's second example discusses the human ability to ignore our impulses, such as choosing to ignore my hunger in the wake of more crucial needs. However, I would argue that this ignoring of hunger is simply an effect of other past events. Hence, even if we ignore one impulse, we are still acting in a way that is determined by past events, since these events influence our reasoning. The final argument I present is the argument from truth and falsity. This logical argument states that every event must either happen or not happen. My opponent misunderstands this argument and argues that we can never predict whether an event will happen or not. However, this does not matter. Take for instance, the statement ""I will murder someone on Dec 16. 2007"" Regardless of whether I know it or not, that statement must be true or false. In addition, the truth or falsity of this statement is determined regardless of time frame because of the nature of truth. An inherently true statement cannot become false. Thus, if the preceding example is true, then it is true today, tomorrow, or before I was born. Hence, I cannot be said to have freely chosen that action if that action was determined to happen years before I even existed. Regarding my opponents last notes, he argues that we can never know the past. However, I have shown logical and empirical proof that free will is flawed. My first argument shows experimental evidence showing how the conscious ""choice"" is in fact controlled by unconscious chemical actions in our brains, which we have no control over. The causality argument shows that the current state of the world is causally determined by past states, and the logical determinist argument proves that through the nature of language, the future is already determined from the beginning of time, despite the fact that humanity will never possess this knowledge."	PRO	62
S6acab37e-A93fd37f8	Free will is an illusion	"My opponents claim seems to spring a leak, as soon as he/she brings the idea of impulses and tendencies into the argument. To claim that we cannot control our impulses is rather short sighted. When we are acting ""impulsive"", we are acting without reason or rationality, but those impulses only prove to merely influence our emotions. Influence is not the same as control. My opponent will need to convince us that we do not ever have control of our choice to act reasonable, or impulsive in any given situation. I think my opponent has made the mistake of not recognizing the sequence of events that governs our actions. Lets say an object is heading straight toward you at a great speed, you use your senses to understand the situation. Your eyes see the object and sends that information to your brain ( its a large rock). At this moment, you have a choice to act rational, or impulsive. Since past circumstances have not gone well when you stood still and tried to reason with the rock, you decide to forego the rational choice and get rather impulsive and just in the nick of time you're able to evade a collision with a large rock. Just because this sequence of events seems to happen instantaneously, doesn't mean it happened outside of our ability to control our function. Our memory is superb with categorizing our emotions and relating it with circumstances that are happening now. Because we can remember how we felt the last time a large hunk of pumice raced toward our head, we have an emotional blueprint for instant( or what seems to be instant) reference to base our decision from. Just because this phenomenon seems instantaneous, it gives us the illusion of some other force at work that we cannot control. If you're going to argue that instinct is at work, and we can't control that, then I will ask you to reconsider what instict is. Some may believe we are born with instinctual capabilities, but how do you think a newborn would have faired with the large rock. That newborn has no past emotions to help it make a conscious decision of what to do. Is instinct really something we are born with, or is it an illusion made up of our emotional blueprint? Not to say I don't believe in instinct, I just question our perception of what instinct is and where it truly comes from. If my opponent is going to argue that we have no control over our emotions, I will concede that point to him/her, but if my opponent is going to argue that we are governed by our emotions, then this will be a short debate. Science and philosophy are pretty much on the same page when it comes to using emotions as a guide for our decisions. It's a bad idea to do so!!!! In fact, it may not be possible to make decisions or actions based solely on our emotions. Lets say I come home one day to find my house engulfed in flames, my instincts tell me that it's not going to be a pleasant experience if I go into my house, that emotion in this circumstance would be considered "" self preservation"". However, I have kitties and I know that my life would be meaningless and empty without them (Ya, I'm only one cat shy of being a crazy cat lady). Now, I have two contrasting emotions to tassel with, and whether I choose to save my cats, or save myself, I will either be acting in contrast to my emotions of self preservation, or in contrast to my emotional attachment to my pretty kitties. Bottom line is, we are not governed by our emotions, we can and do act contrary to our emotions."	CON	63
Sba20820a-Aacf3ccac	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"First, my opponent argues that we are able to control all aspects of the ""self"". However, this is empirically denied. I cannot claim to control my sense of hunger, since hunger is determined by the amount of food in my stomach and not any semblance of ""free will"". Similarly, we cannot control the parts of the autonomic nervous system, i.e. breathing, heartbeat even though these actions are determined by the synapses in the brain. Hence, the argument that we can freely control all parts of our ""self"" is simply false. To summarize my first argument, I provided experimental evidence that showed that all ""decisions"" made by the human consciousness are actually determined by events of the unconsciousness, and hence cannot be controlled. Because all our decisions are already made by the unconsciousness prior to our awareness, it is impossible for us to ever control these decisions. Second, my opponent argues that despite the fact that my going to the bathroom is caused by my drinking of water, it is not caused by all past events. he argues that ""every action would need to be effected by every preceding event."" or else determinism would be false. This is flawed, as he admits, because if an action is caused by ONE previous event, then it is out of human control. This is sufficient to prove determinism true. My opponent's next point argues that a person could just randomly not go to the bathroom even though he needs to. My opponent claims this would be possible, but that fact seems to be a claim at best and lacks any warrant. More over, even if it were possible for such a random thing to happen, it would not be a conscious choice, which is defined as a decision based upon reason. A reason would be caused by a past event. Hence, even if my opponent wins his argument that random things can happen, such an event would not qualify as ""free will"" and hence does nothing in this debate. Finally, my opponent contests that things cannot be true prior to it happening. I will admit that this argument may seem a little counter-intuitive or confusing, but the nature of language and logic means that everything must be true or false. My opponent argues that there is always a shadow of doubt, and that there is possibility. However, these arguments reference what we KNOW about a statement, not the inherent truth value of it. I conceded that it impossible to know whether things are true or false, but it has to be one or the other nonetheless. My opponent mistakes the distinction between ontology, or what things are, and epistemology, or what we know. Going back to the example, if I will kill someone on a certain date, regardless of what happens between now and then, I either will or will not. At any point in time, I can't be both going to and not going to. Hence, the inherent truth of that statement is already determined, because things have to be either true or false. If, like my opponent argues, a car kills me at the last second before I commit a murder, then the statement ""i will kill someone on X date"" is false regardless of time, and the statement ""I will get run over on X date"" is true. As a final note, I understand that determinism is a pretty counter-intuitive argument and philosophy. However, through logic and evidence, we can see beyond mere perception and illusion and see that in fact, free will is a mere illusion."	PRO	64
S88b62b30-A87ef360a	The Bible is free of contradiction	"Thank you Con for accepting this debate. I would also like to thank you for using a capitol G and H to refer to God and His. I accept all definitions. I shall respond to each supposed contradiction in the order as they have been presented. They shall be numbered 1-12. 1. Order of Creation - Beasts before Man or Man before Beasts? My opponent uses 2 verses, Genesis 1:25 and Genesis 2:19, to show a contradiction in the order in which animals and Man were created. Con misinterprets the texts. In Genesis 1:25, the Hebrew word for “made” is “way-ya-as” meaning to make or to do. This word is used to describe what one does as something is happening, as in the present tense. (See the source listed “1”) However, in Genesis 2:19, the word is “way-yi-ser”, meaning “had formed”. This word is used to describe a reestablishment of the events that have already occurred.(See the source listed “2”) This shows that the two verses do not contradict, because they are not telling two different creation accounts. The verse in Genesis 2 is simply retelling the events that have occurred in Genesis 1. 2. The Last Words of Jesus This argument is much more common in the realm of supposed Biblical contradictions. Each of the three verses concern the words that Jesus spoke before he died, and each gives a separate account of the words which were said. The answer is simple...He said all of them. Each Gospel has a different structure of Jesus, where some things Jesus says are mentioned in all four, others in only three, some in only two, and a few are even special just to one single Gospel. Jesus received the wine, cried out to God ""Why have you forsaken me?"", shouted ""I entrust my spirit"", bowed His head, and died. No contradiction, one must simply put each Gospel on top of the other. 3. To Answer or Not to Answer? This verse threw me for a loop for a minute, how could one verse say one thing and the next verse say a completely different thing? Surely the author must have known. But that's where it got to me. The author must of known because he did know, he used these seemingly conflicting verses for a reason. In verse 4, The Proverb warns us to not answer a fool or we will be like the fool. In verse 5, The Proverb tells us to answer a fool or he will think of himself as wise. Verse 4 pertains to a situation in which the fool does not want to learn, because attempting to teach a fool who does not want to be taught is foolish in itself. Verse 5 pertains to a situation in which the fool will learn, and so that we should answer such a fool so that he does not consider himself to be wise. The verses are complimentary. No contradiction. 4. Does God Change His Mind? This question has been debated for quite awhile, actually. It has many theological implications. However, the verse given by Con is Genesis 6:6, where God regrets and grieves for having made man. This is something called anthropomorphic revelation, where in which God emphasizes his position through human characteristics. God does not change in this situation, but his ""feelings"" about man did change temporally. This is not God changing his mind, for He allows man to exist through Noah. This does not show any sort of change in mind by God, and therefore is not a contradiction. 5. Jesus and Testifying Con is simply misreading the text. In Deuteronomy 19:15, we read the following: ""One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses"" Jesus, in the verse prior, is showing how to properly judge Himself. He is referring to this law to show that He is unable to bear His own witness in context of The Law. This is why Jesus calls upon John to testify for Him in the next verses. 6. Did Saul's Companions Hear ""The Voice""? Yes, they did hear the voice, but they did not understand it. For this, we must dive back into the original language...this time it's Greek. The Greek word for ""hearing"" in Acts 9:7 is ""akouontes"", meaning actually to hear. However, in Matthew 13:13 the phrase is used to describe a distinction between hearing and understanding. (See sources ""3""and ""4"" below) In Acts 22:9. the word is ""ekousan"" meaning also to hear. However, this word is used in Matthew 13:15 to recite Isaiah's words about those who do not understand what is being spoken to them. (See sources ""5"" and ""6"" below) The point being made here is that they did hear the voice of Jesus, but they did not understand what He was saying. Only Saul understood Him. 7. God Changing His Mind- Revisited Con states that God changes His mind by changing the time of Adam's death...from the day that he sins to hundreds of years later. This is simply a misunderstanding of the texts, once again. The death of Adam did occur on the day that he sinned, because this is the day in which he was separated from God. Adam is now dead in his spirit. This is why when we receive Christ, we are born again. However, Adam also lost his privilege to The Tree of Life that day, which means that he was cursed to die as a result of his sin. 8. How did Saul die? Suicide. The Israelites had just been defeated by The Philistines, so when the Amalekite man found Saul's crown and armlet, he decided to get to Saul's right-hand man, David. When he got to David, he told him that he killed Saul out of mercy and brought the crown and armlet as evidence. The Amalekite man knew David had slaughtered his people, and he was hoping to be rewarded by David for bringing him the crown and putting Saul out of his misery. The story was fabricated. It makes no sense for an Amalekite man to kill an Israelite king during a huge battle between The Israelites and The Philistines. Simply reading 1 Samuel 31 and 2 Samuel 1 should be enough reason to accept this, so I'll put links to both chapters in numbers ""7"" and ""8"". 9. Language in Ancient Times This was intriguing. See, the Earth as depicted by the author was based off of all of which could have been seen. Since this was shortly after the flood, the peoples affected would have have had but one language. 10. The Ten Plagues Seeing as though the person who started the thread in the link is ""Missy"", I will guess that Con is the one who gave both theories from that thread. I will need sources for both of them in order to continue. 11. Herod and His Commands I actually had never seen this sort of contradiction before. However, it should be noted that this was no mass slaughtering. Bethlehem was a scarcely populated city of only a few thousand at the time. The number of infants who could have been killed was not too many, therefore it would be odd if Josephus recorded such a ""usual"" act of such a mad King. 12. Fasting for 40 days? Yes, Jesus was hungry. Very, very hungry. That is why he was tempted. However, there are verified accounts of people starving for 40 days. (See link ""9"") Once again, I thank Con for providing these challenges. They were very fun and intellectually stimulating to counter. Feel free to rebut any or all of my answers, and also feel free to provide as many more supposed contradictions as you would like. However, I do ask you to keep it within practical limits. It takes more characters to respond to a claim than it does to make a claim. Good Luck.

Sba20820a-A4dfb8433	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"To first reiterate, we are controlling all aspects of the self, just not consciously. ANything inside you is the self. You may not be realize it but you are telling yourself ""be hungry, breathe, pump blood"", via the natural systems in your brain for the good of the body. Its just developed to a point where it is redundant and automatic, thus you do not need to be direct control over it. The body is elegant and complex enough where it can take some matters in its own hands, yes, but it is still never the less, irrevocably you. The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Meaning that even if you don't know it, its still happening, and your still doing it to yourself. I disagree with your assumption that I gave up on this point because of a ""determinism realization"" I merely feel that I did not present my point well enough. I conclude the point by saying that one previous action is not sufficient evidence that all man's fate is set out before him. It is not illogical for anything to base its actions by a previous one, but saying that this trait forfeits a being having its own will is. I will not provide extra evidence as this is the last round. The bathroom argument does not need warrant as it is pure common sense and knowledge. Also, the last example was about eating, but I digress. If a mans urinary needs where strictly controlled by the subconscious than we would just go anytime we feel the need to relive ourselves, however, we have the ability to ""hold it in"". Anyone who's been on a road trip knows this. We wait until there is a suitable opportunity, not for our bladders, but for our pride. The body's best interest would be to evacuate the waste, but our conscious selves deny our body and purposefully bring pain to ourselves. I believe this sounds like a conscious choice, no? Our subconscious, as I explained before, works in the body's interests, not so much the mind. While there are many aspects we cannot control, simply because we need not to, we can make choices, most apparently in our bad ones. But as I said before, it is still us making that choice, consciously or not. My final claim, is not constricted by what we know. The nature of language and logic means that everything is true or false correct? I do not say this is wrong, but merely nothing can be true or false until it has actually happened. It is also not restricted by what we know, it applies to the whole universe. An animal has died in the woods. No human will ever know about it, never the less, it is still true that it is dead. Prior to its death, however, there was the possibility, no matter how slim, that this beast would never die. It could theoretically live forever. When the animal was alive, it was true that it was alive, and false that it was dead. It could continue to be that way, as nothing can be certain in this creatures life until it has happened. It could vanish and never be heard from again anywhere in the universe, just like that. It could go walking on forever. Or die. In this case, it did die. Now it is true that it is dead, and false that it is alive. Until it has finally died, it cannot be said that it will die, even if all usual methods of reason, like the observation of a disease or old age, are taken into consideration. Thus, I am not saying that the ""nature of language and logic"" theory is incorrect, quite the contrary, but nothing can be true until it actually is. Free will is not an illusion, and it is not a fact. Neither is it truth or lie. AT the moment, it is a theory, a belief. As I said in the first round, until we find a definite means to discover both the future and past, nothing is certain. However, I believe I've given sufficient evidence to point out that free will is highly likely to be true at the moment. But anything is possible. Thank you Los_Altos_JW for this debate, it was a pleasure. I wish I could have been more a person to you, but it takes different strokes to rule the world. To the audience: I hope that you will not vote in accordance to your own personal belief, but to the better argument, be it mine or Mr. Altos. Darth_Grievous_42 out."	CON	66
S113e39e8-Ad66cf5c9	God cannot be morally good while giving humans free will	I kind of figured since his account is not active anymore.	PRO	67
S11be5eba-A9c9e4c16	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	On AP2 Con, in his refutation of AP 2, does not seem to understand what morality is and thus, who is capable of it. Morality is conforming to the right rules of conduct. The robots in this scenario were built for a specific purpose and thus, if they do it correctly, they are conforming their objective code of conduct and are thus acting morally. The fact that the robots were created for a purpose is both a descriptive and a normative fact in this case. The descriptive fact that they were designed for a specific purpose entails a normative fact(that they ought to kill humans). If they do not kill then they are not conforming to the right rules of conduct. Overcoming the is - ought gap Con argues that while the base of any hypothetical imperative is based subjectively, conforming to it could be measured objectively. However when the base of a moral code is itself subjective, conforming to it would in any case be based off of subjectivity. The difference between a hypothetical imperative for robots and a hypothetical imperative for robots is that humans make their own hypothetical imperative based on their subjective preferences while the hypothetical imperative set forth for robots is set by those who designed them and so is on a different plane entirely. A printer does not have an 'obligation' to print because it is completely inanimate. The robots described have at least a degree of sentience.	PRO	68
S11be5eba-Abb333bca	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	I will be taking two routes in this debate, both of which I think are sufficient to defeat Pro's argument. 1: Rejection of AP 2. Oddly, Pro seems to have a massive contradiction in his round. He argues that humans have no objective purpose because of Hume's so called 'is-ought' gap. Now, I will demonstrate that this gap can be (fairly trivially) overcome shortly, but let me first point out that this argument applies in the exact same way to Pro's robots! The descriptive ('is') fact that the robots were designed for killing and murdering does not endow them with objective moral standards, any more than the fact that humans happen to have evolved to act in certain ways endows them with objective standards. Pro has not only failed to provide grounds for thinking his hypothetical robots have objective moral purpose, but in doing so has explicitly contradicted his argument against humans having moral standards. Pro seems to have a very odd understanding of moral objectivity: a being has morally objective facts if it was programmed in some way to perform certain actions. This is clearly false - a printer does not have a objective moral obligation to print just because it was programmed to print. BP 1: Overcoming the is-ought gap. Say I define morality, as J.S. Mill, the classic political and ethical philosopher did: a form of utilitarian hedonism, where one ought to act to maximise universal happiness, often with respect to certain rules established to generally promote general happiness. So we have a stipulative definition for morality. Now here's the trick: how does one establish that one 'ought' to be moral, given that definition? It takes the form of a 'hypothetical imperative', an idea elucidated by Kant [1], which looks like this: If I want to bring about X, then I ought to do Y. For example: If I want to keep my car in good condition, I ought to take it to the local mechanics once in a while. The 'ought' is conditional on us willing a certain end, and once this end is willed it becomes an empirical matter as to how one ought to bring it about. Therefore, once we gave any given example of 'good conduct' in mind, we can overcome Hume's gap like this: If I want to act according to the moral principles stipulated, I ought to work to maximise happiness (or whatever). Now, as the why one would want to do that: that's a different debate, and one which would require us to be careful about what kind of moral system we choose. However, all that Pro has required I do to overcome this point is overcome Hume's 'is-ought' gap and provide an objective moral standard (hedonistic utilitarianism) according to which human *could* in principle be moral. To sum, we have two strong reasons to reject to Pro side of the debate: 1. Pro has provided no grounds for thinking robots have objective moral purpose, and has contradicted his reason for rejecting human centered morality in doing so and 2. He has not provided good reason to believe that humans cannot have objective moral standards. Thank you for reading. ^^ [1] http://www.moralphilosophy.info...	CON	69
S11be5eba-A8d1928db	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	What the heck. I've no idea where Pro is going with this, but I hope it'll be a good debate! My argument will be simple: According to the vast majority of accepted accounts of 'right conduct' (I hope Pro will elaborate on this next round, but I reserve the right to challenge his definitions since 'right conduct' was not defined in the first round) 'murdering, torturing, raping, pillaging, stabbing, purple nurpling, and other varieties of hurtful deeds' are considered immoral. We have three choices: 1. The robots are not moral agents and are thus amoral. Humans have the capability to be moral and refrain from immorality. Humans therefore are capable of being more moral than robots are capable of being. 2. The robots are performing immoral actions, and humans at the very least have the capability to refrain from performing those acts to the same extent or at all, so humans are capable of being more moral than robots. 3. Morality does not exist. I'm not sure about this because R1 seems to assume the existence of morality, but if this is true then neither robots nor humans are any more moral than each other and the resolution is negated by virtue of that fact.

S88b62b30-Ad33a19e9	The Bible is free of contradiction	"In my final round, I would like to take a brief overview of the debate, and give the best case for the remaining supposed contradictions. My opponent has once again conceded her Second, Third*, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth claims. My opponent has conceded to 13 of her 16 claims (setting aside the supposed contradictions for this round). I shall answer my opponents rebuttals and new contradictions in numerical order. 1. Does God Change? Firstly, I would like to apologize. I was not understanding my opponents' thoughts on the changing of one's mind. With the definition given, it seems to me that the texts that my opponent uses to support her contradiction do not line up with the definition that she gives. The verse that my opponent gives is Genesis 6:6, which says that God regretted having made Man. However, when we read further on, we see that this may be anthropomorphism The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled It talks about God's heart, but the authors knew their God was immaterial. I say that it is reasonable to assume that the regret of God is simply a way to express God's disappointment with humanity in a context where humans can understand. If my opponent would wish to say that since God was proud of Man in one time and offended in another, that this signifies a change of opinion....keep in mind that God later sends the flood, which preserves Man to righteousness. God's feelings on Man had not changed, for God saved man. This text makes better sense as one where it attempts to give God the human quality of regret. Thus God is not actually changing his mind about the goodness of man. 2. The Ten Plagues of Egypt The source given was very informative, and after surfing around I found that it was from the author's actual book, which can be found in link ""1"". It has no reviews and the book itself is two decades old. However, as I read the portions where Marr and Mallory are mentioned, I see their work to be extremely unlikely. Their entire premise is that a type of algae killed fish, which turned the water a color of blood red. The algae growth also helps in changing the color of the water. My answer to the death of fish contributing in any way to the color of the longest river in the world can be summed up in link ""2"". But I won't hold that against them. Let us specifically concern ourselves with the algae, as it most likely contributes the most to the color. Now, the specific dinoflagellate which is referred in the link my opponent gives is Pfiesteria. Oddly enough, only one species of this genus produces toxins that are harmful to fish. That species is Pfiesteria piscicida. (See link ""3"") So now the river turning red is due to a specific species of a specific dinoflagellate. Even further still, the toxic effects of this species only works for two to five days (See link ""4"") So now the river turning red is due to a specific species of a specific dinoflagellate of which the toxic effects last for a maximum of five days, thus invalidating Exodus 7:25: Seven days passed after the Lord had struck the Nile. Even if there was some sort of super-strand of this dinoflagellate which could survive a week, my opponent has not given enough good evidence to suppose that this is what happened. Even if Exodus 7:25 didn't exist, my opponent has not given enough good evidence to suppose that this is what happened. 3. The Eighth Commandment. My opponent claims that the Israelites asking for jewels after the ninth plague is akin to someone asking for something under threat. This is simply false, as the verse clearly reads that God puts His people in favor with the Egyptians. Exodus 3:21 reads: And I will cause the Egyptians to look favorably on you. They will give you gifts when you go so you will not leave empty-handed. There is no threat here, God wills the hearts of the Egyptians to be kind towards the Israelites, paying them recompense for their many years of slave labor. 4. David's Sin This one stumped me the longest. However, I found a verse that explains it. 1 Chronicles 21:1 reads: Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to count the people of Israel. As you can see, Satan was the one whom compelled David to do this evil. Now, with that, the question becomes ""So was it God or Satan?"" Well, just like in many other places in The Bible, God allows Satan to act in order for God to achieve a greater purpose. God allows Satan to entice David, so that when David sins his faith in God will increase and he will be a better king for it. 5. Judas Wow, this takes me back. I think this might have been the first contradiction I ever answered. Judas hung himself, and his corpse fell a few days later. Due to the climate of that area, the body had decomposed to a point where when it hit the ground, it split open around the stomach, spilling his guts. Also, Judas did not die in the field. He threw the money into the Temple, which was then used on his behalf to buy a field. Conclusion: I would once again like to thank my opponent for a respectful, intelligent, and elegant debate. I will ask that my opponent to refrain from giving any new contradictions, as I will be unable to respond to them. I also hope that anyone reading this dialogue came out of it with a better understanding of The Bible. Thank You, and God Bless.

S11be5eba-A2d6ce358	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	I thank my opponent for his response. I will offer my responses to his counterpoints thusly: On AP 2 Pro points out that the robots were created for a purpose whereas the humans were not. However, this is completely irrelevant; the fact that robots were designed for a particular purpose is a descriptive fact, not a normative one. Pro's argument against humans having objective moral codes was based entirely on Hume's is - ought gap: the observation that people often illicitly move from an 'is' (slavery causes suffering) to an 'ought' (slavery is wrong). Pro falls into his own trap: he moves from an 'is' (robots were designed for killing) to an 'ought' (robots ought to kill). As far as this goes, I agree that this is a valid argument. One cannot move solely from the descriptive fact that robots are programmed to kill to the normative fact that robots ought to kill. Pro makes a confused distinction between what the printer 'ought' to do and what it has an 'obligation' to do - the very nature of an obligation is that it is something that one ought to do, so this point fails as well. Besides, it can be easily substituted - according to Pro's definition, a printer 'ought' to do what it is programmed to do. This is an obviously false consequence that reveals the failure of Pro's argument. Overcoming the is - ought gap. I will respond to Pro's misplaced response shortly - however, it is worth pointing out that even if my account of the is -ought gap fails, Pro still loses this point. For the definition provided of morality was 'conforming to the rules of right conduct'. Once one has in place an account of right conduct, it does not matter whether the is - ought gap can be crossed. For humans would still be 'moral' by conforming to these rules of right conduct and thus would be capable of being more moral than Pro's robots. However, does his critique of hypothetical imperatives succeed in any case? Not at all, because he misunderstands the nature of my claim. It is not the hypothetical imperative that is supposed to be objective in this case - the hypothetical imperative simply crosses the gap to the objective standard of morality, which was supposed to be Mill's utilitarianism. Put it this way - facts about which actions produce the most happiness are objective. There are actual, objective answers to questions of the sort 'will this action produce more happiness than suffering?' that do not depend on subjective opinion. Taking this account of right conduct, humans can hypothetically perform actions which produce more happiness than suffering and thus be moral: more moral than the robots. Now Pro's objection was that we cannot cross the gap from the statement 'X action will produce more happiness than harm' to the statement 'I ought to do X'. Now, this has nothing to do with whether or not humans can be moral - but whether there is any reason they ought to be moral. My claim was that this can be achieved with a hypothetical imperative - which is itself subjective (how could motivation be anything else?) but is used to provide a reason to conform to the objective standard of morality, thus crossing the is - ought gap.

S88b62b30-A46f1b53	The Bible is free of contradiction	"Thank you for the challenge! Firstly, I would like to point out that because the Bible is an ancient work of literature, there will be mistakes (such as spelling or name mix-ups) due to interpretations and translations by various authors in different periods of time. So I will make an effort to not include those. For the sake of clarity (taken from Oxford dictionary): accuracy: the quality or state of being correct or precise. inaccuracy: the quality or state of not being accurate. contradiction: a combination of statements, ideas, or features of a situation that are opposed to one another. In my argument, I will be using my annotated Bible. There are countless example to expose, amassed during a summer of research. I will begin. ------ Concerning the order of the creation of Earth's inhabitants, Genesis contradicts itself. In Genesis I, God made the beasts of the earth before he created the man. [Gen 1:25] - ""And God made the wildlife of the earth after his kind, and livestock after their kind, and creatures that crawl upon the ground after his kind: and God saw that it was good."" [Gen 1:26] - ""Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, all the earth, and the creatures that crawl upon the earth'."" In Genesis 2, however, God made man before the beasts. [Gen 2:18] - ""Then the LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper as his complement'."" [Gen 2:19] - ""So the LORD God formed out of the ground every wild animal and every bird of the sky, and brought each to the man to see what he would call it."" The animals had already been made in Genesis 1. It does not make sense for God to create them again in order so that Adam could name them--which, by the way, must have taken an awful long time. ------ Concerning Jesus's last words, Matthew, Luke, and John all say different things, which wouldn't be contradictory had they, the eyewitnesses, not written such vastly different accounts. [Matthew 27:46, 50] - ""About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachtani?' that is, ""My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?' ...Jesus shouted again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit."" [Luke 23:46, 47] - ""And Jesus called out with a loud voice, 'Father, into Your hands I entrust My spirit.' Saying this, He breathed His last."" [John 19:30, 31] - ""When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 'It is finished!' Then bowing His head, He gave up His spirit."" They were all present at the crucifixion, so why is there deviation? ------ Another contradiction is seen in the Proverbs. [Proverbs 26:4] - ""Don't answer a fool according to his foolisness or you'll be like him yourself."" The very next line: [Proverbs 26:5] - ""Answer a fool according to his foolishness or he'll become wise in his own eyes."" What sense does that make? It's an obvious contradiction and a lose-lose. If you answer him, you're a fool. But if you don't, then the fool will think himself right, and that does no one good. ------ Here is a contradiction from several sources regarding whether God changes His mind. [Genesis 6:6] - ""the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grived in His heart."" [I Samuel 15:29] - ""the Eternal One of Israel does not lie or change His mind, for He is not one who changes His mind."" [Malachi 3:6] - ""Because I, Yahweh [LORD], have not changed..."" Here we have God changing His mind about humans and having Noah build his ark, but later we have God telling people that He's never changed. And there's Samuel, but he could be wrong. I digress. ------ According to John, Jesus says about bearing his own witness: [John 5:31] - ""If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid."" Yet in [John 8:14], ""Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going."" Oh, come on, Jesus. What was all that about taking the log out of your own eye before taking the speck out of your neighbor's? ------ When Saul was on the way to Damascus, he saw a light and heard a voice. Did his companions hear the voice? According to [Acts 9:7] - ""The men who were traveling with him [Saul] stood speechless, hearing the sound but seeing no one."" But later, in [Acts 22:9] - ""Now those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me."" Clearly wrong. ------ Here's another instance of God supposedly changing His mind--or outright lying. In Genesis, Adam was informed that if he ate the forbidden fruit he would die that very day. However, he lived to the ripe old age of 930. [Genesis 2:17] - ""but you must not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die."" [Genesis 5:5] - ""So Adam's life lasted 930 years; then he died."" Seriously? Not only that, but it is impossible to live for 930 years. Most people don't even make it to 100! ------ Regarding Saul's death. [I Samuel 31:4, 6] - ""Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, 'Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through or torture me.' But his armor-bearer would not do it because he was terrified. Then Saul took his sword and fell on it."" [2 Samuel 1:8, 10] - ""He [Saul] asked me, 'Who are you?' I told him: I'm an Amalekite. Then he begged me, 'Stand over me and kill me, for I'm mortally wounded, but my life still lingers.' So I stood over him and killed him because I knew that after he had fallen he couldn't survive."" ------ According to [Genesis 11:1] - ""At one time the whole earth had the same language and vocabulary."" This is impossible because around 2400BCE (at the time this is implying) there were many languages, each unintelligible to the other. ------ If you do as God says, he won't send disease or disaster down upon you like he did to the Egyptians.

For I am Yahweh who heals you."" Really? All that happened during the Ten Plagues in Egypt can be scientifically explained...here: http://forum.bible-discussion.com... ------ According to [Matthew 2:16] - ""Then Herod, when he saw that he had beeen out-witted by the wise men, flew into a rage.

Sba20820a-Aec143841	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"I will defend myself in chronological order of the defences given by pro The important fact of the subconscious that you, as I will refer directly to Los_Altos_JW, seem to ignore one I came outright with saying that the subconscious is apart of our self. You claim that we have no direct control over it, yet still concede that it is apart of our ""self"". I find this to be contradictory. While we may not feel that we have no control over the subconscious, the subconscious is still apart of us, and thus we do have control over it, though we may not be aware of it. No more aware are we of the actions of our subconscious than we are of the acids being released in our stomach, or the complex circulation of blood from our hearts through the vanes and back again. We, in terms of our whole body, are still going through these processes, and while our active minds may not have a direct hold over them, they still work. Everything inside us is us, and can not be negated of being apart of us. To the second point: Yes, going to the bathroom is an action caused by a previous one, but was still not caused by the succession of events that followed the drinking of water. Should our fates be determined, every action would need to be effected by every preceding event. This argument did have its flaws, I will admit, and I will not precede with this case unless further argument is called upon it. As to my second example: I do not feel a strong argument was made on this point. I did not say that there where any pre-causes following up to this stop of nourishment, only that they simply stopped. If an scenario is needed: A man is hungry, but simply did not eat. There where no outside influences, nor previous thought processes, he simply did not eat, and had no thoughts about it even up till death. While highly improbable, this is a perfectly possible scenario. In this case, what past event influenced him, also assuming he had no brain disorders or illnesses? On the final argument: I do not misunderstand this point. I will work on your example ""I will murder someone on Dec 16. 2007"". At the time the statement is uttered, there is neither a true nor false, as the event has not occurred. As the event has not occurred, there is still the time period of ""possibility"". Anything can happen within this period, literally, anything. You could end up killing the person, whether intentional or not, and very easily you could not. BUT, until the event has happened there is still the shadow of a doubt, and that is all that's needed. Once it is Dec 17, 2007, then the event can properly be marked ""true or false"". To summaries: the statement itself does not necessitate the accuracy of it. The nature of truth cannot be determined until the action has passed, therefore verifying it to be true, all other prediction, whether proving true or not, are by default false until having actually happened. One my note: I do not say we cannot know the past, but that we can never prove the existence of one. However, I have shown empirical and logical proof that determinism is flawed, via the natural world. Should this discussion reach to religious territory, it would make all previous arguments null and void. My first and second rebuttal proves that the actions controlled by the chemicals in our brains are still apart of us, therefore, we are still making the choice, whether aware of it or not. The causality argument is still not 100% settled either way in my opinion, though I'm sure you, Los_Altos_JW, think otherwise. Mankind can never know the future as there is no way to prove there is one, only the actions and consequences of the past. WHile past events may have a hold over certain aspects of the here and now, and the events that are yet to come, not all are. We must all remember, that while it is still uncertain how, there was a beginning, and nothing preceded it to work off of."	CON	74

S88b62b30-Aa1491840	The Bible is free of contradiction	"My opponent concedes to the inaccuracy of her First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and Twelfth claims. Supposed Contradiction #4, which is the first instance of God changing His mind, shall now be Supposed Contradiction #1. I shall now answer my opponent's Supposed Contradictions numerically, numbering 1-8 1. Does God Change His Mind? I don't exactly understand my opponent's problem with this. God did not change His mind about the goodness of man, for He made man and man sinned against Him. Does God regret in this situation where before He did not? Of course...but if we are to think that this qualifies as change then any sort of difference in attitude is a change as well. When God is disappointed with us, does He change simply because He was not disappointed before? Does God change when He pours out wrath because he did not pour it out before? It seems to me that if we are to accept this kind of action as a changing of one's mind, then the verses provided by Con to say that God does not change are being misused. Obviously the writers were not talking about how God does not change in his emotion, rather that what He says does not change. His actions do not, his words do not, etc. 2. Jesus and Testifying. This was, again, quite satisfying. I read through the passage of John 8, and I found why Jesus is saying that His testimony is true. Here is the passage: Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” 13 Then the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.” 14 Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. 15 You judge by human standards; I judge no one. 16 Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me. 17 In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.18 I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.” Jesus is saying that He is not testifying alone, for The Father is also testifying on his behalf. This is why he says such about His own testimony. Now, what about when Jesus speaks about his testimony being invalid? Well, when we read the full text, we see the full picture. I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me 31 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 32 There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony to me is true. 33 You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth. 34 Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that you may be saved. 35 He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. 36 But I have a testimony greater than John’s. The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. 37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. See? There is no testimony where Jesus speaks for Himself, He is showing us that even if He testifies by Himself, The Father also testifies with Him. Therefore one is two. I and The Father are one. -John 10:30 There is no contradiction. 3. Language in Ancient Times I personally believe that Noah could have found other human beings, but we are simply ignorant of the events that transpired afterwards. I obviously do not believe in a global flood interpretation, so there could have been other civilizations. We simply do not know what happened, Moses does not write of it. So no, there is no reason to concede on the basis of dramazitation. 4. The Ten Plagues The Exodus Decoded has been criticized heavily by scholars, and I had remembered that I had actually watched it sometime in the past. Due to the overwhelming criticisms of the film in general, I do request a more established work with better footing in the scholarly world. (See source ""1"" for the various critiques of the film) 5. Sins of The Father I really do not see the contradiction here. Ezekiel is saying that one who sins shall die, and Moses is saying that if a son follows in the footsteps of his wicked father that he too will suffer consequence. The entire text of Exodus 20:5 is as follows: ""visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me."" The text is showing that the sins of the father are being passed down to those who hate God as their fathers did. Now look at the verse before Ezekiel 18:20: 19 Yet you say, “Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?” When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live. The text is showing that the sins of the father shall not be suffered by the son if the son is righteous. 6. Jacob or Israel? First off, it should be noted that much like the Proverbs contradiction, if my opponent is right then Genesis 46:1 contradicts Genesis 46:2. Genesis 46:1: When Israel set out on his journey with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. The answer to this is that the name Israel is used in a spiritual sense, this was the name given to God as a spiritual ""title"". He was still called Jacob as a person, but Israel was used to signify the spirituality or importance of Jacob. So, for instance, in Genesis 48:16 we read the following: the Angel who has delivered me from all harm --may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth. Lest we take this too literally, we can see that Jacob is giving his title of ""Israel"" unto the sons of Joseph. This was not his new name in the sense of Saul to Paul, but rather a title given to him. 7. Eighth Commandment I was a bit skeptical of the verses that Con provided, they seemed to leave out quite a bit. My doubts were confirmed. Here is the full text of Exodus 3:20-22 1 ""I will bring this people into such favor with the Egyptians that, when you go, you will not go empty-handed; 22 each woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman living in the neighbor’s house for jewellery of silver and of gold, and clothing, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters; and so you shall plunder the Egyptians.” Unless my opponent would wish to defend the position that asking a neighbor for something is theft, then I don't see this as any sort of contradiction. 8. Dead Zed I really don't understand why this is contradictory. He did not die by the sword, and he died in custody. His own sons were slaughtered, and he was not. I'd say that dying of natural causes is very peaceful. These were, once again, great attempts at finding a contradiction. The same guidelines apply to round 3. Rebut any contradiction you would like, and give as many more as you would like, but please keep it within reason. Sources: 1. http://en.wikipedia.org..."	PRO	76
S82aa19d7-Ac52ac299	Men Should Have No Say Womens' Abortion Decision	"Thank you to Con for his response. When I talk of 'power imbalance' in sexual relationships, I'm not talking about rape or ""coercion"" particularly. I'm talking about ordinary, everyday sexual politics. For example, in a 2006 survey of Canadian women [1]: ""Of these 2751 women [who had sex but didn't want to get pregnant], 410 (14.9%) never used contraception. Among contraception users, the most frequently used methods of contraception were condoms (54.3%), OCs (43.7%), and withdrawal (11.6%). Newer contraceptive methods were used by less than 4%. Choice of contraceptive method varied by age. Only 65.2% of respondents who were sexually active and not trying to conceive “always used” contraception."" (my emphasis) How can it be, in this day and age, that women are still allowing these situations? How can they still be so much on the back foot? And, to my mind, the high incidence of abortion is a symptom of women's lack of power in ordinary, everyday sexual relations. Con thinks that ""[t]he real solution is to raise boys to be better men and treat women with respect..."" My own view is that women need to take control more. It's OK for us to disagree on the best means to improve the situation because it's not central to the debate. Con gives the example of Fat Fred and the wallet which, I'm afraid, I find confusing. Is Fat Fred the woman, the wallet the foetus? Or is it the other way around? But the overall principle is sound. We don't have absolute right over our bodies. We have only the rights that society/government gives us. And societies differ in terms of what rights are granted. That's the whole point of this debate, I suppose. My argument is that women should be able to decide whether they want to donate their own biological resources to another person (foetus) or if they want to keep those resources for themselves. Con is arguing that they should be forced to donate those resources against their will. This has been preamble. I will now address Con's arguments directly. P1. Foetal rights Con argued that abortion in theory is separation of mother and foetus, but that the procedures are often direct killing methods. This is quite true. And if Con insists, we could legislate against these direct killing methods and allow only ""pure"" separation methods. But why? Is it more humane to have a foetus come out live and die in a kidney dish? To my mind, there's not much difference. Presumably, the doctors go for the quickest, safest, cheapest method. Abortion is ""withholding support"" and it's also ""killing"". Which term you use depends on what you want to say. In terms of foetal rights, it's withholding support. Because we do not allow any person the right to take biological resources from another against her will. Women have the right to terminate pregnancies. Is it moral for them to do so? These are two quite separate issues. It's not uncommon for women to use abortion quite casually, as a form of contraception. I can understand Con's distaste for this. I don't like it much myself. But what should we do about it? Con would like to intervene. He would like to impose his own morality on women, and force them to continue the pregnancies against their will. I find this sort of position difficult to understand. You can't end evil in the world by forcing others to comply with your own view of right and wrong. Goodness. Hasn't history shown us this over and over? P.2 Killing humans is [prima facie] immoral No, no, of course I meant ""privacy"" in quite a different way. I didn't mean it as the opposite of ""public"". That would make no sense at all. What I meant was that as a society we allow individuals freedom and control over certain moral decisions. For example. I think that bystanders should help at an accident, if they can. I think that nobody should lie to their mothers. I think people should be faithful to their partners. That everyone should make sure to pay for their fair share of drinks. That nobody should mention sociobiology at parties. But should there be legislation to force people to do these things? Of course not. Apart from the difficulty, the impossibility, of enforcing such legislation, people should be allowed to make their own choices. Of course we disagree with a lot of what they do. That’s diversity for you. And so, yes, Con thinks that abortion is immoral. Whether he is right or wrong to think so is not the issue here. The issue is: is it OK for him to take his view of morality and impose it on women in the form of some kind of restriction on their actions (legislative restriction, I’m assuming)? No, it isn’t. P.3 Anyone can take a stand against immorality Con said: ""If Pro can say that murder is wrong, then he could admit that if abortion were murder, it would also be objectively wrong."" This is a circular argument. Murder is, by definition, wrongful killing. Therefore, if abortion were murder, it would be unnecessary to add that it's wrong. But it's not murder. Con said ""And by ""stand against,"" I merely mean ""work toward the ending of the practice."""" That's hardly more clear. This how things are: 1. There are pregnant women who want to terminate. 2. There are doctors willing to do the termination. 3. Con wants to end the practice. THEREFORE: some degree of force is required to prevent the termination. Possibly, Con desires legislation against abortion which would get him the full force of the police and the legal system to help him force women to continue their pregnancies. When I said ""morality is subjective"", I wasn't trying to plunge into a defense of moral (or cultural) relativism! Far from it. As Charlesworth and Chinkin say: ""While concerns of cultural relativism arise with respect to human rights generally, it is striking that 'culture' is much more frequently invoked in the context of women's rights than any other area."" [2] And, yes, we've seen that conflict over and over again, with abortion rights, social justice, gendered poverty, female circumcision, trafficking, child marriages and female infanticide. So no, I am not arguing for moral relativism. Quite the opposite. With my ""morality is subjective"" comment, I was trying to point out that Con's view of morality is his own and should not be imposed onto millions of women. Nevertheless, I take note of Con's use of the term ""civilized"" as in ""civilized countries"". Civilized countries, he says, hold to the same moral standard. Presumably, countries that have a different standard are ""uncivilized"". Another circular argument. Con mentioned slavery and violence against women as things that are wrong even if legal. Of course. The big difference, of course, is that these are violences imposed on individuals that should be removed. And now Con is arguing for another violence to be imposed on women. He wants foetuses to grow into babies and children, and he is happy to put aside women's rights over their own bodies to achieve his aim. Of course he shouldn't ""work towards ending the practice"" of women having sovereignty over their own bodies. C. Therefore men can take a stand against abortion Men have often been successful preventing abortion. In fact, Roe vs Wade only existed because men had been so successful stopping abortion. If men's influence over abortion decisions were removed entirely (including past influence, which is silly, and also not part of this debate, but whatever), then women would be free to have abortions. Which is how it should be. Con is free to dislike abortion. He is free to talk prolifically about it and against it. However, his will should not be imposed on women. Nobody's will should be. If we don't want to give our bodies and our biological resources to support foetal life, then we have every right to refuse to. And nobody should force us otherwise.

S5990b6b8-A3a16ac71	All humans ought to assume that the Christian God does not exist, based on lack of evidence.	"For easy reading and typing, I will refer to PRO as ""he"" in the instances that ""he or she"" would generally be accepted. ""All humans ought to assume that the Christian God does not exist, based on lack of evidence."" This is the claim that my opponent has asserted. I will attempt to prove this statement false throughout this debate. I would like to start with this point: the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim. [1] In most debates on the subject of religion, it is the one advocating the religion who usually takes on the burden of proof since he is usually the one making the claim. However, in this debate, the shoe is on the other foot; it is up to PRO to prove his statement to be true. My job in this debate is not to prove that the Christian God exists or even to prove that any omnipotent being exists. It is simply to provide enough evidence to show that it is not the case that all humans ought to assume that the Christian God does not exist based on lack of evidence. To make the claim that PRO makes is to say that anyone who believes the Christian God exists is committing a logical fallacy. He asserts that if one does not have sufficient evidence, one should not believe that something is true. With this in mind, let""s look at the most common reason Christians put forth to support their idea that there is a God. Christians choose to believe that the complexity of our universe and of life itself cannot be random, that it must be caused by a deliberate action of an omnipotent being. [2] This is often presented as an analogy, comparing the universe to a watch and God to a watchmaker. This analogy claims that just as a complex watch cannot just fall into existence, neither can the universe; there must be a creator. Many scientists, as PRO points out, would point to the Big Bang Theory as the reason for the existence of all things. The idea of the Big Bang Theory cannot be taken as fact, however, because there is no way to prove that it is true. [3] Both the Christian explanation and the CURRENT scientific explanation are plausible, while neither can be proven true or false. Both ideas must be taken on faith. Is there sufficient evidence to believe that there is a God based on the information above? That would be relative to the person reading it, just as the Big Bang Theory may or may not provide sufficient evidence that there is not a need for a god. It is not fair to say that there is a lack of evidence for Christianity when the only evidence the opponent provides is the faith of a different community of people. I believe I have given enough reason to believe that PRO""s assertion is not necessarily a true one, leaving him with the task of proving otherwise. To clarify my point, I assert that extensive evidence and proof are not requirements to believe that something is true. The only requirements that would justify (not prove) someone""s belief are that the belief is possible and that there is no evidence to disprove the belief. ""BASED ON THE LIMITED OBSERVATIONS OF HUMANS, FACTS WHICH DO NOT CONTRADICT OTHER FACTS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS VALID, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER OPTIONS, BECAUSE ALL THAT HUMANS CLAIM TO BE KNOWLEDGE IS BASED ON LIMITED OBSERVATION. Christianity contradicts every other religion, thus Christianity cannot yet be accepted as valid. The burden of proof rests on Christians in this case."" The Big Bang Theory, while widely accepted, has not been proven to be fact and contradicts the teachings of several religions; therefore, based on the above statement made by PRO, the Big Bang Theory cannot be accepted as valid. As I said before, in a normal debate about religion, the burden of proof is on the side of the religious; however, in this instance, it is not correct to claim that Christianity is false simply due to a lack of evidence. Doing so would, in turn, force one to assume that every claim made about the beginning of our universe to be invalid as none of them have been proven fact, and most of them contradict the others.

Sb33195c5-A201ee18a	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"You make good points. Here are my arguments. God condones slavery. Genesis 17:12 states ""And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised."" Exodus 12:43 states ""The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, ""These are the regulations for the Passover: No foreigner is to eat of it. Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him, but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it."" Exodus 21:1 states ""Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them. When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,' then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for life."" We today view slavery as morally unacceptable and it is illegal in most countries. Why, then, do we praise and worship a deity that deems it as morally acceptable? If God were to exist, wouldn't you expect there to be a benefit to those who follow and obey him? Why, instead, do we see the opposite? Christians are persecuted by some for believing in God, as are Jews. Muslims are also persecuted by some for their beliefs. If you look at the history of these religions, you will not find ease and prosperity for them, as God has supposedly promised. The Jews were enslaved in Egypt, murdered in the Polish death camps, and yet through all this they looked to God. God offered them no help through those trying times, and for that, His people suffered. The promise of heaven for believing can't be guaranteed. This ""benefit"" is worthless should the people be killed or tortured and not able to reach heaven."	PRO	80
S11be5eba-A6f431e45	Robots sent to destroy human life on Earth would be more moral than humans are capable of being.	I thank my opponent for his last round, and will now offer my final counterpoints. Pro has not given much to respond to, but I will answer as best I can. The two sections seem to have merged somewhat, so I won't be splitting them up. On AP2 & Overcoming the is - ought gap Let me note that Pro has not responded to the point that crossing the is - ought gap is irrelevant - what matters is whether the humans can conform to a standard of right conduct, which Pro has tacitly conceded by not responding to. This point simply wins me the debate, because it shows humans are *capable* of being more moral than robots, even if I cannot show that they *ought* to. Which that in mind, let's look at what Pro did respond to. My point has been that Pro has inconsistently applied Hume's is - ought gap to humans and not the robots. If Pro cannot show that there is a disparity between the two cases that results in robots crossing the gap but humans not, then Pro has succeeded. Has he? Not even slightly; in fact, Pro's attempt to overcome it is laughable, boiling down to bare assertion. He argues that whereas the hypothetical imperative crosses the is - ought gap in the case of robots, it does not in the case of humans. Why does it succeed in the case of robots? He says the creators 'gave' the robots a hypothetical imperative. This is the misunderstand the nature of a hypothetical imperative: but let's first note the issue of whether the people who 'gave' the robots their hypothetical imperative were themselves beings with subjective preferences; I can't think of how they could be anything else, so again Pro falls into his own trap - by his own argument, the standards the robots conform to are subjective. But does crossing the is - ought gap using a hypothetical imperative render the actual standards of right conduct subjective? No, because the question of why you ought to conform to a standard has no bearing on what the standard actually is. Claiming that the way you come to conform to a standard changes the standard itself is as fallacious as claiming that the path you take to the local grocery store changes the local grocery store. It's a complete non - sequitur. Finally, the printer and the robots. Pro claims out of the blue that the robots are sentient - well firstly, whether or not robots even can be sentient is a contentious issue - see The Chinese Room [1] thought experiment. Secondly, Pro has just invented this now - nothing previously entailed that his robots were sentient, and it's usually against the rules of conduct to bring up new arguments in the final round. Besides, he still doesn't address the broader point, that it's absurd to claim that programming endows the thing being programmed with an objective moral standard. To sum: 1. Pro did not show that crossing the is - ought gap is necessary. Even if I can't show that people ought to conform to rules of right standards, this does not entail that they are not capable of doing so. Pro dropped this point. 2. Pro has not shown that robots are capable of crossing the is - ought gap, or that humans can't while robots can. 3. Pro has not addressed the point that programming clearly does not entail objective moral obligations.	CON	81

Sb33195c5-A97c7e96d	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"Yes. God has accepted slavery. But what kind of slavery? I have no idea how slavery is in Christianity. But I tell you about the rights of slaves in Islam. I'll post a comment for your second argument. 1. The sense of brotherhood Islam has created a notion that both master and slave were brothers, one to the other, by inculcating an awareness that all men were created by the same God and were the children of the same parents,""O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" (Quran 49:13) God has cut apart the very root of all forms of narrow mindedness that arose out of the feelings of superior birth. The prophet had taught that righteousness wasn't measured on the basis of color, race or wealth, but on the basis of God-fearing alone. ""The Arab has no superiority over the non-Arab or the non-Arab over the Arab; the white over the black or the black over the white except in the matter of God-fearing."" Where slaves are mentioned, God remarked that ""You are of one another."" (4:25) He makes it clear that both master and slave are brothers and that it is circumstances alone which force slavery upon some people. 2. An awareness concerning the rights of the slave The slave was a mere commodity item in all ancient societies. His lot was confined to duties alone. His obligation was simply to strive for an increase in the comforts and luxury enjoyed by the master and in this regard, there was to be no compromise whatsoever. It was a paramount necessity that the slave was in good shape in order to be able to work for his master. The slaves were housed in yards which sufficed to accommodate not even the cattle and other livestock. As for the clothes that they were provided with, they were sufficient not even to cover their nakedness. Islam brought about a transformation in the situation. It taught that slave had rights as well. The prophet said:""They are your brothers and relatives. Let each one provide for the brother under him with the food that he himself eats and with the clothes that he himself wears. Place not upon them any task that is overbearing for them. If you do assign them a difficult task, you must help them in its execution."" The duty of the slave, in primitive societies, was never confined to mere labour. He was also doomed to be at the receiving end of his master""s sadistic pleasure-seekings. To be always ready to kill and to be killed for the sake of his master""s pleasure. God ordered that such a state of affairs must change. It instructed in the humane and proper treatment of the slaves."" Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good,""and to relatives, orphans, the needy, ..., the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful."" (4:36) The prophet said:""If anyone kills a slave, we shall kill him. If anyone maims a slave, we shall maim him as well. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him."" From being the choice commodity for the master""s choicest desire, the slave was being transformed into a being with his very own personality and rights. It was in a society in which existed the heinous practice of castrating slaves that the prophet had, in the most unambiguous terms, declared that the master who castrates his slave will, in turn, ""be castrated by us."" The slaves were castrated in order that their sexual impulses be destroyed, whereby, they could then be made to work like animals. Islam, which prohibited this practice, particularly instructs that means should be made available for the satisfaction of the sexual instincts of the slave also. ""Marry those among you who are single, and the virtuous ones among your slaves, male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah is Ample-giving, and He knows all things."" (24:32) God also prohibited the system of forcing female slaves into prostitution. ""But let them who find not the means for marriage abstain from sexual relations until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract for eventual emancipation from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek thereby the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is to them, after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.""(24:33) The Prophet taught against even uttering anything that might injure the self-respect of the slave. The prophet had made it clear that the slave, too, enjoyed self-respect upon which none had the right to trespass. Islam teaches that the slave has the right to become even a leader and that in the event that he does get appointed as a leader, it is obligatory to obey him. ""Even if it be a negro slave, with hair like dried grapes, who is appointed as your leader, you must hear and obey him."" ""Seat him behind thee for he is thy brother and it is the same soul as yours that is within him."" Islam gave new meaning to the relation between master and slave by insisting that the master and the slave both had the same soul. It is true, nevertheless, that the slave does fall under the jurisdiction of the master. However, the master is duty-bound to fulfill the rights of the slave. It is his duty to meet the slave""s requirements of food, clothing, sexual gratification and so on. The slave is never to be harmed. He shouldn't be put into difficulty by entrusting him with burdensome tasks as well. In such fashion did Islam create a revolution of sorts in raising the slave, for the first time in history, to the position of a free man. It was through this way that it became possible for Islam to bridge the wide gap that existed between the mental states of the master and the slave. The end result of this revolution was that the owner was emancipated from the belief that the slave was a commodity on which could be carried out his choicest desire while the slave was freed of the notion that he was doomed to a fate in which he was to bear, and to be patient and labouring always. 3. Declared the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness. By declaring the slave""s to be an existence which had rights of its own, Islam had made slavery non-existent. Without stopping at that point, however, it went further by turning to a course of action which would, in time, serve to eliminate the system in a very practical sense indeed. This practical step which Islam had adopted to make slavery virtually non-existent was its act of declaring the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness. God said:""Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered"" prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So they who have believed in him,honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful."" (7:157) This verse which makes it clear that the emancipation of slaves is an act of the highest virtue goes as follows:"" What can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass? It is the freeing of a slave or feeding on a day of severe hunger. An orphan of near relationship or a needy person in misery."" (90:12-16) As far as the emancipation of slaves was concerned, the prophet had exhorted his companions towards it by making an example himself. He set free the slaves who were in his possession. There are numerous sayings of the prophet which encourage the freeing of slaves. ""If anyone sets free a believing slave, each of his body parts will be set free from Hell so much so that it will be the hand for a hand, the leg for a right up to the sexual organ for the sexual organ."" Once, the Prophet was asked:""Which is the highest act in the emancipation of slaves?"" he replied, ""To set free the most valuable slave of the master."" He, while talking about those who become deserving of God""s reward twice, said, ""He who confers a proper behavior upon the female slave under him, then gives her the best education, sets her free and then marries her will become entitled to a double reward."" 4. Emancipation of slaves was made the act of expiation for many types of sin In addition to encouraging the believers towards its commission by declaring the emancipation of slaves to be a virtuous deed, Islam recommended it as an act of expiation for many types of sin. The atonement for sins like unintentional murder and breaking one""s vow of not approaching his wife was the freeing of one slave. As for those who were not ready to free slaves in expectation of God's reward alone, the command which made the emancipation of slaves an atoning act for sins committed, nevertheless, made it necessary for them to do so."

S82aa19d7-A6e42e341	Men Should Have No Say Womens' Abortion Decision	"Thank you to Pro for continuing the discussion. I will reply briefly to Pro's comments. I am aware of the awful nature of abortion (though some pro-choice advocates argue that there is nothing bad about abortion). Germaine Greer is simply mistaken about the nature of relationships. Certainly some relations are of a coercive nature, but not all (or even most) of them. Additionally, even if a woman is ""coerced"" into having relations (which is a very dubious statement), she still bears moral culpability for the child she was instrumental in conceiving. The real solution is to raise boys to be better men and treat women with respect, not to kill a living human being that she conceives. My statement that women should be prevented from having abortions is not a horrible statement (and indeed, Pro has decided to attack a strawman). Women have control over their bodies, but no one has absolute right over their bodies. Pro-choice philosopher Louis Pojman provides an example: ""Consider 500-pound Fat Fred who decides to sit down, but your money-packed wallet happens to be directly on the spot where he sits. You request him to move his body so that you can get your wallet, but he refuses, claiming that he has an absolute right to do with his body what he wills."" [1] No one has an absolute right to bodily integrity, and if the unborn are valuable human beings (as we are), then prevented an abortion is not attempting to control womens' bodies, it is preventing abortionists and women from murdering the most vulnerable members of our species. I will now respond to Pro's criticisms of my argument. P1 -- The unborn, from fertilization, are human beings. Pro mentions that from the sixth month (it's actually a couple of weeks before the sixth month) the unborn are not able to live independently. But he doesn't support his contention as to why this is a morally relevant reason to allow us to kill them. Until he supports this contention, it should be regarded as a baseless assertion, nothing more. The unborn is the same entity from fertilization past viability past birth, so there is no reason to grant the unborn rights at viability and not before. Abortion, medically, is merely the separation of the unborn from the woman. However, medical methods to perform this procedure are not mere separations, it is direct killing -- through dismemberment, poisoning, etc. As Frank Beckwith writes, ""euphemistically calling abortion the withholding of support makes about as much sense as calling suffocating someone with a pillow the withdrawing of oxygen."" [2] P2 -- Killing human beings is [prima facie] immoral. Point taken in regards to certain types of killing. I have amended my statement to read that killing humans is prima facie immoral. It is not always wrong to kill, especially in self-defense. While there is some privacy involved in moral decisions, if abortion kills an innocent human being then it can't be justified in the name of privacy, any more than child abuse or spousal abuse could be justified by claiming that it was done in the privacy of their own home/bedroom. P3 -- Anyone can stand against immorality (this is not limited to a particular gender, race, etc.). Immorality is not subjective. When I say abortion is wrong, I am not saying ""I dislike abortion"" like I dislike guacamole. I am saying that it is wrong for all people, at all times (this would include men, if they had the capacity to become pregnant). If Pro can say that murder is wrong (as he seemed to have conceded in his critique of my second premise), then he could admit that if abortion were murder, it would also be objectively wrong. And by ""stand against,"" I merely mean ""work toward the ending of the practice."" I do not condone abortion-related violence from the pro-choice or the pro-life side. Slavery was once legal in the United States. It is now illegal. If morality were merely subjective, then slavery was a moral practice, and the abolitionists who opposed it were moral monsters, not heroes. I am sure Pro would also concede that slavery was immoral, even when it was legal (at least, I hope he would). As such, all human beings are deserving of dignity. What is legal is not always moral, and what is moral is not always legal. It is not right to mistreat women, even if it is legal to do so. In the example from Bangladesh, I would say that no, it would be wrong for them to whack any ""offending women."" I would hope Pro would agree. I would also hope Pro would agree it would be wrong of them to do so, even if it is legal for them to do so. But moral relativism would dictate that it is moral for some men to abuse women. Civilized countries hold to the same moral standard, e.g. that murder is wrong and is illegal. They may disagree on what constitutes murder, but they still hold ""murder is wrong"" to be an objective moral standard. The pro-life position makes a case that abortion is immoral and should be illegal (since murder is illegal). If this is true, then pro-life advocates are well within their rights to oppose it. C -- Therefore, men can take a stand agaisnt abortion (including making it illegal, etc.). No, it was not a joke. If men must stay out of the abortion issue, we would have to overturn all the legislation on abortion that was voted on by men. Pro can't have it both ways. If men must stay out of the abortion issue, they must stay out on both sides. The sword cuts both ways. We must give abortion legislation back to the states, and then have only women decide on legislation about whether or not abortion should be legal. Pro states, ""...if we were to overturn all decisions made by men, we would have to include the decisions that made abortion illegal in the first place, all the rulings of the Catholic Church, and indeed most of Chrsitianity, which has been very male dominated."" Pro misrepresents my position. Only abortion-related decisions that were made by men would have to be overturned. Nothing in my reductio would indicate that every decision by males would have to be overturned. Besides, this is what Pro's position entails, not mine. My position entails that if something is immoral, especially so immoral that it should be illegal (such as murder, rape, and abortion, if it fits), then men have as much say in restricting it as women do. I have sufficiently upheld my argument. Pro has failed to give any compelling reason as to why the abortion decision should remain the woman's considering it, and hers alone. [1] Louis P.

Sba20820a-A3a5eab72	Determinism: Free will is an illusion	"To start off, I will discuss the flaw of the ""subconscious"" argument. When we think of who we are, we usually consider ourselves, emphasis on ""self"", as the body we see in the mirror, and the actions that can be observed from others our ourselves. This is not the case. While, yes, our bodies are apart of ""ourselves"", but in reality, most body structures are rudimentary the same, it is the brain that is our true ""self"", as it controls the thoughts and actions of the machine that is our body. An analogy: our bodies are like cars, and the brain is the operator. Without the brain, the body is useless matter. I explain all this to emphasize an important point: As the brain is our true self, the actions of the subconscious are also our actions, even though our active minds are not directly aware of the action itself. My sources are many years of education, and a father who is a scientist on the actions of the brain. Secondly, on the note of ""every action is determined by a previous action"". This is not an entirely true statement. MOST actions are a result of a previous action. Examples: taking a step with your left foot because you took a step from your right, stopping at a light, digesting your food because you ate it. However, not all actions MUST be determined by a previous action. They can be completely random and uncalled for. For instance, should you murder someone, there seems to be only two reasonable responses: run or stay and get caught. Both of these options would be a direct result of the murder, however, there are possibilities that one could take that have no direct relation to the crime, such as going to the bathroom, or making a sandwich. One could also choose to simply do nothing with no mindset whatsoever. Any of these options would not ave been preceded by the case. Another simple example would be hunger and thirst. When one is hungry, the usual following action is to eat. When one is thirsty, one usually drinks. However, one may choose to ignore both of the possibilities and starve, thus causing death. The Choice to drink would be a result of thirst, yet the refusal is a result of will, and death because of that. The two options are not one in the same, but completely different. In order for something to be determined by your argument, every action would need to be a direct action of the one preceding it, which is not the case. This thus means choices, and ergo, will. To your true or false argument. This is an untrue argument. nothing can be either true or false until it has happened, not before. A weatherman can predict the weather, and he'll either be right or wrong, true. However, there is still the time in between the prediction where anything can happen. A wind change, a temperature drop. While he made the prediction, the events that are happening at the moment are what make that prediction come into place , not the prediction in itself. Had he said nothing, what ever happened would still happen whether pointed out or not. Had it not been by anyone in the world, it would make the weather result neither true nor false, as there would be no contradictory. I believe the only matter of fact way that man kind can finish this argument once and for all is via time travel, as childish as that sounds. Should it be possible to move from the past to the present or present to future, this would show that a string of events is already laid out like a road that can be traveled to any destination on it. Otherwise, life is like a succession of snapshots moving rapidly, like a film. Analogy: imagine watching a film with no remote, but continues to go. There is no rewind or fast forward. The only manner to recall what has happened previously is what you remember, and all you can see of the future is your own predictions, though anything can happen. This is how real life is now. There is evidence of a past, and that events occurred in it, however, there is no physical past. Everything that happens is in the here and now. You enter it and then its gone faster than you can even realize."	CON	86
Sb33195c5-A4dfeebca	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"When you go to school, you will see a principle who manages it. When you go to an office, you will see a boss who work there and orders the employee to do stuff. When you enter a garden, you will find a gardener who waters the plants and cares for them. So, is the existence of God something strange? Do you think this universe doesn't need a manager? Do you think a small school is greater than the universe? Only an ignorant person thinks so. God is the Lord of this Universe. He is its manager. He organizes it: ""And a sign for them is the night. We remove from it [the light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness. And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point."" That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.And the moon - We have determined for it phases, until it returns [appearing] like the old date stalk. It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming. 36:37-40"" He tells the sky when to rain. He orders the river to flow. He orders the ants where to go: ""It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers. 14:32"" Why do you deny God? Because you can't define Him? Because you can't describe Him? Because you can't imagine He is omnipotent? Because you are not wise enough to know Him? Oh come on. When you don't believe that an omnipotent being exists, it's your own problem. You can't describe God. You cannot know Him completely. Because your knowledge and intellect are limited. Can you define spirit? Have you ever seen it? Can you describe how spirit is? No. Because we don't have much information about spirit. We just know it exists. So, we don't have enough information about God. We just need to believe He exists. Once, the polytheists of Mecca came to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and said to him:"" Tell us about your God and His attributes. What is He like?"". Then God revealed this Noble Chapter of Quran: ""Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent."" (112:1-4) God has introduced Himself in this way. He didn't told us anything else. Because we cannot understand. You said about starving people. But first of all, I should tell you something. Do not quote or read the Bible. It has been CHANGED. It is CORRUPTED. You should read Quran. It is the only True Divin Book. Anyway, how should God feed the starving children? Do you like He orders food to pour down like raid?!! God helps those children through us. He asks us to feed them. He asks us to give money to charity and help the poor: ""And when it is said to them, 'Spend from that which Allah has provided for you,' those who disbelieve say to those who believe, 'Should we feed one whom, if Allah had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error."" (Quran 36:47) ""And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register. 11:6"" ""Never will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of Allah] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it. 3:92"" God wants us to feed those children. And if they are suffering from starvation, it is our fault. You said that God knew who will go to hell and heaven. Let's suppose it is true. And also, let's suppose you will go to hell. Do you like God punishes you immediately after your creation? For example, imagine you are born today and God takes you to hell. You asks:"" O God! Why am I burning here? I didn't make any mistake. I didn't commit any sin."". And God says:"" You didn't. But I know you will sin in the future. So I am punishing you in advance."" Does it make sense to you? Does it seem fair? Do you want God punishes you before you do something wrong? I want to ask you a question. Do you know where you had been before your birth? Most people believe that there are only two worlds; this world and the hereafter. But they are wrong. There are four worlds: (The names are in Arabic) 1. Zarr; the world before birth. When God creates us, we live there until our birth. 2. Dunya; the world where we are living in. 3. Barzakh; the world after death. When we die, we will go there and live til the day of Judgement 4. Akhirah (the hereafter); the eternal world where we will go after the Day of Judgement Ok, I want to tell you a little about Zarr: Before we were born, we had lived in Zarr. In that world, God asked us many questions. For example, He asked us how we liked to live. He asked us how we liked to die. We have answered all those questions. And we are living in this world according to our answers. We had also taken some exams. Those people who passed the testp in Zarr, became the Messengers and Prophets of God in this world. The people who got good marks, became the good people in this world. And the rest became the evil ones and disbelievers. We don't know exactly what happened in Zarr. Because we have forgotten it when we were born. God knows who will go to heaven and hell because of the tests which we took in Zarr. On the Day of Judgement, God says to the people of the hell:"" [Then He will say], 'But stand apart today, you criminals, Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy - And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.'"" (Quran 36:59) Do you know when God enjoined that? Do you remember? No. Because God has did it in Zarr, but we have forgotten that: ""And it will be said,""Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours, and your refuge is the Fire, and for you there are no helpers. 45:34"" Ok, I don't say anything else about Zarr. Because you may get confused. You said:""Nothing can exist unless it is created."". It is true. But let's imagine someone has created God. So the creator of God needs another creator. And also, His creator needs another one and so on. And as a result, we have a limitless chain of Gods who have created one another!!! Does it make sense to you?!!!! No-one has created God, because he doesn't need anything. But what about us? We need water to quench our thirst. We need food to satisfy our hunger and etc. We also need someone who gives us what we need and He is God: ""And We have sent the fertilizing winds and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it. And you are not its retainers. 15:22"" ""And have you seen the water that you drink? Is it you who brought it down from the clouds, or is it We who bring it down? If We willed, We could make it bitter, so why are you not grateful? 56:68-70"" ""Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners? And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat. And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful? 36:71-73"" We need a Creator, because we can't live without His help. We can do nothing if He doesn't help us. ""So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, ""My Lord indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.' 24:28"" But God doesn't need a Creator. because He needs nothing. I swear that I will never worship a god who is in need of something. ""They have said,' Allah has taken a son."" Exalted is He; He is the [one] Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority for this [claim]. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know? 10:68"" ""And Moses said, 'If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.'"

It states that ""The toxins are highly labile in purified form, maintaining activity for only 2−5 days before all activity is lost."" According to the Oxford dictionary, labile means ""apt or likely to change;"" or ""unstable; rapidly cleaved (and possibly reformed)."" ""Possibly reformed"" implies that the algae could have replicated (reproduced?) and undergone the same toxicating process. So it could have lasted a week. The study in source #4 was one in which the algae was isolated in order to be studied. Therefore, the environment was controlled to an extent, whereas it could not have been during the time the plagues occured. ----- [Exodus 3:22] - ""So you will plunder the Egyptians."" Also, one of the several definitions of the word ""favor"" (according to the Oxford dictionary): ""Mildness or mitigation of punishment; lenity.""

S88b62b30-A43ddff0e	The Bible is free of contradiction	"Thank you for the response. Again, you make good points. I will try to be more precise in my meaning pertaining to God's change of mind. For clarity: change one's mind: to change one's opinions or intentions. God saw that mankind was good, but in [Gensis 6] God saw that evil had spread wide across the earth, and He regretted having created man. His opinion changed in that He believed man to be good until Adam and Eve's fall, and thereafter He saw that they were wicked (with the apparent exception of Noah and his family). I hope that cleared things up. I am so glad that you took the time to include that passage from [John 8], for you have prompted me to check that, and that has shown me that there are not one, not two, but three lines missing from my Bible! This is outrageous! And how did I miss this? Now I must wonder how many other missing verses there may be here...I'll be getting in contact with Holman Book Publishers, mark my words. Now I'm angry. But enough about that. The debate must go on. Obviously I concede to this, thank you. Again, the Ten Plagues of Egypt. http://www.publications.steveplatt.net... This article uses some Marr and Malloy as one source, so that's a bonus. There are some interesting points that I hadn't read about before now, too. I concede on the sins of the father. I concede on Jacob's spiritualistic name of Israel. I had left out [Exodus 3:22] because I had not deemed it of import. It seems I was wrong. If you please, the women did ask the Egyptian women to give them valuables. It was a common practice to give gifts to those who were leaving forever. But you must keep in mind that this is just after the occurence of the Ten Plagues. By the end of it, the Egyptians, who had just lost so many of their loved ones, would believe that the horrors of the epidemic had been sent by the divine--whether from their own gods or from the Hebrew God. They would have done anything for the Israelites, anything they'd asked, because the Egyptians were terrified and grief-stricken and weary. Even if the Israelites had not said it aloud, the obvious implication is, ""Give me your valuables or another plague will come."" So, God told the Israelites to take advantage of the distraught Egyptians. It's stealing, which He later forbids. ""Dead Zed."" You're so clever--I love it. Also I concede. I had confused myself somehow, which I realized right after I posted my argument. I was thinking more along the lines that the rest of Zedekiah's life was torment. Eh. Ah, let's see. I have 7500 characters remaining at this point, and there's another round after this one. I'll see what I can dig up. In [2 Samuel 24:1], ""The LORD's anger burned against Israel again, and He stirred up David against them to say: 'Go, count the people of Israel and Judah."" So God tells David to go and count his army. After the deed is done, David thinks that he has sinned despite following God's order. (It's a sin in that if David knows how many men there are, the enemy very well now knows it, too.) But why on earth does God punish David? [2 Samuel 24:15] - ""So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the appointed time [3 days], and from Dan to Beer-sheba 70,000 men died."" Concerning the death of Judas: [Matthew 27:5] - ""So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself."" [Acts 1:18] - ""Now this man acquired a field with his unrighteous wages. He fell headfirst and burst open in the middle, and all his insides spilled out."" I have seen several reconciliations of this passage, but none of them seem to be up to par. One was that Judas tried to hang himself, but failed and instead jumped to his death from a cliff on his property. But [Acts] states that he had fallen in a field, and Matthew does not say that Judas tried, and mentions nothing of this 'bursting open.' I'll leave it at that.

S82aa19d7-Adad69219	Men Should Have No Say Womens' Abortion Decision	"As indicated in the comments, as men being allowed to have opinions on abortion is largely uncontroversial (and to deny this is to commit a logical fallacy known as ad hominem, saying that a man's opinion is worthless specifically because he's a man), this debate will focus on whether or not men should have any say in whether or not a woman aborts her child, or in whether or not society should forbid abortions. I will make the following argument: P1) The unborn, from fertilization, are human beings. P2) Killing human beings is immoral. P3) Anyone can stand against immorality (this is not limited to a particular gender, race, etc.). C) Therefore, men can take a stand against abortion (including making it illegal, etc.). To support my first premise: Embryologists, who are the experts in the field, consistently agree that life begins at fertilization. For example, from the most-used textbook on embryology, the authors note: ""Although life is a continuous process, fertilization (which, incidentally, is not a 'moment') is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new genetically distinct human organism is formed when the chromosomes of the male and female pronuclei blend in the oocyte."" [1] Another embryologist has written the following: ""Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm unites with a female gamete or oocyte (ovum) to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual."" [2] On top of that, the more sophisticated pro-choice philosophers, like Judith Jarvis Thompson (who came up with the famous analogy of the violinist), and Peter Singer, accept the full humanity of the preborn. Peter Singer has noted, “It is possible to give ‘human being’ a precise meaning. We can use it as equivalent to ‘member of the species Homo Sapiens’. Whether a being is a member of a given species is something that can be determined scientifically, by an examination of the nature of the chromosomes in the cells of living organisms. In this sense there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being.” [3] Additionally, pro-choice philosopher David Boonin writes: ""Perhaps the most straightforward relation between you and me on the one hand and every human fetus on the other is this: All are living members of the same species, homo sapiens. A human fetus after all is simply a human being at a very early stage in his or her development."" [4] It's simply common sense. We know the preborn are alive because they grow. Non-living and dead things don't grow. They also exhibit the other signs of life, such as metabolism and cell division. The preborn have human DNA, and they are the product of human parents. Creatures reproduce after their own kind; dogs have dogs, cats have cats, and humans have humans. At no point in human development is a member of humanity a ""non-human."" This is also different from saying that a hair follicle has human DNA, so it is wrong to pluck them out. Zygotes/embryos/fetuses are unique individual humans, developing from within, made up of all the individual parts. A hair follicle must stay plugged in to the parent organism to function. However, the parent organism can still function even if he/she loses parts of their body. The zygote/embryo/fetus is a full human organism made up of individual parts of which it develops from within, not constructed like a car. Therefore, the unborn entity is the offspring of both the mother and the father. To support my second premise: This is largely uncontroversial. Killing adult human beings is wrong. What makes it wrong? Philosopher Don Marquis illuminates the reason in his famous article against abortion, Why Abortion is Immoral: “Some answers can be eliminated. It might be said that what makes killing us wrong is that a killing brutalizes the one who kills. But the brutalization consists of being injured to the performance of an act that is hideously immoral; hence, the brutalization does not explain the immorality. It might be said that what makes killing us wrong is the great loss others would experience due to our absence. Although such hubris is understandable, such an explanation does not account for the wrongness of killing hermits, or those whose lives are relatively independent and whose friends find it easy to make new friends. “A more obvious answer is better. What primarily makes killing wrong is neither its effect on the murderer nor its effect on the victim’s friends and relatives, but its effect on the victim. The loss of one’s life is one of the greatest losses one can suffer. The loss of one’s life deprives one of all the experiences, activities, projects and enjoyments that would otherwise have constituted one’s future. Therefore, killing someone is wrong, primarily because the killing inflicts (one of) the greatest possible losses on the victim.” [5] Killing human beings is wrong because it robs them of all their future experiences. Killing the unborn are also wrong for the same reason. To support premise three: This should also be largely uncontroversial. You didn't have to be African to oppose slavery in America, you didn't have to be Jewish to oppose the Holocaust. You don't have to be female to oppose slavery, or attempt to put an end to it. Conclusion: Therefore, the conclusion is supported. If men have no say in the issue, then you would have to remove pro-choice men from the equation, as well. We would have to overturn Roe v. Wade, in fact, because it was voted on by nine men. Anyone can oppose the killing of innocent human beings. So anyone, men included, can attempt to get abortion made illegal again, as killing older humans is legal. [1] Ronan O'Rahilly and Fabiola Müller, Human Embryology and Teratology, 3rd edition.

Sb33195c5-A7b3382e6	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"You must realize that God is impossible. If you look at the dictionary, here is the first definition of God that you will find:""A being conceived as the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions."" Most believers would agree with this definition because they share a remarkably clear and consistent view of God. Yes, there are thousands of minor quibbles about religion. Believers express those quibbles in dozens of denominations, but at the heart of it all, the belief in God aligns on a set of core ideas that everyone accepts. What if you were to think about what it would mean if there were a perfect, omnipotent, omniscient creator and ruler of the universe? Is it possible for such a being to exist? Epicures thought about it in 300 BC, and he stated thusly: ""The gods can either take away evil from the world and will not, or, being willing to do so, cannot; or they neither can nor will, or lastly, they are both able and willing. If they have the will to remove evil and cannot, then they are not omnipotent. If they can, but will not, than they are not benevolent. If they are neither able nor willing, then they are neither omnipotent nor benevolent. Lastly, if they are both able and willing to annihilate evil, how does it exist?"" In other words, if you sit and think about who God is supposed to be, you realize that such a being is impossible. In Matthew 7:7, Jesus says: ""Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"" The impossibility of God is visible here as well. Based on Jesus' statement, let's assume that you are a child and you are starving in Ethiopia. You pray for food. What would you expect to happen based on Jesus' statement? If God exists as an all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful parent you would expect God to deliver food to you. In fact, the child should not have to pray. Normal parents provide food to their children without their children having to beg for it. Yet, strangely, on planet Earth today we find tens of millions of people dying of starvation each year. Another way to approach the impossibility of God is to think about omniscience. If God is omniscient, then it means that he knows every single thing that happens in the universe, both now and infinitely into the future. Do you have free will in such a universe? Clearly not. God knows everything that will happen to you. Therefore, the instant you were created, God knows whether you are going to heaven or hell. To create someone knowing that that person will be damned to hell for eternity is the epitome of evil. Here is another way to understand this. If you look at the definition of God, you can see that he is defined as the ""originator and ruler of the universe"". Why does the universe need a creator? According to religious logic, the universe cannot exist unless it has a creator. A believer will say, ""nothing can exist unless it is created."" However, that satement immediately creates a contradiction, because we must then wonder who created God. For a believer the answer to that is simple- ""God is the one thing that does not need a creator. God is timeless and has always existed."" How can it be that the everything must have a creator, while God must not? As soon as your think about the concept of a perfect, omnipotent, omniscient being, you realize the impossibility of the concept. Plain and simple."	PRO	93
S88b62b30-A4144c003	The Bible is free of contradiction	"Thank you for your response. I would also like to thank you for your concise format--It's very easy to read and follow. I concede to the misinterpretation of [Genesis 1:25] and [Genesis 2:19]. I concede to your argument on the recordings of Jesus's last words, though I will say that the apostles are not the best biographers if they're going to be leaving all sorts of things out! I concede to the Proverbs on answering the fool. (And I commend you for your witty title.) As for God changing His mind: He did not decide to destroy His creation, it is true. But in [Genesis 1:31] - ""God saw all that He had made, and it was very good."" So, in [Genesis 6:6], He regrets having made mankind, and thus changes His mind in that all, which includes man, was good. Even a temporary change is still a change. The law for testification is written clearly, and Jesus does send for John's testimony shortly after [John 5:31]. But that does not change the fact that Jesus said that His testimony is not valid and then claims it is so in [John 8:14]. He exploited a loophole, but He still contradicted Himself. I concede to the misinterpretation of Saul's companions ""hearing"" the voice. I concede to the spiritual death of Adam. I concede to the fabrication of Saul's death by the Amalekite. Very sensible, actually. As for the language, the author did not mention survivors other than the eight who were on Noah's ark. However, after they landed, did Noah go and search the cities for survivors across the Near East? That would have been impossible in itself, let alone the whole of Mesopotamia, and with only eight survivors in the world you'd think there would be far less human phenotypical variation. But I will concede to this on the grounds that the author was being dramatic. Ah, the Ten Plagues. The first scientific source was from the History channel documentary ""The Exodus Decoded"" (2005). http://www.hulu.com... Er, it can be watched on Hulu, so there's commercials, but you can pick your ads. It's pretty good. The second was an article I'd found at the local library by Marr and Malloy. It's called An Epidemiologic Analysis of the Ten Plagues of Egypt. I can't seem to find an online source from which to read, but I'm sure your library should have it as well. Sorry about that. I quasi-concede regarding Herod's Slaughtering of the Innocents. There is no way to be sure exactly how many infants had been killed (perhaps maybe five to twenty), but even if there were only a few, it would have been a terribe, noteworthy act regardless of whether King Herod was mad or not. Josephus's recordings of Herod's ruthlessness was done carefully and in great detail, and it seems strange that he would leave out such a thing. Thank you for the source regarding starvation. As the source states, bodily factors such as genetics, health considerations, body weight, and hydration play important factors in starvation. I concede on this point. Seeing how we have a couple more rounds and you're very good at this (and I'm having fun), I will provide a few more contradictions. I begin. Ezekial speaks of many instances in which he received the word of God. In [Ezekiel 18:20] - ""The person who sins is the one who will die. A son won't suffer punishment for the father's iniquty, and a father won't suffer punishment for the son's iniquity..."" This is the word of God. Also, the word of God is seen in [Exodus 20:5] - ""...for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the father's sin, to the third and fourth generations."" Oh, so sin is hereditary. Who knew? But wait! What was all that You told Ezekial? Did You change Your mind, God? ----- In [Genesis 35:10] - ""God said to him [Jacob]: Your name is Jacob; you will no longer be named Jacob, but your name will be Israel. So He named him Israel."" This is all well and good, only later, in the same book: [Genesis 46:2] - ""That night God spoke to Israel in a vision: 'Jacob! Jacob!' He said. And Jacob replied, 'Here I am."" Between and thereafter that point, the author continuously switches between 'Israel' and 'Jacob.' But what gets me is that God Himself, who changed Jacob's name, calls him by the name he should no longer be named. ---- [Exodus 3:20, 22] - ""I [God] will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it...when you [Israelites] go, you will not go empty-handed...So you will plunder the Egyptians."" Basically God telling his Israelite chidren to despoil and plunder the Egyptians before they head out to the Promised Land. But later God prohibits stealing, defrauding, and robbing a neighbor: [Exodus 20:15, 17]. ---- My last exerpt for this Round will be concerning God's word to Zedekiah, king of Judah. [Jeremiah 34:4, 5] - ""Yet hear the LORD's word, Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully."" Despite this apparent promise, [Jeremiah 52:10, 11] - ""At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes and also slaughtered the Judean commanders. Then he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze chains...he kept him in custody until his dying day."" So he wasn't killed violently, but his death would have been anything but peaceful. Can you imagine the torment he would face for the rest of his imprisoned life having watched his children and loyal men killed? The nightmares! Again, thank you, and I look forward to the next round. Good luck."	CON	94

S5990b6b8-Ad4758c7e	All humans ought to assume that the Christian God does not exist, based on lack of evidence.	"Okay, now it's time for some rebuttals. First, though, to clarify: When I mentioned the burden of proof, I meant that, in a debate for the existence for the Christian God, the burden of proof would lie on the side of the person arguing for the existence of the Christian God. My opponent realized this, so I see no need to go any deeper into that aspect. Which is not to diminish the importance of the need for Christians to prove their God, of course. Rebuttals: -Con claims that the Big Bang theory cannot be taken as fact, because there is no way to prove that the Big Bang is the reason for the existence of the universe. It is true that there is no ""Big Bang Law"". However, there is Hubble's Law, which states that there is a direct correlation between the distance to a galaxy and its recessional velocity as determined by the red shift (1). This scientific LAW implies that universal expansion is taking place, and even describes exactly how this expansion takes place, supporting the Big Bang theory very well. Naturally, Con could easily claim God's responsibility for the Big Bang. In any case, evidence for a god, specifically the Christian God, is still needed, and my stance is not weakened. Hence the ""burden of proof"" I mentioned earlier. -Con claims that, based on my logic, the Big Bang theory cannot be accepted as valid. Is this really the case? It cannot be. The Big Bang theory is a scientific theory and backed up with scientific evidence- I already mentioned Hubble's law. Con asserts that the Big Bang theory ""contradicts the teachings of several religions"". As Con has not mentioned which religions the Big Bang theory supposedly contradicts, I cannot rebut this claim fully. However, the definition of ""religion"" is as follows: ""The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods."" (2) Once again, for religions to be accepted as scientific fact, there must be scientific evidence for what they teach. Religions require scientific proof for the existence of each's ""superhuman controlling power"" or powers to be accepted as valid by science. As the Big Bang theory seeks to explain the formation of the universe through expansion of a singularity, there must be evidence of universal expansion for the theory to be supported. Which there is. For the Christian creationist standpoint to be supported, because of the Christian creationist's standpoint's reliance on the existence of God, the existence of God must be supported. There is no scientific evidence of the existence of God; therefore, the Big Bang theory is supported by science, and the Christian creation is not. I mentioned ""lack of evidence"" in the title. Scientific theories ARE supported by scientific evidence; they merely cannot be used to predict outcomes with certainty. The difference between a scientific law and a scientific theory is that a law can be used to predict outcomes with certainty. Just as Hubble's Law can. To actually even stand against scientific theories such as the Big Bang, religious versions of creation require scientific evidence for the existence of their creator beings. The singularity theory is supported by evidence (which is why it is a scientific theory), and the Christian creation is not, simply because there is no scientific evidence for a God. Con does not seem to have yet disputed the lack of evidence. The validity of the Christian creation always depends on the existence of a God. God could have logically caused the Big Bang, could he not? How is the observer to know how the Big Bang happened, in the case of God causing it, without proof of God in the first place? My argument does not negate the title, as is seen. -Con asserts that my point about Christianity not being valid because of its contradiction by all other religions does not mean that Christianity is not a valid belief. My point was meant to be taken in the current context, with all religions lacking scientific evidence for themselves. When various proposals with no evidence to back them up are argued over, how is a person logically justified in choosing any one proposal to put their faith in? I mentioned in earlier arguments the need for Christians to prove themselves right over all other religions, and, if an omnipotent being is proven to be real, the need for Christians to prove that being is the Christian God. As there is no scientific proof for any superhuman controlling being, belief in any religion is not logically justified. The burden of proof is still on Christians to prove the existence of their deity. Known scientific fact is the starting point, so to speak; to justify belief in a divine, all-powerful entity, ""existence in a divine, all-powerful entity"" must join the realm of ""scientific fact"", because, as I mentioned before, science is composed of observations that support other observations, and such observations are the best ones that humans have. The starting point, science, based on proven observation, is the entity to be added to. Science is merely observation of the natural and physical world. Science is the evidence all humans ought to base their beliefs on. This includes beliefs in deities. Any theist treats their deity as a scientific fact, as an observation supported by evidence. The problem occus when that observation is not actually supported by any evidence. Now over to Con. 1. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu... 2. Oxford Pocket Dictionary of English"	PRO	96

Sb33195c5-Aac50b8d5	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"Hello and thank you so much for accepting my challenge. I wish you like, too. First of all, I should mention that I am Muslim. So I quote my Scripture and Diving Book which is Qur'an/Koran You said that God didn't answer our supplication. You're right somehow. But I must explain something to you: God wants us to pray. He loves listening to our supplication. Because when we pray, we show God that we need Him. We show our weakness. And God loves that. We are weak. But God is the Most Powerful. Everything belongs to Him. He is the Lord of the worlds. If we study on attributes of God, we'll find that He is not mean and stingy. When we ask God for something, He will grant us, indeed. As He said in Quran: ""And your Lord says, ""Call upon Me; I will respond to you."" (Quran 40:60) So if God doesn't answer our prayer, we must know that it is our fault. We have done something bad which upsets God. We have committed sin. Another reason is the way we pray. We don't know how to supplicate. In the following, I tell you some ways which make God answer your prayer: 1. Remembering God all the time: There are some people who pray when they are ill, when they have problem, when they are in danger. It's not good at all and God dislikes it. These people only remembers God in hardship and forget Him when they are happy. We should always remember God. He said to Muhammad:""And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect. 18:28"" And also, He says in another verse:"" And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues in disobedience as if he had never called upon Us to remove an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing. 11:12"" God revealed to David:"" Remember me and pray in ease. So I will answer you in hardship."" 2. We must pray sincerely, not heedlessly. 3. We must put our trust in God. We also must be sure that God will answer it. 4. We must be disappointed in anyone other than God. We must believe that no-one can help us but God. He is sufficient for us. 5. We must try and work after praying. For example, I am poor and ask God to grant me money. If I just sit at home and do nothing, do you think God answers my supplication? No he doesn't. Because I must work to earn money. So God helps me to get more money. Sometimes, we pray correctly, but God doesn't answer. because we have disobeyed him. Or we didn't worship him as we should do. For example, God says:"" O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. 2:208"". God asks us not to follow Satan but we do. There are more reasons that God doesn't answer our prayer. For example, we pray for something which is bad for us. But we think it is good. God knows everything and wants the best for us. So he doesn't answer our prayer. ""Perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not."" (Quran 2:216) And also, God wants to answer our prayer, but he doesn't do so immediately. Because he wants us to keep praying. He loves us and loves listening to our voice. I don't know what you mean by stoning teenagers to the death. But I want to tell you something. Do not believe in whatever is written in the Bible. Because some parts of Bible (not all of it) is corrupted. The Scriptures are nonsense. If you have any question about Quran, I can answer you. But Bible is not the Word of God anymore. God dislikes when people disobey Him. Do you know why? God gives us everything. He always helps us when we need him. He always grants us what we ask Him. He is The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful. ""But if they turn away - then know that God is your protector. Excellent is the protector, and Excellent is the helper. 8:41"" ""Sufficient for us is God, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."" 3:173 God grants us many favours. But He just wants us to do two things in return; worshipping him and thanking him for his favours. God doesn't need our worship. There are many angels who glorify God. Indeed, we need our worship. We offer prayers for our benefit. But we don't know it. We don't know the philosophy of worship. There are many people who forget God and enjoy their life. They do whatever they want. They do evil things and hurt others. They commit sin and corrupt themselves. Don't you think they deserve punishment? These peoples love this world and neglect the hereafter. ""And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew. 29:46"" God punishes the evil people. But it doesn't mean God hates them. No, God loves them. God loves all of us. He just punishes to purify the people. Sins corrupts us but the punishment of God purifies us. I want to tell you some verses of Quran: ""[O Muhammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful. And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment. 15:49-50"" ""Say, ""O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."" 39:53 ""O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people."" 12:87 "" And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided. 2:186"" "" And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein."

S82aa19d7-A3330be5f	Men Should Have No Say Womens' Abortion Decision	Thank you to my opponent for his arguments. Because my opponent has the burden of proof, I only need to rebut his arguments. I don’t need to present any arguments of my own. However, I would like to make a few general comments before I discuss his argument specifically. Abortion is not some glorious freedom for women or even for feminists. Abortion is awful, invasive and sometimes traumatic. Women who do not want to get pregnant should not be getting pregnant. The fact that they are, in such large numbers, is a sad indication of the power balance in sexual relationships. Germaine Greer says it best: “If we accept every abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. A woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility, who cannot suggest another way of making love or ask for a condom to be used, is certainly not calling the shots… Because he ejaculates when and where he ejaculates, she conceives against her will…The crowning insult is that this ordeal [abortion] is represented to her as some kind of privilege. Her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right.” [1] There is nothing desirable about abortion. However, what my opponent suggests – that women should be prevented from having abortions – is even more horrible. It’s allowing women no more power over their bodies than domestic animals have. The resolution is that men should have no say in women’s abortion decisions. Absolutely correct. It can be extended, though, that women shouldn’t have a say in any abortion decision other than their own. Each woman should have the sole power to make decisions about her own body. And now to my opponent’s argument, which he presented in four parts. P1) The unborn, from fertilization, are human beings. Yes. This seems reasonable. I’ve never had much liking for the “just a mass of cells” argument. However, until about 6 months’ gestation, these “humans” are unable to live independently. They are parasites on the host mother. Also, for pragmatic reasons, they are not defined as human beings in a legal sense. It’s using emotive language to say that an abortion is murder of the unborn. Another way to see it is as separating the foetus from the mother. She is denying it access to her body. Of course, the result is that it dies. But the difference is important. Women should have sovereignty over their own bodies. They shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice themselves physically to support other people. P2) Killing human beings is immoral. Yes, usually. But we allow exceptions to the rule in our society. For example, killing in self-defense. Also, failure to intervene (in the absence of duty of care) to save lives is never punished. Even when the intervention required is negligible, say, just calling 9-1-1 or fetching someone’s medicine from their handbag, there is no law requiring people to do it (except in Vermont and Minnesota where there may be a small fine). [2] Of course, this doesn’t mean that failure to intervene isn’t immoral. Indeed, how could you ever think well of someone who stood with their mobile in their hand and watched someone die when they could have made the call to save them? But we recognize that much of morality is private. That people make moral and immoral decisions and that they cannot all be (and should not all be) subject to external control. Abortion, obviously, is one of these private decisions. P3) Anyone can stand against immorality (this is not limited to a particular gender, race, etc.). This is such an ambiguous statement, because immorality is subjective and “stand against” could mean anything at all. For example, in Bangladesh, it’s considered immoral for a woman to travel alone, to shake hands with strange men and to walk about in public with bare shoulders. Of course, there will be some among the 150 million Bangladeshis who don’t think this way. However, there will also be several million Bangladeshi men who feel very strongly about these things and who feel moved to “stand against” any immorality they come across. Can they? Should they? And to what extent? Would it be OK for them to take a stick and whack any offending woman? How about imposing a law to forbid women from leaving the house without a male relative? How about some kind of ritual humiliation for offending women so that everyone can watch and learn? No, no, and no. So, on the whole, I disagree with my opponent’s statement. He’ll need to be more specific. C) Therefore, men can take a stand against abortion (including making it illegal, etc.). Con said: “If men have no say in the issue, then…[w]e would have to overturn Roe v. Wade, in fact, because it was voted on by nine men.” I think my opponent is making a little joke here. Until relatively recently, all legislation was written by men and all court decisions were made by men. There is nothing in the resolution to suggest that I support overturning all these decisions. However, if we were to overturn all decisions made by men, we would have to include the decisions that made abortion illegal in the first place, all the rulings of the Catholic Church, and indeed most of Christianity, which has been very male dominated. And we would end up where we started, which is with nothing to prevent women from making decisions to abort or not to abort for themselves. It really is a woman’s own decision, and I’m glad my opponent has failed to prove otherwise. [1] Germaine Greer, The Whole Woman, Transworld Publishers Ltd, 1999. p. 89.

In order to win, one must not only refute the other's arguments, but must also bring their own case in favor of their respective claims. I will argue the affirmative of the resolution and my opponent will argue the negative. Definitions Robots: metallic beings programmed to rape, murder, torture, and pillage the human species until it is completely erradicated. These robots would also especially target those who are unable to defend themselves, such as babies, children, cripples, and elderly people. Destroy: any means used to erradicate or hurt the human species, including but not limited to murdering, torturing, raping, pillaging, stabbing, purple nurpling, and other varieties of hurtful deeds. Human life: any member of the species, Homo Sapiens. Including but not limited to children, toddlers, newborns, fetus', the elderly, librarians, gays, straights, asians, libertarians or any other being who could be considered as part of the human species. More moral: to perform moral actions more often than that which one is being compared. Morality: conforming to the rules of right conduct. Other clarifications In the scenario in which we will be arguing, no divine creator or deity will exist. One of the reasons being that it is unable to help the humans in time of attack. My definitions and other clarifications will not be up to debate. Once one accepts this debate, they necessarily accept my definitions and other clarifications.	PRO	103
S5e0e0dca-A379b6d2a	God didn't really do these bad things from the bible as is said that he did	"here are some tripped out stories that are supposedly from ""God"". the thing to note, is that a lot of the bible isn't justifiable but isn't from God to begin with, perhaps. such as how to treat women as property, how to properly beat your slaves, or to stone virgins. but the bible says these following things came from God. 1. God killed everyone on the planet in a flood per noah. notice all the flaws in the story that are way too far fetched to take seriously. 2. God commanded a dude be stoned for gathering sticks on the sabbath. 3. God caused the first born of every person who didn't smear blood on their door to be killed. 4. God told someone to kill their innocent kid to prove his allegiance to God. 5. a laundry list of bad things God has done (put in a humorous way) https://io9.gizmodo.com... the thing to note is, such as we can tell that the story of noah is blatantly false (when a miracle occurs, the science should corroborate it, not contradict it, as occurs with the noah story), plus we have at least arguably other inconsistencies in the bible.... why should we take this stuff as true given all that? i think trying to say this stuff is figurative or something is just a scapegoat. the bible and the people who read it have taken this stuff liberally. but that doesnt mean it has to be true. the only way a person would think it's true is because the bible says it is. i've yet to hear decent justifications for any of these sorts of stories. yet, we see some of the stories are objectively false. religous people don't get a ""get out of logic free"" card to think as they please just because they take the bible as it says, or have beliefs that are religious in nature. if their logic is ""well the bible is true so this must be true"", that doesnt fly with me and is illogical. i can't say just because the bible isn't always reliable that this story isn't true, but i can say on its face these sorts of strories dont make sense to sane people. it's clear there's a defect in the minds of people who try to justify this stuff, and that they have a hard time dealing with reality."

God knows about every blade of grass and every leaf. He placed them there. He structured all the brains of every human. If a soul exists, he created every bit of it. Everything is in his knowledge, all of which he made. Therefore, nothing can be operating outside of his control. All that he made he has a plan for and nothing can divert from that plan.

S5e0e0dca-A9585422b	God didn't really do these bad things from the bible as is said that he did	First let me correct some of your errors, the Bible was written by men but inspired by God so It did come from God. God does not expect mankind to live perfectly and nowhere in the Bible are the rules, laws and punishments laid out for us to create a perfect society. The reason the Bible talks about how to treat a slave is not because the Bible encourages slavery but because the world is evil and slavery will always always exist, the Bible just outlines the proper way for slaves to be treated. Anyone who says slavery does not exist or is illegal has never considered the correctional systems in place in America and other countries today. Almost all governments will throw you in jail and make you work for little to no reward if you stop paying taxes or commit any number of crimes. The Bible teaches how to treat slaves not how to beat them. The Bible does not tell us to stone virgins but it did teach the Jews to stone people for what you may consider minor offences. You seem to misinterpret the Bible a lot and jump to extreme conclusions so I will need you to give me chapter and verse for any more examples. What makes you say the story of Noah is false? The problem you seem to have with God and the reason you find him evil is his extreme punishments and ease with which he ends human lives. It all boils down to the question why is killing wrong. Death and murder are difficult concepts for us to accept because we are the center of our own universe and full of pride. You may not think it is morally justified for God to kill a human, simply because you have humanized God and consider him an equal to us with some sort of magical power. God has created this universe and has every right to destroy it if he so desires meaning that killing is only wrong if God says it is. The Bible teaches its alright to kill animals, man has dominion over the beasts of the field and we are encouraged to hunt for food and clothing. The reason we can not kill each other is simple, man was created in the image of God. An artist who creates a statue of himself is the only person who can deface or destroy that statue. Anyone who damages an image of God would be insulting God. One of the things making us different from animals is that we are made in the likeness of God and only he has the right the end our lives early but keep in mind we all die eventually and the world will always be full of death. The stories from the Bible that make you think God is cruel only show how much greater than us he is. Pride is a sin and only a proud person can believe God doesn't have the right to do what he wills. God has every right to kill or punish people and he would not be cruel or unjust. God is holy and his judgments harsh because sin does anger him, its not a sin for an artist to destroy his art or a creator to destroy his creation. I believe everything in the Bible literally and the only issues are when its poorly translated or taken out of context. Meaning you sometimes need to read deeper to see what the author is trying to say. Please show me anything in the Bible that isn't true and the evidence for it.	CON	111

Sd8e1a478-Ae115ac40	Country landowners should have the right to enjoy their own private property as they see fit.	"My family own a number of extensive rural properties, three in Europe and another in one of Britain's former North American colonies – the United States, where the natives rather quaintly refer to country estates as ""ranches"".* Over in America, country landowners are quite entitled to use firearms to defend their property from trespassers and, furthermore, they are also permitted to exercise their right to hunt vermin such as raccoons, cougars and manatees using guns, traps or horses and hounds as they please. However, here in England, if a landowner takes a pot shot at some errant rambler who has strayed off the public footpath and onto his property, he can find himself in pretty hot legal water. Indeed, gentleman farmer Tony Martin was found guilty of murder simply because he shot a couple of trespassing teenagers in the back as they tried to flee his property. This travesty of justice disgraced the English legal system as the landowner, being a man of superior breeding, was brought up to expect such matters would be overlooked in the light of his elevated social status (and no doubt generous donations to the local police benevolent fund). Furthermore, he only killed one of the boys and in any case, they were frightfully common little oiks, one of whom had a distinctly foreign look about him. Thankfully, Mr. Martin was well connected socially and the judiciary duly ordered his release from prison. He now gives lectures on the menace of filthy little proles who think they have the right to wander willy-nilly over one's private property. http://www.dailymail.co.uk... Now I turn to the subject of hunting with hounds. Sadly, thanks to the loony-left British Government's ban on hunting with hounds, the days are long gone when a group of respectable sportsmen could set a pack of viscous dogs onto a defenceless fox and watch them humanely tear the animal limb from limb. http://www.league.org.uk... These days a gentleman mounted upon his horse, cannot even chase down and bludgeon to the ground anti-hunt protesters without being summoned to appear in court, such is the audacity of these so-called bleeding heart liberal-types who film our rural activities. http://www.realca.co.uk... Indeed, the fear of prosecution has obliged landowners to hire lackeys from the surrounding villages to track down and rough-up any do-gooders that may be in the vicinity, thus denying rural gentlefolk the pleasure of horse-whipping some sandal-wearing riff-raff to within an inch of their life. http://www.realca.co.uk... Put simply, the urban elite of Britain's Labour Government just don't understand the rural way of life and they certainly don't understand that a country landowner should have a right to do as he pleases on his own private property. * Please follow the links listed hereunder to satellite images of the properties in question: ï¿½England (Chigwell) http://maps.google.co.uk... ï¿½Slovakia (Klastor) http://maps.google.co.uk... ï¿½Slovakia (Ostrava) http://maps.google.co.uk... ï¿½USA (Bradenton, FL) http://maps.google.co.uk..."

Sb33195c5-Ae0fafbd8	Why do some people deny the existence of God? (Only Atheists)	"I gladly accept this challenge and wish good luck to the instigator. Prayer does not work. We pray to God in the hope that He will answer our prayers and listen to our woes. Prayers are supposed to be sacred, sincere conversations with a higher power. Since one of the basic beliefs about God is that He is omnipresent, He should be in each of our hearts and acknowledge our pleas. Try praying tonight. Try asking for something that is in good intentions, like the curing of a terminally-ill relative, or the recovery of a lost family heirloom. Wait for Him to listen to you and heed your prayer. Wait, nothing changed? This is odd. Jesus claims in Matthew 7:7, ""Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened... how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"" How can there be no response to wholehearted prayers? The answer is simple, there is no one listening to you. God hates anyone who does not please him. Read Exodus 35:2. It says, ""For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death."" Consider the application of such a statement to society today. Think about that how many people work on the Sabbath- practitioners in medicine, law enforcement, etc. This passage from the Old Testament is stating that God wants these people put to death for not following his commands. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 gives another ridiculous statement, ""If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town, ""This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard."" Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid."" This insinuates that any and all rebellious teenagers should be put to death, with no chance of redemption. Again, apply this to a society such as today's where more and more teenagers are becoming unruly and lackadaisical. Would it make sense to commit genocide against the youth of today for not honoring their parents? It would not. I will post more arguments in the next round."	PRO	117

Noah and his sons and their wives repopulated the earth and inbreeding was not a problem because their DNA had not been damaged by Sun, so yes we are all inbreed. Prior to Noah's ark there was a barrier of water above the earth that prevented direct sunlight. The flood is believed to have been caused by this barrier of water coming down at once. Keep in mind the Bible does not say how deep this flood was but there is scientific evidence pointing towards a global flood. The Bible never says that millions of species were on the Ark and it does not say they were adults, it was probably full of young creatures. The Ark had the same storage capacity as about 450 standard semi-trailers. A standard livestock trailer holds about 250 sheep, so the Ark had the capacity to hold at least 120,000 sheep. After the flood there were land bridges and the different animals populated the different countries, even the kangaroos. The fresh water did not mix with the salt water, even in a flood the fresh water remains fresh until the flood water meets the ocean and then it will become salt water. The creatures in the oceans wouldn't be affected because the fresh water would not make a huge impact on a body of water the size of the ocean and the fresh water creatures if washed into the ocean would die but if enough were able the stay in their original lakes to repopulate then their species would not be in danger. To answer your previous question,""how is there all kinds of races of people that takes hundreds of thousands of years to differentiate, when the flood happened suppoedly within the last ten thousand years?""
