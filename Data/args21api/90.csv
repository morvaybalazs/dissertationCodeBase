Sccb2cd3b-Abcbebb4e	they drink anyway why not let them do it legaly	Allowing teenagers to drink at the age of 18 won’t ensure that they drink responsibly – just that they can’t be punished for it! The teenage brain is not a developed as the 21 year old brain and they will more likely hae a drinking dependency or liver damages before they can even drink legally. Thousands are admitted to university hospital each year for alcohol poisoning.	CON	2
