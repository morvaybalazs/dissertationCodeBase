(They can print more or just not accept a currency). Sure a bomb could end the world.. we technically have ‘planet crackers’ of a kind, we’ve had nuclear warheads thousands of times stronger than the Hiroshima bomb, 40 years ago the Tsar ‘kind of bombs’ was detonated and that was only half its potential because it might kill too much.. Technology is knowledge and is not by itself a bad thing, it is in fact our wisdom of using such knowledge that leads to catastrophes.. Sure without the knowledge that probably couldn’t happen, but without continual progress we would not be able to support society as it grows. The power generated by nuclear weapons has also stopped world wars due to the fear of ‘mutual annihilation’ and currently provides a great percentage of the power requirements of the modern world which otherwise would be burning fossil fuels and trees to the point of exhausting those resources.

Or even to create a virus to steal and hack peoples accounts and get well hard earned money all over the world. No money means no life.	PRO	2
