NFP is much more effective than BC, and has no harmful side effects. BC is known to cause breast cancer and many other serious health problems such as blood clots and strokes in very young as well as older women. Couples who use BC have an incredibly high divorce rate, while couples who use NFP have a divorce rate below one percent. So if you cannot financially support a child or you have another just reason to avoid pregnancy than use NFP. Contraception does not reduce the numbers of abortions. Contraception has very high failure rates, but most people are unaware of this, and because of the high availability of contraception there is a much higher number of people having sex than if it was not available, than when the contraception fails, abortion is often seen as the alternative. While it true that condoms can reduce the risk of some STD's they do not protect against the most common STD, HPV, and they actually increase the number of people infected with aids and other STD's for the same reason they increase the number of abortions.\"}}, {'_index': 'text-preprocessed', '_id': 'f3fff523-2019-04-18T13:04:43Z-00006-000', '_score': 11.206028, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': 'Pro: \"This debate is about contraception being a right.\" And I have proven it is not a right.

Smaller businesses are not required to provide health care for their employees. https://www.healthcare.gov...(yes, that link actually works!) Having a legal business structure has several advantages, it provides personal protection (owner does not have to pay all the debt when the business goes bankrupt), tax advantages, etc. On the other hand, there are also obligations. Companies have to withhold federal /state income taxes, social security and Medicare taxes. So the company mediates between the government and the employee. Large companies are also required handle health care insurance for their employees. Again, this should be viewed as an obligation not a right. The government requires the employee to have health care (which mandates coverage for birth control). Companies have some discretion in choosing the health care, so that they can get a better deal by collective bargaining. This discretion should not be interpreted as a right. The company is still mediating between the government and the employee . If anyone would have a right to reject the mandate for birth control coverage, it would be the employee. The government requires everyone to have health care. For employees of large companies, employers are charged with the administrative task to make sure that employees have coverage. What is covered by the insurance concerns the employee, the insurance company and the government, but not really the employer. The employee, insurance company and government all have incentives for contraception coverage. If the employee uses contraception, she gets coverage for it. If she does not use it, it does not matter. Note that most women, even catholic ones, use or have used some kind of contraception. The insurance has a financial incentive to cover contraception, because it is cheaper. (More about this later.) The government ‘s goal is to provide the cheapest health care with the best coverage for its people. My opponent dropped her argument that the mandate would lead to discrimination Employer interference in employees health-care insurance is unreasonable What is reasonable? A pacifist should not have forced to fight in a war. (If there is a war draft he could do a different useful war.) That would be reasonable. It would be unreasonable if he does not pay taxes because some tax money will go to defense. A catholic employer should not have to buy contraception for their employees. That is reasonable. But it would be unreasonable for the employer, not to regulate health care insurance for the employees if these insurance policies happen to cover contraception. My opponent even believes, that a Jehovah’s witness should have a right to prevent an employee from having health insurance that covers (possibly life-saving) blood transfusions. Well, that seems to me unreasonable. Employers cannot argue that they would be paying for contraception First of all, contraception coverage is cheaper than no contraception coverage. “Some studies have looked at cost-savings for private insurers specifically. Notably, the federal government, the nation’s largest employer, reported that it experienced no increase in costs at all after Congress required coverage of contraceptives for federal employees in 1998. A 2000 study by the National Business Group on Health, a membership group for large private- and public-sector employers to address their health policy concerns, estimated that it costs employers 15–17% more to not provide contraceptive coverage in employee health plans than to provide such coverage, after accounting for both the direct medical costs of pregnancy and indirect costs such as employee absence and reduced productivity. Mercer, the employee benefits consulting firm, conducted a similar analysis that year and also concluded that contraceptive coverage should be cost-saving for employers.” http://www.guttmacher.org... But even if it was not cheaper, then employers still could not say that they are paying for contraception coverage: Suppose that employers were given the option not to pay for the coverage certain procedures/products that they object to. For example, instead of contribution to contraception coverage, they would pay for child birth coverage instead. In that case, the cost of contraception coverage would come from other employers who do not have the same objections. But giving employers such option would mean a lot more unnecessary administration, and in the end it would not make any difference.'}}, {'_index': 'text-preprocessed', '_id': 'f82359c8-2019-04-18T13:56:01Z-00003-000', '_score': 11.096959, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': \"okay here's my arguments. !. abortion can not only kill the baby but may cause future medical problems for the mother. 2. abortion promotes a culture in witch human life is disposable 3. the original Hippocratic oath traditionally taken by doctors when swearing to practice medicine ethically, forbids abortions 4. if women should become pregnant they should accept the responsibility that comes with producing a child. 5.women should not use abortion as a form of contraception.

The English Oxford dictionary defines Libertarianism as the following - 'An extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens. ' . http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Libertarians should not believe in the state forcing employers to fund their employees health care as Libertarianism as an ideology is charactarised by minimal intervention , especially in spheres that can work fine without it. -Argument from Morality- This is not an argument for why Libertarians shouldn't believe in forcing employers to pay for contraception , this is an argument for why everybody shouldn't . My opponent , by advocating for state intervention when Hobby Lobby doesn't want to pay for it's employees health care is saying this is a good course of action meaning equivelent to -good. My opponent has to prove how stealing from people to fund unessential healthcare that is already affordable in the US (Additionally she doesn't have to get contraception for herself , she can buy condoms for the man) is neccessary and morally right. I don't believe it is morally right to force someone to give up their property to fund something that is not neccessary , in fact it is cruel as this money goes to something they claim their religion does not support. Now I will try to address my opponent's arguments. Argument 1) 'People should not be forced to be parents. ' I agree , Force defined by the Oxford English Dictionary is - ' Strength or energy as an attribute of physical action or movement:' -. http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... By simply not paying for something I am not forcing you to do anything . Nobody forces you to have sex because they are not paying for your protection, You can just stop having sex, clearly that is the best way to not get pregnant . My opponent has to prove how people are forced most of the time to have sex . On the other hand by making employers pay for employees healthcare you are actually using a threat of violance to get the funds , people have historically gone to jail for not giving money to the government . See example -(. http://www.forbes.com...) Argument 2) ' The health of some women would be threatened by pregnancy and childbirth. I am one of those women' A women has the free will to choose to have sex or not, she also has the free will to buy protection or not , therefore it is irrelevant if she faces danger from her choices as the danger is not caused by coercion (See definition at - . http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... ) The danger is caused by choice , What my opponent is advocating for is equivelent to -Because some people make the choice to engage in extreme sports , we should force people to pay for their injuries if they suffer from some. Additionally it does not matter because it has nothing to do with the ideology of Libertarianism, I remind my opponent that the debate is over if Libertarians should believe that the state should coerce employers into paying for their workers contraception not if a women should use contraception. Argument 3) ' 3. Contraception would allow women to be in the work force longer. ' Therefore this women should pay for her own contraception, It will benefit both the Employer and the Employee while coercing Employers into it is another unneccessary regulation that reduces the amount of capital the company can invest which helps the economy, even if forcing the Employers to pay for their Workers contraception was benefitical to the economy , again it is irrelevant to why Libertarians should support it and it is the opposite of what Libertarianism stands for (Minimal Intervention) , Libertarians should believe in Minimal Intervention because this is what their ideology advocates for. Argument 4- 'There would be less unwanted children born to be abused. I do understand opposing abortion, but it makes no sense to oppose abortion. Who is less likely to have an abortion than women who are not pregnant? ' My opponent has not used statistics to prove that in countries where contraception is free less children are abused . Her argument again is not relevant to Libertarianism. I am not advocating for women to stop using contraception , I am simply advocating for the state not to coerce companies such as Hobby Lobby to pay for this contraception. Where is the evidence that if woman have to pay for contraception out of their own pockets mean that they just won't and that they will have children instead , this is underestimating the intelligence of women and can be compared to saying they are dumber then men (Yes it's women who have to take care of babies most of the time but men are also often forced to pay child support) . If a women definatly does not want a child she can alternatively give up the child for adoption.

Obviously I am arguing the position in contrast to that of the Roman Catholic Church, and so I cannot win by using only their teachings. I will now begin my argument, starting first with the story of Onan. As it says in the Biblia Sacra Vulgata (Genesis 38:8-10)\"(8) dixit ergo Iudas ad Onam filium suum ingredere ad uxorem fratris tui et sociare illi ut suscites semen fratri tuo(9) ille sciens non sibi nasci filios introiens ad uxorem fratris sui semen fundebat in terram ne liberi fratris nomine nascerentur(10) et idcirco percussit eum Dominus quod rem detestabilem faceret\" [1] It is indeed easy to see how this might be taken as an argument against contraception. \"[Onan] sui semen fundebat in terram\", and in that way made God angry at him. But why was God angry? It is never specifically stated why. He could have been mad at Onan for not giving his brother\\'s wife a child, for being disobedient, for polluting the ground, for any number of things. This is quite clearly a specialized case, as Onan was given a specific task which he clearly rejected. It is equally probable that God was angry at him for shirking his duty as it is that God struck against him for using contraception. My case:1. Contraception allows for planningContraception prevents children from springing up inconveniently. If you barely have any money and you\\'re living in a dumpster, surely you do not want a child? Contraception can prevent children from being born into horrible lives.2. Contraception can prevent abortionWhich is worse? It is clearly much better to use contraception than to get an abortion. As it is unreasonable to expect no one to have sex, contraceptions save lives by preventing abortions.3. Forms of contraceptives prevent STDSSTDS are bad. Some contraceptives prevent them. Therefore, contraceptives are good. I will shore up my case in the next round. I again thank my opponent for giving me the opportunity to argue devil\\'s advocate for the first time. Sources:1.

However, male condoms are 98% effective, whilst female condoms are 95% effective. The contraceptive pill is 99% reliable. Contraceptive implants are 99% reliable. You could also use a condom and the pill together whilst having sexual intercourse, which makes it twice more reliable. Considering that contraception is so reliable. It is very unlikely that the 40% rise (and in areas where sex education has been specifically targeted) is to do with contraception being so unreliable. [2] Pro also states that another reason could be down to inexperienced teenagers. The whole point of sex education is to teach teenagers how to put a condom on. So, if more teenagers are struggling to put condoms on, that shows sex education is not doing it's job right and it is ineffective. Pro has shown this. Also, there are other methods of contraception, there isn't just a condom. I don't believe these two reasons is for the dramatic increase in teenage pregnancies in the last few years. Here are more of my points: [1] Sex education is also not right for the children ages. The images are so graphic for young children, and things are far too much. For example, 5-year-olds get taught about erections, masturbation, orgasms and prostitution. I'd hardly call that education children about contraception. In a nutshell it is teaching them how to do sex. They also tell 5-year-olds how their parents have sex. It is all in this article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk... It is too much too young. This sort of material is not suitable for 5-year-olds. [2] The UK also lacks the teachers with training to provide a good sex education lesson. The teachers who tend to teach the subject are ones that come from all sorts of subjects. And who are not specially trained in teaching sex education. Which also puts UK pupils at a disadvantage. [3] The UK should learn from other countries when it comes to sex education. Did you know that teenage pregnancies in Holland is one-fifth as high as the UK. The way they teach sex education is different to how it is taught in Britain. In the Netherlands, sex education is brought to pupils in the form of a relationship and not in the form of a biology lesson. If we took lessons from countries with a lower teenage pregnancy rate than here, we may see an improvement in this country. [4] Also, I can understand teaching pupils how to use contraception. But why is it necessary to teach children how to actually have sex. It is a natural thing. Humans have been doing it for thousands of years. Why do we suddenly need to get taught how to have sex. I'm in agreement with teaching pupils how to use contraception and (like the Netherlands) relationship advice. But, like the link I posted above, why that sort of content?

A famous example of this is the gleeful way in which liberals point out that the self-described \"Pro-Life\" community tends to support war, the death penalty, and other things that do not match up well with the description of \"pro-Life.\" I want to discuss another set of ideas that are connected to the abortion debate - sexual activity. I observe that most of those who oppose abortion, even those who do so vehemently, (abortion is murder, abortion is baby-killing) also tend to strongly oppose policies that would prevent abortion, but also facilitate sexual activity. Obviously, not all anti-abortion activists share this \\'idea set.\\' However, most seem to. I will argue in this debate that opposing policies such as improved contraception access, while at the same time arguing that \\'abortion is murder,\\' is one of the many poor combinations of \\'idea sets\\' in the abortion debate. I will ask my partner to challenge my premise by arguing that opposition to contraception (specifically) is consistent with the assumption that \"abortion is an act of killing babies.\"To be clear, I want to instigate this debate in order to resolve the following question: \"Can a person believe that \\'abortion is baby-killing\\' and also argue that contraception ought to be opposed in many cases without some loss of logical consistency?\" The structure of the debate should follow this schedule: R1-Acceptance (opening statements are fine, but please no detailed arguments) R2- We shall both examine the nature of the presented argument, to determine if the inclusion of (p2) weakens the conclusion. I expect that CON will offer an alternative argument that can more comfortably incorporate (p2). Argument: p1: Abortion is murder p2: Contraceptives are bad, ineffective, unnecessary, or other p3: Opposition to contraception availability (etc) is justified C: The use of contraceptives should not increase in certain ways (This is obviously simplified, and is not binding for this debate.) R3- We will compare any competing arguments, and attempt to resolve differences between them. R4- Both debaters will evaluate the overall debate, and attempt to draw conclusions. My conclusion will attempt to defend my thesis, that anti-contraceptive arguments destabilize the assumption that \"abortion kills babies,\" and my opponent will challenge. \"Abortion\" must refer to the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, and not to miscarriage or pregnancies that fail due to passive or accidental means. Additionally, \"abortion\" cannot be interpreted as being caused by hormonal or chemical injections, supplements, or prosthetics, such as IUDs, Emergency Contraception \"The Morning After Pill,\" or any other strategy that effectively makes a viable pregnancy impossible during the first 6 weeks following conception. \"Abortion is murder/killing babies\" Abortion may be considered to be \"killing babies,\" in this discussion, but not \"murder,\" since murder is a technical term that describes illegal actions. Abortion is a constitutionally protected right. \"Contraception\" must refer to any deliberate strategy to prevent a viable pregnancy that occurs within 6 weeks of sexual activity. \"Proper use\" must refer to the use of contraception in a manner that is recommended by the manufacturer of that contraceptive method, and the majority of health professionals.'}}, {'_index': 'text-preprocessed', '_id': 'd2bea018-2019-04-18T18:06:32Z-00001-000', '_score': 10.487127, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': \"Preventing STDs and unwanted pregnancies is not a reason for masturbation over sex, given my opponent's statements on contraception.

The OT remains important in Christianity but only to lay the foundations for fulfillment and redemption thru Jesus in the NT.

PRO ignores historical and cultural climate in Old Judaism Numbers 31 - Onan and his brother’s wife Levirate marriage, where the brother of a deceased man marries his brother's widow out of compassion, is practiced in old Israel. So Onan is married to his late brother’s wife. Contraception/coitus interruptus is not the sin itself but the method by which the sin is committed. The sin is the squander of God’s blessing (bear children) and the refusal to fulfill marital obligations (procreation). God punished Onan for neglecting his marital obligations by practicing coitus interruptus. He married for the sexual pleasures only. Hosea 9 - Kill every woman that hath known man by lying witah him This does not refer to abortion. Moses discovered that the Israelites had engaged in mass sexual indiscretions resulting to STDs. They were punished (capital punishment) for adultery and prostitution.

PRO ignored the context around these scriptures and why God laid out the punishment - Blasphemy Rebellion against God thru promotion of immoral acts Adultery and prostitution Mass Incest and Pedophilia Sex with animals Cannibalism It is true that God’s punishments are harsh but there are underlying historical precedent. In all of these cases, God sent prophets to redeem the community, however, they remain unrepentant, and since the immorality is entrenched culturally, God saw it fit to end that society’s lineage. In all of these, PRO is simply wrong to interpret God’s punishment as equivalent to God's promotion or support of casual abortion/contraception as PRO stated in the motion. PRO is confused between Judaism and Christianity This debate is about Christian traditions. And in Christianity, God revealed himself thru Jesus with a NEW covenant that supplants the teachings in OT. God thru Jesus is about compassion, mercy, solidarity and forgiveness.

Now, contraception was prohibited in the OT (don’t spill your semen) but there was no mention in the NT. But to be clear this debate is about Christian scriptures (NT) in support of abortion and contraception as stated in the motion. And just because contraception was not mentioned in the NT, it does not automatically equate into a support.

Look at both these issues and judge for yourself if contraception is part of the solution or part of the problem. Because of the widespread use of birth control, more people than ever have sex without intending to have children. Sex out of wedlock has become far more common, and more sex means more babies. Some argue that teaching people how to use contraceptives will alleviate the problem. But research shows that \"programs in safer sex education and condom distribution have not reduced the out-of-wedlock birth rates among sexually experienced teens. . . . The fact is, increased condom use by teens is associated with increased out-of-wedlock birth rates.\"[1] A few years ago in Colorado, one school began passing out condoms to the students. Within three years the birth rate rose 31 percent above the national average, and in one school year one hundred births were expected among the twelve hundred students. The administrators were described as \"searching for explanations.\"[2] When unwanted pregnancies occur, many turn to abortion as a solution. In fact, studies show that about half of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion.[3] Some argue that increased use of contraception could have lowered these abortion rates. However, the research institute of the nation\\'s largest abortion provider admits that most women who receive abortions had been using birth control during the month they became pregnant![4] Such couples feel that the \"fault\" of the pregnancy can be blamed on the failed contraception, but by contracepting they have already set their wills against new life. Since contraception treats pregnancy as if it were a disease, many people conclude that abortion must be the cure. I once saw a condom advertisement that called pregnancy \"the mother of all nightmares.\" With this mentality it is no surprise that the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey said, \"At the risk of being repetitious, I would remind the group that we have found the highest frequency of induced abortion in the group which, in general, most frequently used contraceptives.\"[5] Even a former medical director of Planned Parenthood admitted in 1973, \"As people turn to contraception, there will be a rise, not a fall, in the abortion rate.\"[6] Fifty million abortions later, no one can dispute his prediction. Lastly, it should be noted that anyone who believes that contraception decreases abortions ignores the fact that hormonal birth control can cause abortions.[7] Click here for details on that. Mother Teresa did not need to see the statistics. She was well aware of the connection between contraception and abortion when she said in a speech in the presence of Bill and Hillary Clinton: \"The way to plan the family is Natural Family Planning, not contraception. In destroying the power of giving life, through contraception, a husband or wife is doing something to self. This turns the attention to self and so destroys the gift of love in him or her. In loving, the husband and wife must turn the attention to each other. Once that living love is destroyed by contraception, abortion follows very easily.\"[8] __________________ [1].

It is often said that with optimum use of the Pill, it should have an effectiveness rate of 99 percent. Therefore, it is said to have a \"method\" failure rate of about 1 percent. However, in typical use the rates change significantly. This can be caused by many things, such as a woman\\'s forgetting to take her pill or taking it at the wrong time of the day. Thus the actual rate, called the \"typical\" or \"user\" failure rate. For the first year of use for women under the age of twenty, the Pill has an annual failure rate of 8 to 13 percent.[21] One study that followed sexually active teenage girls on the Pill found that 20 percent of them became pregnant within six months![22] The typical failure rate of the Pill has been shown to vary according to such factors as a woman\\'s age, race, marital status, education, and economic status. For example, one large study showed that poor teenage girls who lived with their boyfriends had a 48 percent chance of getting pregnant during their first year on the Pill, whereas a wealthy married woman over the age of thirty had a 3 percent chance of pregnancy.[23]\" (Chastity.com)'}}, {'_index': 'text-preprocessed', '_id': 'af12bbe3-2019-04-18T15:38:01Z-00006-000', '_score': 10.097092, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': 'I will do my best.
