So it could not have been for that. God is very merciful, so it seems very unlikely that God would kill someone just for polluting. Yes, contraception allows for planning children but so does NFP. NFP is much more effective than BC, and has no harmful side effects. BC is known to cause breast cancer and many other serious health problems such as blood clots and strokes in very young as well as older women. Couples who use BC have an incredibly high divorce rate, while couples who use NFP have a divorce rate below one percent. So if you cannot financially support a child or you have another just reason to avoid pregnancy than use NFP. Contraception does not reduce the numbers of abortions. Contraception has very high failure rates, but most people are unaware of this, and because of the high availability of contraception there is a much higher number of people having sex than if it was not available, than when the contraception fails, abortion is often seen as the alternative. While it true that condoms can reduce the risk of some STD's they do not protect against the most common STD, HPV, and they actually increase the number of people infected with aids and other STD's for the same reason they increase the number of abortions.\"}}, {'_index': 'text-preprocessed', '_id': 'f3fff523-2019-04-18T13:04:43Z-00006-000', '_score': 11.206028, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': 'Pro: \"This debate is about contraception being a right.\" And I have proven it is not a right.
